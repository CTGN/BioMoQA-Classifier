",,,,"Tropical forests have, in equal measure, fascinated and frustrated naturalists, explorers and scientists for centuries. Few other terrestrial ecosystems confront ecologists so plainly with their empirical and theoretical shortcomings. As Marlow, the narrator of Joseph Conrad's Heart of Darkness muses ‘… all that mysterious life of the wilderness that stirs in the forest, in the jungles, … He has to live in the midst of the incomprehensible, which is detestable. And it has a fascination, too, that goes to work upon him’. For botanists, ecologists and zoologists working in tropical forests, the remarkable diversity is intriguing and captivating, but simultaneously overwhelming. Thirty years ago the flow of new research from tropical forests was but a trickle. As Joe Wright, a senior scientist with the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute (STRI), notes in his foreword to this excellent volume, one or two new papers a week on tropical forests in those days meant that it was relatively easy to stay abreast of the current research. By the mid-2000s, however, this trickle had become a torrent, with the number of publications on tropical forests increasing by nearly an order of magnitude. No longer is it possible for students of tropical forests to keep up with all of the new research being published on the subject. Carson and Schnitzer's timely volume provides a much-needed stock-taking of ideas about the ecology of tropical forests, looking both backwards to the observational foundations and forwards to the theoretical and empirical future of tropical forest ecology.

Two major advances in tropical forest ecology – one methodological and one theoretical – animate this book. The first is the establishment of large-scale, permanent forest-dynamics plots in most of the major tropical forest regions of the world. These plots are typically 25–50 ha in size and catalogue, every 5 years, the size, location and species' identification of every tree with a diameter at breast height >1 cm. The logistical challenges of creating and maintaining these plots are enormous, but over the past 25 years, STRI and its Center for Tropical Forest Science (CTFS) have not only successfully developed the protocols for doing so, but have expanded the network of tropical forest plots to now include 18 sites with ∼3 million trees representing ∼6000 species. The CTFS plots provide statistically useful samples of tree communities and the species' populations that comprise them. This has enabled both robust quantitative estimates of demography, spatial patterning and abundance, and, because of the standard protocols across the CTFS network, has allowed direct comparisons of these estimates among tropical forests differing in location, seasonality and species' diversity. The impact of the CTFS plots on tropical forest ecology is plainly seen in Carson and Schnitzer's book, in which over half of the chapters are either based on or heavily cite research conducted in CTFS plots.

The second major advance, which stems from the first, is the development by Steve Hubbell of the neutral theory of biogeography and biodiversity (Hubbell, 2001) based on his work at the first CTFS plot at Barro Colorado Island, Panama. In brief, Hubbell proposed that patterns of species' abundance in forest samples can be predicted from a model with a small number of free parameters and simplifying assumptions about processes such as speciation and recruitment. Neutral theory has jolted a discipline long focused on describing patterns and processes into carefully questioning many of its most fundamental assumptions. The simplifying assumption of neutral theory that has received the most attention is that species' identity is unimportant (i.e. all species are equivalent) in describing relative species' abundance in tropical forest communities. This is controversial because it plainly contradicts over 50 years of ecological and botanical work on tropical tree species' biology. Several of the chapters in this volume, a wonderfully readable one by Hubbell included, address and explore this gap between neutral and niche-based models of relative abundance.

Together, these advances have led to a gathering shift away from old theoretical ideas (Janzen–Connell effects, gap-phase dynamics) about tropical forest ecology to new ones (neutral theory, recruitment limitation) and a growing appreciation for, and understanding of, stochasticity in tropical forest communities. The many contributing authors in Carson and Schnitzer's book detail this shift and contemplate the ways forward. The book itself is neatly divided into five sections (each with 3–6 chapters): (1) Large-scale patterns in tropical communities; (2) Testing theories of forest regeneration and the maintenance of species diversity; (3) Animal community ecology and trophic interactions; (4) Secondary forest succession, dynamics, and invasion; and (5) Tropical forest conservation. For readers like me, who enjoy dipping non-linearly into edited volumes, Carson and Schnitzer's first chapter presents a nice overview of the book by giving a 1–2 paragraph description of the key points of the chapters, their broader relevance, and their connections to other chapters. With surprisingly few exceptions, the chapters are concise, well-written and thought-provoking. Importantly, the editors were broad-minded in their definition of tropical forest community ecology. The inclusion of excellent chapters by, for example, Peres on soil fertility and arboreal mammals, Dyer on tritrophic cascades, and Arnold on endophytic fungi provide a nice counterbalance to the many chapters on tropical trees. The concluding chapter by Putz and Zuidema questioning the relevance of ecology to the conservation of tropical forests may seem a bit of a surprise in such a volume – indeed, they directly contravene the bland rainforest conservation chapter by Corlett and Primack – but is a breath of fresh, pragmatic air and should be read by all ecologists interested in the future of tropical forests. Does this volume have any shortcomings? I would have liked a chapter on palaeoecological insights into tropical forest ecology and I thought the two chapters on tropical forest succession were weak, but these are minor quibbles. The book is well-edited, well-produced, nearly free of typos (annual gross production in neotropical forests is not 3 kg C ha−1!) and (in paperback) very affordable.

In conclusion, the recent advances in data collection and theory described in this volume have made the past decade one of the most exciting and important periods in the study of tropical forests. Carson and Schnitzer and the many contributing authors capture this excitement and the tectonic shifts that are underway in this new book. If you intend to buy only one book on tropical forest ecology in the next 10 years, buy this one. It is, simply put, outstanding.

They continue to be degraded through habitat loss, pollution and invading species and conservation measures are urgently needed to halt declining trends in their biodiversity and integrity. 2. During the past decade a suite of decision support tools and computational approaches have been developed for efficient and targeted conservation action in terrestrial or marine ecosystems. These methods may be poorly suited for planning in freshwater systems because connectivity in terrestrial and marine systems is typically modelled in a way unsuitable for rivers, where connectivity has a strong directional component. 3. We modify the conservation prioritization method and software, zonation , to account for connectivity in a manner better suited to freshwater ecosystems. Prioritization was performed using subcatchment/catchment‐based planning units and connectivity was modified to have directional upstream and downstream components consistent with the ecology of our target species. 4. We demonstrate this modified method for rivers and streams in the southern North Island of New Zealand. Data included predicted occupancy from boosted regression tree models of species distributions for 18 fish species. The study area covered 2.1 million hectares and included 394 first‐ to fourth order catchment or subcatchment planning units. 5. Realistic modelling of connectivity had a major influence on the areas proposed for conservation. If connectivity was ignored, recommended conservation areas were very fragmented. By contrast, when connectivity was modelled, high priority conservation targets consisted of entire river basins or headwater subcatchments. 6. The proposed method serves as a starting point for the implementation of reserve selection methods in river ecosystems.

",,,,"Abstract: The potential for conservation of individual species has been greatly advanced by the International Union for Conservation of Nature's (IUCN) development of objective, repeatable, and transparent criteria for assessing extinction risk that explicitly separate risk assessment from priority setting. At the IV World Conservation Congress in 2008, the process began to develop and implement comparable global standards for ecosystems. A working group established by the IUCN has begun formulating a system of quantitative categories and criteria, analogous to those used for species, for assigning levels of threat to ecosystems at local, regional, and global levels. A final system will require definitions of ecosystems; quantification of ecosystem status; identification of the stages of degradation and loss of ecosystems; proxy measures of risk (criteria); classification thresholds for these criteria; and standardized methods for performing assessments. The system will need to reflect the degree and rate of change in an ecosystem's extent, composition, structure, and function, and have its conceptual roots in ecological theory and empirical research. On the basis of these requirements and the hypothesis that ecosystem risk is a function of the risk of its component species, we propose a set of four criteria: recent declines in distribution or ecological function, historical total loss in distribution or ecological function, small distribution combined with decline, or very small distribution. Most work has focused on terrestrial ecosystems, but comparable thresholds and criteria for freshwater and marine ecosystems are also needed. These are the first steps in an international consultation process that will lead to a unified proposal to be presented at the next World Conservation Congress in 2012. Resumen: El potencial para la conservación de muchas especies ha avanzado enormemente porque la Unión Internacional para la Conservación de la Naturaleza (UICN) ha desarrollado criterios objetivos, repetibles y transparentes para evaluar el riesgo de extinción que explícitamente separa la evaluación de riesgo de la definición de prioridades. En el IV Congreso Mundial de Conservación en 2008, el proceso comenzó a desarrollar e implementar estándares globales comparables para ecosistemas. Un grupo de trabajo establecido por la UICN ha formulado un sistema inicial de categorías y criterios cuantitativos, análogos a los utilizados para especies, para asignar niveles de amenaza a ecosistemas a niveles local, regional y global. Un sistema final requerirá de definiciones de ecosistemas; cuantificación del estatus de ecosistemas; identificación de las etapas de degradación y pérdida de los ecosistemas; medidas de riesgo (criterios) alternativas; umbrales de clasificación para esos criterios y métodos estandarizados para la realización de evaluaciones. El sistema deberá reflejar el nivel y tasa de cambio en la extensión, composición, estructura y funcionamiento de un ecosistema, y tener sus raíces conceptuales en la teoría ecológica y la investigación empírica. Sobre la base de esos requerimientos y la hipótesis de que el riesgo del ecosistema es una función del riesgo de las especies que lo componen, proponemos un conjunto de 4 criterios: declinaciones recientes en la distribución o funcionamiento ecológica, pérdida total histórica en la distribución o funcionamiento ecológico, distribución pequeña combinada con declinación, o distribución muy pequeña. La mayor parte del trabajo se ha concentrado en ecosistemas terrestres, pero también se requieren umbrales y criterios comparables para ecosistemas dulceacuícolas y marinos. Estos son los primeros pasos de un proceso de consulta internacional que llevará a una propuesta unificada que será presentada en el próximo Congreso Mundial de Conservación en 2012. In the last 50 years, humans have altered the world's ecosystems more than during any other time span in history. Twenty to seventy percent of the area of 11 of the 13 terrestrial biomes evaluated in the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (2005a) has been converted to human use. Although informed and effective policy may slow land conversion (Watson 2005), there is no consistent, widely accepted scientific framework for tracking the status of Earth's ecosystems and identifying those with a high probability of loss or degradation (Nicholson et al. 2009). Recognizing this gap, the fourth IUCN (International Union for Conservation of Nature) World Conservation Congress launched a process to develop criteria for assessing the status of and establishing a global red list of ecosystems (IV World Conservation Congress 2008). We use the term ecosystem as an assemblage of organisms that occur together in space and time and interact with each other and their physical environment (Odum 1971). The IUCN uses quantitative and qualitative criteria to classify species by their probability of extinction (i.e., extinction risk) and to guide policy and interventions at all levels (IUCN 2010a). Furthermore, the IUCN's criteria are the basis for some of the Convention on Biological Diversity's indicators (CBD 2003, 2010) and indices of biological diversity (Butchart et al. 2004, 2007), which are being used to track progress toward international conservation targets (Millennium Development Goals 2009; Walpole et al. 2009). At national scales, species red lists inform policy and action in more than 100 countries and provide ample data for other conservation applications (IUCN 2010a; Zamin et al. 2010). Ecosystem red lists have the potential to complement the policy successes of species red lists in several ways. Ecosystems may more effectively represent biological diversity as a whole than do individual species (Noss 1996; Cowling et al. 2004), especially given the taxonomic bias of the current IUCN Red List (Vié et al. 2009; Stuart et al. 2010). Moreover, they include fundamental abiotic components that are only indirectly included in species assessments (e.g., riverine ecosystems; Beechie et al. 2010). Declines in ecosystem status may also be more apparent than extirpations or extinctions of individual species; society often perceives loss of biological diversity in terms of loss of benefits such as clean water, food, timber, and fuel (Millennium Ecosystem Assessment 2005a). Ecosystem-level assessments may also be less time consuming than species-by-species assessments. Despite concerted efforts, by 2010 the status of only 47,978 of the world's 1,740,330 known species (<3%) had been evaluated for potential inclusion on the IUCN Red List (IUCN 2010a). Furthermore, red lists of ecosystems may suggest areas in which extirpations are likely to result from extinction debt in response to loss and fragmentation of species' habitats (Terborgh 1974; Terborgh et al. 1997; Tilman et al. 1994) because decline in the extent and status of an ecosystem may precede the loss of its species. When used in tandem with species red lists, ecosystem red lists could provide the most informative indicator to date of the status of other elements of biological and abiotic diversity. Our objective here is to initiate a global consultation on the development of categories and criteria for a red list of ecosystems that is based on the best available science and draws from the experiences of the IUCN (2010a). Key challenges must be addressed to develop robust methods to assess the probability that the status of ecosystems has declined or will decline. These challenges include defining ecosystems and the spatial units appropriate for assessment and determining a set of thresholds within criteria, thresholds such as amount of decline in geographical distribution or degree of degradation that must be reached in order to qualify for a corresponding category (e.g., endangered, vulnerable). The criteria and thresholds need to be broad enough to encompass many different types of ecosystem classifications, and yet specific enough to allow their application to geographical extents relevant to conservation decision making. We ask scientists with relevant expertise to join us in building a scientifically sound, credible, and objective system for assessing the level of threat to ecosystems worldwide of elimination or degradation. Several protocols for assessing ecosystem status have been applied already, and they provide a base on which to build a global standard (Nicholson et al. 2009). In Australia, as a result of a continuing national assessment of ""ecological communities,"" by 2008 40 communities had been listed as threatened under federal law, and many more have been listed by states (Department of Environment and Conservation of New South Wales 2009; Department of Environment and Conservation of Western Australia 2009). Similarly, the South African National Environmental Management: Biodiversity Act (DEAT 2004) resulted in the identification of over 200 threatened ecosystems (Reyers et al. 2007; SANBI & DEAT 2009). Analogous assessment frameworks have been proposed for European countries (Austria, Paal 1998; Essl et al. 2002; Raunio et al. 2008), the Americas (Faber-Langendoen et al. 2007), and other regions (Nicholson et al. 2009). To integrate these initiatives for assessing ecosystem status into a single global system, a shared vision of the goal is essential. We envision that a unified system for assessing ecosystem status will be based on criteria that are transparent, objective, and scientifically sound, and thresholds that are associated with different levels of risk of elimination and loss of function, are easily quantified and monitored, and facilitate comparisons among ecosystems. The criteria must be applicable to terrestrial, marine, and freshwater systems at multiple spatial extents (local to global) and resolutions (fine to coarse) and to data from diverse sources, both historical and current. Like the IUCN Red List criteria for species, a global set of criteria for ecosystems must be easily understood by policy makers and the public. Additionally it should be made explicit that risk assessments are just one component of conservation priority setting and thus should be consistent with the species-based approach for red lists. To achieve this vision, multiple scientific challenges must be met, starting with a definition of the basic ecosystem units to be assessed. Classical definitions of ecosystem (e.g., Whittaker 1975) and those used in the Convention on Biological Diversity include both biotic and abiotic components that interact ""as a functional unit"" (CBD 1992). Under this definition ecosystems occupy a defined geographic area and can be nested within other, larger ecosystems, with the largest ecosystem of all being the biosphere. Following a principal division by abiotic factors (terrestrial, freshwater, marine), most authorities, for example, recognize 15 terrestrial biomes (e.g., tundra, boreal forests, temperate grasslands) (Millennium Ecosystem Assessment 2005a). Ecoregions are subdivisions of biomes defined by the biogeographic patterns of their biota (Olson et al. 2001). Most units of practical interest for evaluation, however, may occur at extents smaller than biomes and ecoregions. For example, the terrestrial ecosystems of the conterminous United States are defined by internally consistent characteristics of species composition, vegetation structure, climate, and landform (Sayre et al. 2009). Similar groupings of ecosystems are applicable to freshwater and marine systems (Spalding et al. 2007; Abell et al. 2008). In some cases, a focus on biological components may be essential for assessing the risk that ecosystems are degraded or ultimately eliminated. For example, in terrestrial ecosystems not threatened by mining or other activities likely to produce changes in abiotic factors, this focus is likely to result in the use of ecosystem as a generic term for ecological communities or for sets of relatively distinct assemblages of species that co-occur in space and time in association with particular abiotic features (Christensen et al. 1996; McPeek & Miller 1996; Jennings et al. 2009; Keith 2009; Master et al. 2009). For many terrestrial ecosystems, as well as some aquatic ones, land-cover classification may be the most practical approach for delineating units for assessment (e.g., Benson 2006; Rodríguez et al. 2007). In some freshwater (Sowa et al. 2007) and most pelagic and deepwater marine systems (Roff & Taylor 2000), the delineation of assessment units may rely more heavily on abiotic features. For example, freshwater systems could be examined following a hierarchical riverine classification system (Sowa et al. 2007), whereas deepwater marine systems could be categorized by geophysical variables such as depth, slope, and substrate (Roff & Taylor 2000). To construct useful units for ecosystem assessment, the selection of variables should be informed by empirically demonstrated relations with species composition. Because a unified worldwide delimitation of ecosystems is unlikely to occur in the near future (Rodwell et al. 1995; Scholes et al. 2008) and because conservation policy is developed and applied at multiple scales (Watson 2005), we believe the focus must remain on developing criteria for status assessment that are applicable to diverse ecosystem classifications. Delimiting ecosystems is complex, but defining threat levels for ecosystems and determining the trajectory toward their loss may be even more so. As composite entities, ecosystems may be considered ""eliminated"" when only one key component (such as top predators or keystone pollinators) is lost or, at the other extreme, when the last biotic element is lost. We believe the scientific community needs to focus on developing a pragmatic, standardized approach intermediate between these extremes (i.e., Rodríguez et al. 2007). Elimination will usually be a gradual process; losses of species and ecosystem functions will lag behind declines in loss of area (Lindenmayer & Fischer 2006). Aquatic systems present challenges because ecosystem conversion and loss of function may be widespread but not easily detectable (Millennium Ecosystem Assessment 2005b; Nel et al. 2007). The assessment system must reflect changes over policy-relevant time scales (e.g., years to a century); thus, critical signposts need to be developed that indicate status and threats en route to ecosystem elimination, just as have been developed for species (Mace et al. 2008; Keith 2009). Because direct measurement of the level of threat to ecosystems and species is costly and difficult, assessments need to use surrogate measures of risk, or ""criteria"" (Mace et al. 2008), that are related to risk consistently across a range of ecosystem types. As in the case of species red lists (IUCN 2010a), ecosystems should be assessed relative to all criteria but need to meet only one criterion for listing under a ""threatened"" category (Fig. 1). A logical starting point for these criteria in ecosystems, already incorporated into many existing ecosystem-assessment protocols, is the IUCN Red List for Threatened Species (IUCN 2010a; Table 1). Because ecosystems in part are composed of species, criteria that apply to species may partly apply to ecosystems. Furthermore, the present system for assessing species is based on well-established scientific theory and empirical results and has been tested extensively (Mace et al. 2008). Criteria for assessing ecosystems should therefore be consistent with those for species, but may need to be adapted to accommodate relevant ecosystem theory (e.g., Scheffer et al. 2001). The process of ecosystem-extinction risk assessment. Ecosystem data on one or more quantitative proxy risk indicators (criteria) are evaluated against thresholds to assign a threat category (critically endangered [CR], endangered [EN], or vulnerable [VU]) to the ecosystem. In the case of species, assessment criteria are derived from estimates of geographical distribution, abundance, and their temporal trends (IUCN 2001; Mace et al. 2008). Thus, the process of ecosystem assessment could begin by estimating an ecosystem's geographical distribution and degree of degradation and temporal trends in these variables (Table 1; Fig. 1). In terrestrial systems, temporal trends in the distribution of land cover have been proposed and applied as criteria for assessing the status of some types of ecosystems (Benson 2006; Reyers et al. 2007; Rodríguez et al. 2007). For example, the Cape Flats Sand Fynbos, in southwestern South Africa, is listed as critically endangered because the expansion of Cape Town has resulted in a reduction of over 84% of the original extent of the ecosystem (Reyers et al. 2007; SANBI & DEAT 2009). Methods for extrapolating the historical distributions of ecosystems continue to be developed and improved (e.g., Rhemtulla et al. 2009; Morgan et al. 2010) and will undoubtedly aid the application of distribution-based criteria. Nevertheless, the abundance and trend-based criteria used presently for species assessments may lose meaning in the context of ecosystems (which do not simply consist of ""individuals"") because in ecosystems changes in spatial extent represent the endpoint of processes such as structural conversion and functional decline. Therefore, additional criteria are needed to standardize reliable measures of ecological function (Table 1) for which threats may be assessed in at least three dimensions: immediacy, scope, and severity (Master et al. 2009). For example, clear-cutting a forest may represent functional loss that is immediate, widespread, and severe, and may lead to irreversible changes in ecosystem composition, structure, and function, including regime shifts and permanent declines in geographical distribution of the ecosystem (Scheffer et al. 2001). In this context, indicators of functional loss may include specific measures of threat (e.g., increases in the proportion of invasive species or pollutant levels), measures of structure (e.g., changes in species richness, trophic configuration, or guild diversity or status of particular keystone species, such as seed dispersers or pollinators), or measures of function (e.g., changes in nutrient cycling, trophic complexity, energy flows, biomass accumulation, or patterns of water flow) (Nel et al. 2007; Nicholson et al. 2009). For example, in New South Wales, Artesian Mound Springs is listed as an endangered ecological community because its artesian aquifers have been largely depleted, not because its geographical extent has been changed (Benson et al. 2006; New South Wales Government 2009). Integrating the challenges and existing research outlined above, then, our proposed system combines measures of geographical distribution, ecological function, and their temporal trends over short and long periods in a manner analogous to the assessment of species for the IUCN Red List and results in four criteria (Table 1): rate of recent decline (in distribution or function); total historical decline (in distribution or function); limited current distribution with ongoing decline (in distribution or function); and very limited distribution without ongoing decline. Once criteria have been resolved, a further task will be quantifying thresholds for each criterion that reflect different levels of risk (i.e., vulnerable, endangered, critically endangered; Fig. 1) across ecosystem types and spatial scales. Again, these thresholds may be based on IUCN Red List thresholds for species, but must accommodate relevant ecosystem theory (Table 1). Species-area relations, for example, may inform the definition of thresholds for criteria on the basis of changes in geographical distribution, as has been done in South Africa (Desmet & Cowling 2004; Reyers et al. 2007) and other regions (Nicholson et al. 2009). These and other basic ecological principles from island biogeography and metapopulation theory allowed the assessment of threats to tropical dry forests in Venezuela. This assessment applied thresholds in land-cover loss and the rate of change in land cover across multiple spatial scales (Rodríguez et al. 2008). Although the theoretical basis of extrapolating species-area relations to risk assessment has been questioned (Ibáñez et al. 2006), these examples demonstrate the type of theoretically grounded approach that may produce robust thresholds for assessing risks to ecosystems at multiple scales. Developing thresholds for loss of ecological function may require more complex criteria to reflect variation in immediacy, scope, and severity (Master et al. 2009), such that severe, widely distributed, and ongoing loss of function leads to assignments to the highest levels of threat (Table 1). For example, an ecosystem would be considered critically endangered if it were to experience a severe decline in function over a large portion of its distribution (>80%) and the threatening process was ongoing or expected to commence in the near term (Table 1). Lower risk levels, such as ""endangered,"" could be assigned if the decline in function was equally severe, but the extent was less. By presenting preliminary, relatively simple criteria and thresholds (Table 1; Fig. 1), we do not imply that arriving at a final, unified system for assessment of ecosystem risk will be easy; in addition to the conceptual challenges, there are methodological and logistical issues to confront. For example, what is the best method for measuring the geographical distribution of an ecosystem? Or, how does one precisely define a location? The IUCN produces periodically updated, detailed guidelines for addressing these methodological questions in reference to species (IUCN 2010b). We expect that the development of analogous guidelines for ecosystems will be a major component of the consultation process that will take place over the next few years. Nearly 15 years passed between the initial development of criteria for the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species and their official adoption (Mace et al. 2008). To minimize delay in the adoption of such criteria for ecosystems, it will be crucial to formulate a unified proposal for criteria and thresholds and make this proposal available online in scientific and popular venues. Protocols will need to be tested in a broad set of institutional contexts, geographical regions, and ecosystem types, and the protocols will need to be useful at local and global scales. The institutional capacity of IUCN and other participating organizations will need strengthening to implement such a global assessment of ecosystem risk. It is important to differentiate ecosystem risk assessment—a scientific, technical activity—from priority setting, a fundamentally societal, value-laden activity (Possingham et al. 2002; Lamoreux et al. 2003; Miller et al. 2006; Mace et al. 2008). As species red lists have demonstrated, transparent, objective, and scientifically based assessments are prerequisites for sound policy and planning (Mace et al. 2008). To ensure the scientifically credible application of criteria in red listing of ecosystems, case studies are needed to show how risk assessments can inform priority-setting efforts. Although the scientific and logistical challenges to developing criteria for an ecosystem red list are substantial, we believe the time is right to do so. Current opportunities include ongoing assessments at local and global scales, a strong IUCN mandate from governments and the conservation community, public concern worldwide about ecosystems and human dependence on them, a rich experience with the species red-listing process, and continuing and massive improvements in data collection and computing power. What remains is to engage the world's conservation and ecosystem scientists in this task. We are grateful to R. Akçakaya, E. Fleishman, S.

In contrast to northern polar areas, the dipteran fauna of Antarctica is depauperate, with only two naturally occurring species of Chironomidae. Surprisingly little is known of the biology of these species. One, Parochlus steinenii, reaches the southern limit of a distribution covering the high Andes, Tierra del Fuego, South Georgia and the South Shetland Islands in the maritime Antarctic. The other, Belgica antarctica, is endemic to the maritime Antarctic. What factors influence the distribution and past colonisation of these two species in the Antarctic?
Distributional data and evidence from an accidental introduction of a third chironomid (Eretmoptera murphyi) suggest that difficulty of colonisation is the major factor limiting the number of dipteran species present in the maritime Antarctic. Other sub-Antarctic species are likely to be preadapted to more rigorous conditions, should natural or man-induced colonisation opportunities occur.
Evidence from physiological and ecological studies identify adaptations which allow these two species to survive in the harsh terrestrial environment of Antarctica. Life history characteristics of all three species include flexibility in development rates and size achieved, and the ability to continue activity at low positive temperatures. The distribution of the endemic B. antarctica is probably limited by the availability of suitable moist, vegetated, habitats and its brachyptery, rather than biological constraints directly, whereas the southern distribution of P. steinenii may be temperature-limited. Competition does not appear to be an important factor in the biology and ecology of either species, or in Antarctic terrestrial ecosystems generally.

",,,,"Field surveys of free-living terrestrial microarthropods were made during the 1994–95 summer at four sites in northern Marguerite Bay (Anchorage Island, Lagoon Island, Léonie Island, Rothera Point; c. 68°S, 68°W) and three on southern Alexander Island (Two Step Cliffs, Fossil Bluff, Ablation Valley; c. 71–72°S, 68°W). Detailed site descriptions are presented, as little previous information exists. Twenty species (four Collembola, 16 Acari) were recorded from the Marguerite Bay sites, with a maximum of 17 species at one site. A further four species (one Collembola, two Acari, one Diptera) have been recorded from the same area by other authors. Species diversity at these sites, in particular Léonie Island, is as great as at any known site elsewhere in the maritime Antarctic, although the total area of terrestrial habitat available is small. Individual species and total population densities are also similar to, if not greater than, published studies from the South Shetland and South Orkney Islands. None of the species is new to the maritime Antarctic, although the distributions of several are extended southwards. Only nine species (maximum seven at one site) were found on Alexander Island, concurrent with decreases in population densities to levels similar to those found in many continental Antarctic studies. This still represents a high species diversity for such a high latitude site. The richness of two sites, Ablation Valley and Mars Oasis (Two Step Cliffs), is unlikely to be repeated elsewhere on Alexander Island. The Alexander Island fauna is clearly related to that of the maritime Antarctic, as all except one species occur at more northerly sites elsewhere on the Antarctic Peninsula, and none in the continental Antarctic. One species, Friesia topo (Collembola), is known only from Alexander Island.

The average height of the trees correlated positively with the number of strictly terrestrial species but negatively with shore species. The difference between the number of strictly terrestrial species, predicted from the multiple regression equation, and that observed was proportionally larger on smaller islands. There was evidence that plant species carried by animals dispersed less efficiently to the islands. The flora contained proportionally fewer of these species with decreasing island area. The converse was true for water—dispersed species and some wind—dispersed (those with pappi). These observations are consistent with the hypothesis of higher extinction rates on small islands.

",,,,"When parthenogenetic populations of terrestrial animals have different geographic distributions than closely related bisexual populations, the sexual forms tend to occupy regions of higher biotically imposed stress, generally being found at lower latitudes and altitudes, in mesic rather than xeric areas, on the mainland as opposed to islands, and in undisturbed as opposed to disturbed habitats. If sexual reproduction is favored by unpredictably changed conditions, then it would appear that regions of greater biotic stress are more unpredictable than those where abiotic factors are a major source of stress. We suspect that this greater unpredictability stems from interspecific interactions (competition, predation). We further suggest that the changing genotypes of the organisms with which an individual interacts are the major source of this biotic uncertainty; that, once evolved, sex in one population may lead to the contagious spread and persistence of sex in a community of highly interacting individuals.","0003-0147

",,,,"MODERN biogeographic theory states that the number of species in a class or other large taxonomic unit that inhabits an island is maintained within narrow bounds by a dynamic steady state between colonization and extinction' (MacArthur and Wilson 1967). Although a recent experimental test of the theory upheld most of its expectations (Simberloff and Wilson 1969), there remains a paucity of data on natural colonization and extinction rates from which to judge the time scale of faunal turnover on islands of varying geographic status. Two previous studies of avifaunal turnover on islands have come to our attention, one involving the California Channel Islands (Diamond 1969) and the other, Karkar, a volcanic island off the north coast of New Guinea (Diamond 1971c). Here we report on changes in the birdlife of Mona Island that have transpired since the turn of the century. Mona is especially well suited for the measurement of turnover for a number of reasons: its terrestrial avifauna consists of a very limited number of species, most of which are common; its topography and vegetation are extremely uniform, making unlikely the possibility that species have escaped detection in small pockets of habitat; it is large enough (24 square miles) to provide living space for numerically ample populations, yet small enough to cover on foot from end to end; it has suffered comparatively little disturbance by man; and its avifauna has been thoroughly surveyed on several prior occasions, first in 1901. In having a fauna that is entirely composed of species found on the nearby western end of Puerto Rico, Mona also lends itself to a study of ecological release, an expansion in density, distribution, or behavior that is commonly observed when the performance of a species is recorded under high and low intensities of competition (Crowell 1961, 1962; Willis 1966; Diamond 1969, 1971a, 1971b; MacArthur et al. 1972). The presence of a gradient of habitat in Puerto Rico that extends from areas of high to low rainfall makes it possible to select a plot having almost any desired combination of structural characteristics. By comparing the censuses of matched plots, one obtains good control over at least some of the variables that potentially regulate faunal composition and density.

",,,,"Aim To review and critically assess the evidence that the testate amoeba species Nebela vas does not have a cosmopolitan distribution, in contradiction to the paradigm of microbial distribution that ‘everything is everywhere’.

Location Terrestrial and wetland habitats world-wide.

Methods Relevant data were assembled on the morphology, ecology and global geographical distribution of N. vas from a comprehensive literature review of published original records. The data were collated, analysed and summarized. The roles of long-term and short-term agents of dispersal are discussed.

Results A clear and repeated pattern has been elucidated of a microbial species, with a distinctive and unmistakeable morphology, that inhabits acid, damp terrestrial and wetland habitats in the southern cool-temperate and sub-Antarctic zones – including similar high-altitude habitats in the Tropics. It is almost entirely confined to the Gondwanaland continents and Southern Hemisphere islands. It is definitively absent from Holarctic regions. It is proposed that the continental distribution of N. vas is a consequence of continental drift following its original speciation in the Mesozoic or earlier, whereas its distribution on sub-Antarctic islands (glaciated in the Pleistocene) has been effected by dispersal from South America by wind around the Southern Ocean.

Main conclusion Nebela vas is a proven instance of a microbial species that does not have a cosmopolitan distribution.","0305-0270

","Robbins, Robert; Opler, Paul",,,,,1997.0,,,69,82,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Butterflies are among the best-known insects•an estimated 90% of the world's species have scientific names. As a consequence, their biology has been extensively investigated (Vane-Wright and Ackery, 1984), and they are perhaps the best group of insects for examining patterns of terrestrial biotic diversity and distribution. Butterflies also have a favorable image with the general public. Hence, they are an excellent group for communicating information on science and conservation issues such as diversity. Perhaps the aspect of butterfly diversity that has received the most attention over the last century is the striking difference in species richness between tropical and temperate regions. For example, Bates (1875) wrote that it would convey some idea of the diversity of butterflies (in the neighborhood of Belem, a town near the mouth of the Amazon River) when he mentioned that about 700 species are found within a hour's walk of the town, whereas the total number found in the British Islands does not exceed 66, and the whole of Europe supports only 321. This early comparison of tropical and temperate butterfly richness has been well confirmed (e.g., Owen, 1971; Scriber, 1973). A general theory of diversity would have to predict not only this difference between temperate and tropical zones, but also patterns within each region, and how these patterns vary among different animal and plant groups. However, for butterflies, variation of species richness within temperate or tropical regions, rather than between them, is poorly understood. Indeed, comparisons of numbers ofspecies among the Amazon basin, tropical Asia, and Africa are still mostly ""personal communication"" citations, even for vertebrates (Gentry, 1988a). In other words, unlike comparisons between temperate and tropical areas, these patterns are still in the documentation phase. In documenting geographical variation in butterfly diversity, we make some arbitrary, but practical decisions. Diversity, number of species, and species richness are used synonymously; we know little about the evenness of butterfly relative abundances. The New World fauna makes up the preponderance of examples because we are most familiar with these species. By focusing on them, we hope to minimize the errors generated by imperfect and incomplete taxonomy. Although what is and is not a butterfly is technically controversial.
The first three sections of this chapter summarize general patterns of butterfly diversity throughout the world, within the conterminous United States, and in the Neotropics, respectively. The fourth section points out, albeit preliminarily, how the distributions of butterflies•and presumably other insects• paint a different biogeographical picture of the world than the distributions of birds and mammals. Finally, we briefly discuss the significance of the observed patterns for conservation and for the study of diversity.",,,,,,,,,,,,No,,,,,,
108.0,"The linkage between riparian predators and aquatic insects across a stream‐resource spectrum
","Burdon, Francis; Harding, Jon",,Aquatic insect,,,2007.0,,,330,346,,,,,,53,2,"Freshwater Biology
",,"Wiley
",,,,"1. Spatial subsidies, defined as the flow of energy, nutrients, organisms or pollutants from one habitat to another, have been shown to affect the food–web dynamics in a wide range of ecosystems. An important subsidy to riparian communities is the contribution of adult stream insects to terrestrial predators such as birds, bats and lizards, but also invertebrates including ground and web-building spiders.

2. We surveyed 37 first- and second-order forest streams across differing environmental gradients in the Central South Island, New Zealand, to investigate the relationship between potential aquatic prey subsidies and predatory riparian arachnids. We anticipated that stream-insect biomass would be positively associated with riparian arachnids, as a result of emergent adult aquatic insect subsidies to the adjacent habitat.

3. We confirmed positive associations between stream-insect biomass as a predictor variable and riparian arachnid biomass (R2 = 0.42, F1,34 = 25.2, P < 0.001) and web densities (R2 = 0.45, F1,14 = 11.5, P < 0.01) respectively as dependent variables after adjusting for the confounding effects of environmental variables. Hierarchical partitioning confirmed the importance of stream insect biomass as a statistically significant contributor to the total explained variance in analyses calculated for arachnid biomass, abundance and web density.

4. A concurrent survey of spider-web density along 20-m transects from the stream edge into the forest indicated a strong decline in web-building spider density moving away from the stream (R2 = 0.41, F1,158 = 109, P < 0.001), with stream-insect biomass as a significant covariate (F1,149 = 17.7, P < 0.001).

5. Our results suggest that productivity gradients present in the donor system affect the magnitude of the interaction between adjacent habitats. Productivity gradients may lead to increased reciprocal subsidies through a positive feedback loop involving the predation of spiders and other predatory terrestrial invertebrates by aquatic predators. However, terrestrial insectivores such as birds, bats and lizards that are not readily used as prey by aquatic predators may circumvent the feedback cycle by consuming a large proportion of emergent aquatic-insect biomass. This may lead to asymmetry in the strength of food–web linkages between aquatic and terrestrial habitats.","0046-5070

In the northern Pacific region, bears Ursus spp. foraging on anadromous salmon Oncorhynchus spp. provide a key link between marine and terrestrial ecosystems, with salmon density, fish size and watershed size as potential predictors of the magnitude of marine subsidy to terrestrial habitats. We use nitrogen and carbon stable isotopes to provide an assessment of the patterns of marine-enrichment in riparian plants (11 species, 4 guilds) and litter invertebrates (4 guilds) sampled from 27 watersheds in coastal British Columbia, Canada. Watersheds occurred in three geographical regions (Vancouver Island, mainland midcoast and Haida Gwaii) and varied in size, and in biomass (kg m−1 of spawning length) and species of salmon (chum O. keta, pink O. gorbuscha and coho O. kisutch). δ15N values in all plant species and invertebrate guilds were positively predicted by total salmon biomass (kg m−1) and negatively predicted by watershed size. We observed replicated parallel slopes among plant species and invertebrate guilds across the gradient in salmon biomass, with differences in means hypothesized to be due to plant fractionation and animal trophic position. As such, we derived a watershed δ15N-index averaged across guilds, and using an information theoretic approach we find that the biomass of chum salmon is a much stronger predictor of the δ15N-index than either pink or coho salmon, or the sum biomass of all species. The top linear model contained chum biomass and watershed size. Chum salmon biomass independently predicted δ15N-index variation in all three regions of British Columbia. Chum salmon are larger than pink or coho and provide an energetic reward for bears that facilitates carcass transfer, tissue selective foraging, and nutrient distribution by insect scavengers. Analyses of biodiversity and habitat data across many watersheds moves towards a long-term goal in fisheries ecology to better integrate ecosystem values in salmon conservation.","0030-1299

",,,,"After nearly a decade of field inventories in which we preserved voucher specimens of the small terrestrial mammals of Sulawesi, we combined qualitative and quantitative analyses of morphological traits with molecular phylogenetics to better understand the diversity of shrews (Soricidae: Crocidura) on the island. We examined the morphology of 1368 specimens and obtained extensive molecular data from many of them, including mitochondrial DNA sequences from 851 specimens, up to five nuclear exons from 657 specimens, and thousands of ultraconserved elements from 90 specimens. By iteratively testing species limits using distinct character datasets and appropriate taxon sampling, we found clear, mostly consistent evidence for the existence of 21 species of shrews on Sulawesi, only seven of which were previously recognized. We divide these 21 species into five morphogroups, provide emended diagnoses of the seven previously named species, and describe 14 new species. The Long-Tailed Group contains Crocidura caudipilosa, C. elongata, C. microelongata, new species, and C. quasielongata, new species; the Rhoditis Group contains C. rhoditis, C. pseudorhoditis, new species, C. australis, new species, and C. pallida, new species; the Small-Bodied Group contains C. lea, C. levicula, C. baletei, new species, C. mediocris, new species, C. parva, new species, and C. tenebrosa, new species; the Thick-Tailed Group contains C. brevicauda, new species and C. caudicrassa, new species; and the Ordinary Group contains C. musseri, C. nigripes, C. normalis, new species, C. ordinaria, new species, and C. solita, new species. Documenting these endemic species reveals a local radiation (20 of the 21 species are members of an endemic clade) in which elevational gradients played a prominent role in either promoting speciation, or at a minimum, fostering the cooccurrence of phenotypically similar species. As now understood, the species-level diversity of Crocidura on Sulawesi is nearly three times the known diversity of any other insular shrew fauna. This study highlights the fact that if we wish to understand the true extent of biodiversity on Earth, large-scale, vouchered organismal inventories followed up with thorough examinations of genetic, morphological, and geographic traits are sorely needed in montane tropical regions, even for purportedly well-studied groups such as mammals.

",,,,"Cyanobacteria are among the most diverse morphological microorganisms that inhabit a great variety of habitats. Their presence in the Azores, a volcanic archipelago of nine islands in the middle of the North Atlantic Ocean, has already been reported. However, due to the high diversity of cyanobacteria habitats, their biodiversity is still understudied, mainly in extreme environments. To address this, a total of 156 cyanobacteria strains from Azores lakes, streams, thermal and terrestrial habitats were isolated. Identification was made based on a polyphasic approach using classical taxonomy (morphological characteristics and environmental data) and phylogeny among 81 strains assessed by maximum likelihood and Bayesian analysis of 16S rDNA partial sequences. The 156 isolates showed a high genera diversity (38) belonging to the orders Chroococcales, Nostocales, Oscillatoriales, and Synechococcales. Eleven new genera for the Azores habitats are here reported, reinforcing that cyanobacteria biodiversity in these islands is still much understudied. Phylogenetic analysis showed 14 clusters associated with these cyanobacteria orders, with evidence for six new genera and valuable information towards Microchaete/Coleospermum taxonomic revision that better reflects species environmental distribution. These results emphasize the need for cyanobacteria taxonomy revisions, through polyphasic studies, mainly in Synechococcales order and in the Microchaete/Coleospermum, Nostoc, and Anabaena genera.

",,,,"Compared to the striking diversification and levels of endemism observed in many terrestrial groups within the Hawaiian Archipelago, marine invertebrates exhibit remarkably lower rates of endemism and diversification. Supralittoral invertebrates restricted to specific coastal patchy habitats, however, have the potential for high levels of allopatric diversification. This is the case of Ligia isopods endemic to the Hawaiian Archipelago, which most likely arose from a rocky supralittoral ancestor that colonized the archipelago via rafting, and diversified into rocky supralittoral and inland lineages. A previous study on populations of this isopod from Oʻahu and Kauaʻi revealed high levels of allopatric differentiation, and suggested inter-island historical dispersal events have been rare. To gain a better understanding on the diversity and evolution of this group, we expanded prior phylogeographic work by incorporating populations from unsampled main Hawaiian Islands (Maui, Molokaʻi, Lanaʻi, and Hawaiʻi), increasing the number of gene markers (four mitochondrial and two nuclear genes), and conducting Maximum likelihood and Bayesian phylogenetic analyses. Our study revealed new lineages and expanded the distribution range of several lineages. The phylogeographic patterns of Ligia in the study area are complex, with Hawaiʻi, Oʻahu, and the Maui-Nui islands sharing major lineages, implying multiple inter-island historical dispersal events. In contrast, the oldest and most geographically distant of the major islands (Kauaʻi) shares no lineages with the other islands. Our results did not support the monophyly of all the supralittoral lineages (currently grouped into L. hawaiensis), or the monophyly of the terrestrial lineages (currently grouped into L. perkinsi), implying more than one evolutionary transition between coastal and inland forms. Geometric-morphometric analyses of three supralittoral clades revealed significant body shape differences among them. A taxonomic revision of Hawaiian Ligia is warranted. Our results are relevant for the protection of biodiversity found in an environment subject to high pressure from disturbances.

Second, we found a positive relationship between the size of the largest member of an island snake assemblage and island area and a negative relationship between the size of the smallest member of an island snake assemblage and island area. Best-fit lines through these data cross at a point corresponding to 1.0 m in body length, the presumed optimal size for a one-species island. Third, mainland snake species smaller than 1.0 m become larger on islands whereas those larger than 1.0 m become smaller on islands. The observation that all three analyses converge on a common body size is concordant with patterns observed in mammals and partial analyses of four other disparate animal clades. Because snakes differ so strikingly from mammals (ectotherms, gape-limited predators, elongate body shape) the concordant patterns of these two groups provide strong evidence for the evolution of an optimal body size within independent monophyletic groups. However, snakes differ from other taxonomic groups that have been studied in exhibiting a body size distribution that is not obviously skewed in either direction. We suggest that idiosyncratic features of the natural history of ectotherms allow relatively unconstrained distributions of body size whereas physiological limitations of endotherms constrain distributions of body size to a right skew.

",,,,"New Zealand, an archipelago of more than 2000 islands, has a terrestrial fauna especially depauperate in native land mammals. Kiore (Rattus exulans) was the first of four rodent species introduced by people. A project to eradicate invasive rats from Kapiti Island in 1996, represented a turning point in the technology, complexity and scale at which managers of natural heritage on New Zealand islands could operate. This paper includes case studies of some significant projects targeting rodents, sometimes with other introduced mammals, undertaken in the 12 years following Kapiti. Details of the methods, costs, results and outcomes are provided for Kapiti, Whenua Hou, Tuhua, Campbell, Raoul, Hauturu, Taukihepa, and Pomona islands, collectively representing a total of over 23,000 ha of habitat cleared of introduced mammals. Research and trials undertaken in the Kapiti project provided the basis for future environmental risk assessments, allowing other projects to focus on knowledge gaps. New trends in invasive species eradication in New Zealand include more challenging multi-species eradication projects, some of which are undertaken by self- funded community groups. To summarise the lessons of the New Zealand experience: a programmatic approach is recommended which will fit each eradication within a context or framework of goals for those islands; address biosecurity issues at the outset; build capability to attempt the most challenging and rewarding projects; facilitate investment in monitoring and manage expectations of stakeholders to ensure their ongoing support. Success breeds success but is never guaranteed.

",,,,"Abstract Little is known about the aerial transport of microbes, plants and animals into and between Antarctic terrestrial and freshwater habitats. Isolation by the circumpolar Southern Ocean restricts propagules to three main groups: 1) those capable of prolonged survival in the air, 2) those carried by animal vectors, especially Man, and 3) those of marine origin. Diverse ice-free areas available for colonization include: isolated islands with receding ice sheets (e.g., Signy Island), maritime geothermal areas (e.g., Deception Island), and high altitude gcothermal areas on continental volcanoes (e.g., Mt. Erebus). Propagule abundance and diversity are low in Antarctica. Chance affects colonization success because the potential and viability of a propagule must match a favourable habitat for settlement, with adequate time for establishment before conditions become unfavourable. Aerobiological studies of the whole Antarctic region require international co-operation. The Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research (SCAR) Biological Investigations of Terrestrial Antarctic Systems (BIOTAS) research network has identified aerobiology as a major component of its International Research Programme. Aerobiology will be ground-, ship- and aircraft-based. To meet the requirements of an intrinsically sparse, diverse Antarctic aerobiota, the British Antarctic Survey is developing a new particle sampler for remote field use.

Each species illustrated marked zonation such that they formed a distinct sequence from the subtidal across the wide intertidal zone to the supra-littoral. In addition to shore height zonation, there was distinct variation in type and range of habitat preferences. Of the 5 study islands, Quirimba and Quisiva had the greatest intertidal habitat variety and the largest number of resident hermit crab species. The number of hermit crab species peaked at 10 in the lower-shore zone and decreased upshore to 3 supra-littoral species and downshore to 8 subtidal species. In contrast, the density of hermit crab individuals peaked in the upper mid-shore, at 3 m-2. The mid-shore zone was also the primary region of cluster formation, principally involving Clibanarius laevimanus and Clibanarius virescens, although 3 other species were also involved. The activity of the 2 semi-terrestrial species, Coenobita rugosus and Coenobita cavipes, on Quirimba Island was principally related to the light:dark cycle but was strikingly different between open and mangrove habitats. Some degree of activity took place in both species throughout a 24 h period in the mangrove habitat, where the peak of feeding activity was twice that of the open sand-scrub habitat. Wind strength was a major influence on the activity of C. rugosus and C. cavipes, reducing the number of active individuals to zero at higher wind speeds, even in thinly mangroved habitats.

",,,,"Mammals comprise the bulk of the diet of free-ranging domestic cats Felis catus (defined as including outdoor pet cats, strays, and feral cats) in most parts of their global range. In Australia, predation by introduced feral cats has been implicated in the extinction of many mammal species, and in the ongoing decline of many extant species.

Here, we collate a wide range of records of predation by cats (including feral and pet cats) on Australian mammals and model traits of extant, terrestrial, native mammal species associated with the relative likelihood of cat predation. We explicitly seek to overcome biases in such a continental-scale compilation by excluding possible carrion records for larger species and accounting for differences in the distribution and abundance of potential prey species, as well as study effort, throughout each species’ range.

For non-volant species, the relative likelihood of predation by cats was greatest for species in an intermediate weight range (peaking at ca. 400 g), in lower rainfall areas and not dwelling in rocky habitats. Previous studies have shown the greatest rates of decline and extinction in Australian mammals to be associated with these traits. As such, we provide the first continental-scale link between mammal decline and cat predation through quantitative analysis.

Our compilation of cat predation records for most extant, terrestrial, native mammal species (151 species, or 52% of the Australian species’ complement) is substantially greater than previously reported (88 species) and includes 50 species listed as threatened by the IUCN or under Australian legislation (57% of Australia's 87 threatened terrestrial mammal species). We identify the Australian mammal species most likely to be threatened by predation by cats (mulgaras Dasycercus spp., kowari Dasyuroides byrnei, many smaller dasyurids and medium-sized to large rodents, among others) and hence most likely to benefit from enhanced mitigation of cat impacts, such as translocations to predator-free islands, the establishment of predator-proof fenced exclosures, and broad-scale cat poison baiting.","0305-1838

",,"Wiley
",,,,"In recent decades the grass Phragmites australis has been aggressively invading coastal, tidal marshes of North America, and in many areas it is now considered a nuisance species. While P. australis has historically been restricted to the relatively benign upper border of brackish and salt marshes, it has been expanding seaward into more physiologically stressful regions. Here we test a leading hypothesis that the spread of P. australis is due to anthropogenic modification of coastal marshes. We did a field experiment along natural borders between stands of P. australis and the other dominant grasses and rushes (i.e., matrix vegetation) in a brackish marsh in Rhode Island, USA. We applied a pulse disturbance in one year by removing or not removing neighboring matrix vegetation and adding three levels of nutrients (specifically nitrogen) in a factorial design, and then we monitored the aboveground performance of P. australis and the matrix vegetation. Both disturbances increased the density, height, and biomass of shoots of P. australis, and the effects of fertilization were more pronounced where matrix vegetation was removed. Clearing competing matrix vegetation also increased the distance that shoots expanded and their reproductive output, both indicators of the potential for P. australis to spread within and among local marshes. In contrast, the biomass of the matrix vegetation decreased with increasing severity of disturbance. Disturbance increased the total aboveground production of plants in the marsh as matrix vegetation was displaced by P. australis. A greenhouse experiment showed that, with increasing nutrient levels, P. australis allocates proportionally more of its biomass to aboveground structures used for spread than to belowground structures used for nutrient acquisition. Therefore, disturbances that enrich nutrients or remove competitors promote the spread of P. australis by reducing belowground competition for nutrients between P. australis and the matrix vegetation, thus allowing P. australis, the largest plant in the marsh, to expand and displace the matrix vegetation. Reducing nutrient load and maintaining buffers of matrix vegetation along the terrestrial–marsh ecotone will, therefore, be important methods of control for this nuisance species.","1051-0761

",,,,,,"Abstract The Newell's shearwater, or ‘A’o Puffinus newelli, is endemic to the main islands of the Hawaiian Archipelago and is listed as endangered on the International Union for Conservation of Nature Red List and as threatened under the U.S. Endangered Species Act. Using abiotic and biotic environmental variables, we developed a terrestrial habitat suitability model for this species on Kauai to predict habitat that could be suitable in the absence of anthropogenic threats. In addition, we developed a habitat/threat-isolation index incorporating information from our suitability model to identify regions of structurally suitable habitat with less exposure to certain anthropogenic threats (relative to other portions of the island). The habitat suitability model suggests that slope, density of rock fragments within the soil, and native vegetation cover are important factors associated with the current known distribution of the Newell's shearwater on Kauai, and that a moderate portion of the sloped interior terrain of Kauai could potentially be suitable nesting habitat for this species. The habitat/threat-isolation index identified the mountains on the north-central portion of the island as structurally suitable habitat most isolated from a combination of major anthropogenic disturbances (relative to other portions of the island). Much of this region, however, is privately owned and not designated as an official reserve, which could indicate a need for increased conservation action in this region in the future. This information is important for conservation biologists and private landowners because expanding efforts to control nonnative predators, as well as management of additional lands as reserves, may be necessary for the protection and preservation of the Newell's shearwater.

",,"Springer Nature
",,,,"The small archipelago of Tl'chés, in coastal British Columbia, has gone through drastic social-ecological change culminating in the decline of traditional management practices, invasion of exotic plant species and, in the early 1960s, land abandonment. This is a common trend in cultural landscapes around the world. Cultural landscapes have great social-ecological significance, including cultural safeguarding and renewal, as well as maintenance of biodiversity, ecosystem functions and services, making them objects of special attention in conservation and restoration efforts. This study investigates the relationship between the Lekwungen people and heavily altered ecosystems in the context of ecological restoration for the cultural landscapes of Tl'chés. In order to thoroughly explore the ecological, social and cultural aspects and processes involved in the restoration of Tl'chés, this study combined different environmental sciences methodologies, including historical and archival research, semi-structured interviews and participatory observation with Lekwungen participants, as well as ecological field assessments and an innovative mapping approach termed Terrestrial Cultural Ecosystem Mapping (TCEM). This study generated historical and spatial references for ecosystem and land use change in West Chatham Island, as well as cultural and ecological understandings to support restoration. Although important native species such as Camassia spp. are still thriving, present-day ecosystems on this island are heavily altered from the natural Garry oak ecosystem reference sites and are largely dominated by exotic invasive shrubs and graminoid species. This investigation indicates that the Lekwungen value both the historical ecological conditions of the island and particular types of the present-day novel or hybrid ecological states, such as the overgrown heritage orchard and nonnative berries found on the islands. Present-day ecosystems of Tl'chés are a result of a hybrid management system (traditional and conventional), coupled with land abandonment for many decades. Restoration of Tl'chés must involve both ecological and cultural components. Therefore, intervention strategies should consider the incorporation of novel and hybrid ecosystems (i.e. naturalized exotic species) into a restoration plan for ecological, cultural, historical, and subsistence values.

In the present study, we conducted a 7-month survey within a 5-km stretch in the urbanised Attanagalu-Oya river area to study habitat associations, mesohabitat use and behaviour of V. salvator in urban landscapes. The greatest number of monitor sightings was made in aquatic habitats, followed by terrestrial and arboreal habitats within the riparian zone. Sightings of different life history stages of V. salvator across major habitat types varied significantly. The adults and subadults associated mostly with aquatic and terrestrial habitats, whereas hatchlings and juveniles associated mostly with aquatic and arboreal habitats. Given variable sighting frequencies of distinct life history stages across different major habitat types, it is likely that there is substantial age-structured niche partitioning in V. salvator. The urban population of V. salvator studied seemed to be fairly abundant, and resilient to anthropogenic stressors and adversity of urbanisation. In species-depauperate urban environments, ecosystem functions provisioned by V. salvator as generalist predators as well as scavengers are arguably significant and deserve further investigation. No direct anthropogenic threats were observed during the study.","1323-1650

Marine populations are typically open, and local production may have little impact on local recruitment, such that long-distance dispersal is an important determinant of population ecology. Since oceanic islands form discrete patches of habitat surrounded by a structurally different environment, we tested the general hypothesis that processes operating at the scale of islands have a greater influence on these populations than the processes operating at smaller, intra-island scales. A hierarchical design examined the patterns of abundance and distribution of conspicuous taxa at 3 tidal heights at a range of spatial scales, ranging from a few meters to hundreds of kilometres apart in the rocky intertidal of the Azores. Both uni- and multivariate analyses showed that at the largest scale (islands), significant variation was detected in the lower and mid-shore communities, but not on the upper shore. Along the vertical gradient of immersion there was a trend for increasing small-scale patchiness towards the top of the shore. The potential role of local environmental stress gradients and broad-scale oceanographic patterns of recruitment in structuring these assemblages is discussed. This study corroborates the suitability of the analytical tools used here to examine patterns of distribution over a range of spatial scales and its applicability in the field of island marine ecology.

",,,,"We describe the nest-site characteristics and breeding habitat use of Kelp Geese (Chloephaga hybrida) and Flightless Steamer-Ducks (Tachyeres pteneres) along 137 km of coastline on the northern shore of the Beagle Channel, Argentina, and 87 km of island coastline. We examined the importance of vegetation cover, predation, and tourism on the distribution of nests among islands. We found all nests only on islands and islets. Nesting sites for both species were strongly associated with higher proportions of high vegetation cover (shrubs). Kelp Geese were also associated with the absence of terrestrial predators. Tourist presence on islands was not associated with the occurrence of nests for either species. The northern coasts of the Beagle Channel and the islands and islets along the channel have similar habitat types. However, the islands and islets are relatively inaccessible to mammalian terrestrial predators compared to the coast of the channel where terrestrial predators are frequently recorded. Therefore, islands and islets seem to provide a relatively safe nesting habitat for Kelp Geese and Flightless Steamer-Ducks by offering refuge mainly from ground predators. Additionally, habitat changes caused by increased human disturbance along the northern shore of the Beagle Channel may also explain the presence of nests only on islands and islets, though further studies are needed to assess these effects. This study contributes new information on the breeding habitat and nesting sites of Flightless Steamer-Ducks and Kelp Geese in the Beagle Channel, to assist in the identification of priority breeding sites and habitats to protect. Also, it highlights the importance of islands and islets of the Beagle Channel as safe breeding refuge for these two ground nesting seabirds.

",,,,"The vulnerability of less developed regions is exacerbated by a lack of information to inform appropriate adaptation planning. We addressed this challenge in the islands of Lombok and Sumbawa (Nusa Tenggara Barat Province, Indonesia) by combining multiple sources of knowledge to develop a typology of natural resource use by communities of the province. This enabled an assessment of future impacts of drivers of change such as population growth and climate change. The typology was developed by cluster analysis of an inventory of the use of ecosystem goods and services (EGS) by the 105 rural subdistricts in the province. The data were largely elicited from expert knowledge, augmented by a rapid rural appraisal of communities' marine resource use in Sumbawa. Exploratory analysis of existing secondary data on livelihoods and land use provided context and skeleton data, which were developed further by experts. Overall, 82 EGS were identified from nine terrestrial, coastal, marine and freshwater habitats. EGS included livestock, cropping, forestry, wildlife hunting, fishing, aquaculture, mining, water (for drinking and agriculture) and tourism. The typology comprised seven types that captured 42% of the variation in the data matrix. The types were moderately spatially aggregated and showed some congruence with administrative (district) boundaries. We discuss the implications of the results for planning livelihood adaptation strategies, and out-scaling these among subdistricts of matching types.

Questions
Abandonment of anthropogenic ecosystems threatens biodiversity in rural areas globally. Successional responses in anthropogenic ecosystems have been shown to differ from those in natural ecosystems because of the legacy of continuous management activities. However, few studies have focused on successional changes in anthropogenic freshwater ecosystems following abandonment. Focusing on two drivers (water depletion and cessation of anthropogenic disturbance), we tested whether water depletion plays a larger role than years since abandonment in determining the both plant functional diversity and composition in farm ponds.

Location
Awaji Island, western Japan.

Methods
We investigated flora at 200 farm ponds, which had experienced long-term continuous anthropogenic disturbance. We interviewed 100 managers of the surveyed ponds and local farmers to identify the ponds’ management status. To capture community processes during succession, we focused on functional richness and functional trait composition. We assessed the relative contribution of the two successional drivers in determining functional richness by adopting a linear model. We classified the survey ponds into five groups based on the two successional drivers and performed PERMANOVA to test differences in functional composition among the groups.

Results
Water depletion played a larger role than elapsed time since cessation of anthropogenic disturbance in determining functional richness. Functional composition of water-depleted ponds significantly differed from that of managed ponds, regardless of years since abandonment.

Conclusions
Our results indicate that water depletion has a larger effect on successional changes in ponds than cessation of anthropogenic disturbance; that is, water depletion drives succession and overrides the legacy of continuous anthropogenic disturbance. The results suggest that, in freshwater ecosystems, the functional change in a community is greater in the transition from macrophytes to terrestrial plants than it is in the transition from stress-tolerant species to competitive species.","1402-2001

We provide an updated and detailed checklist and distribution of bird groups for all islands individually from a sampling period of 2015–2022. A total of 96 bird species belonging to 34 families from 13 orders were recorded from all the islands; of which 58 species were waterbirds and other terrestrial ones. Of the 29 shorebird species recorded, one is Endangered and seven are Near Threatened by IUCN Red List. Some of the earlier recorded species, not seen in our survey, are not annotated as no record exists for the last decade.

Because larger crabs and gastropods are known to deposit more eggs than smaller conspecifics, these data confirmed to resource owners the value of prohibiting harvesting from regions to improve productivity of adjacent harvested regions.

",,,,"Located on the eastern margin of Eurasia, the Japanese Archipelago hosts a unique modern fauna of terrestrial vertebrates including landbirds which show a high proportion of endemic species/subspecies.Despite its potential importance in taxonomy and biogeography, the Pleistocene landbird fossil record has been scarce on Japanese islands, providing little information on the history of the unique fauna in the region.In this study, fossil remains of non-passeriform landbirds from the middle-late Pleistocene (Marine Isotope Stages [MIS] 9 and 5e) of Shiriya, northernmost Honshu Island, Japan, are revised with extensive osteological comparisons.As a result, the presence of at least six non-passeriform landbird species, represented by 71 specimens, was confirmed: Syrmaticus sp., Coturnicini gen.et sp.indet., Columbidae gen.et sp.indet., Apus sp., Haliaeetus sp., and Accipitridae gen.et sp.indet.The Shiriya paleoavifauna is the first substantial Pleistocene landbird fauna reported from the central Japanese islands so far, and suggests that the overall landbird fauna in northern Honshu in the last interglacial period (MIS 5e) was not drastically different from the present one, in contrast to the presence of several extinct land mammals and seabirds in the local fauna.The occurrence of Syrmaticus despite the supposedly colder climate in that time than today suggests that the distribution of modern S. soemmerringii might not be totally defined by climatic factors, but probably affected by a biogeographic barrier at the strait between Honshu and Hokkaido islands.

",,,,"We describe a new taxon of terrestrial bird of the genus Aphrastura (rayaditos) inhabiting the Diego Ramírez Archipelago, the southernmost point of the American continent. This archipelago is geographically isolated and lacks terrestrial mammalian predators as well as woody plants, providing a contrasted habitat to the forests inhabited by the other two Aphrastura spp. Individuals of Diego Ramírez differ morphologically from Aphrastura spinicauda, the taxonomic group they were originally attributed to, by their larger beaks, longer tarsi, shorter tails, and larger body mass. These birds move at shorter distances from ground level, and instead of nesting in cavities in trees, they breed in cavities in the ground, reflecting different life-histories. Both taxa are genetically differentiated based on mitochondrial and autosomal markers, with no evidence of current gene flow. Although further research is required to define how far divergence has proceeded along the speciation continuum, we propose A. subantarctica as a new taxonomic unit, given its unique morphological, genetic, and behavioral attributes in a non-forested habitat. The discovery of this endemic passerine highlights the need to monitor and conserve this still-pristine archipelago devoid of exotic species, which is now protected by the recently created Diego Ramírez Islands-Drake Passage Marine Park.

",,,,"We describe a new species of Rattus , from 3 modern specimens collected on Manus Island in the Admiralty Group, Papua New Guinea, between 2002 and 2012. Subfossil specimens of early to late Holocene age from the Pamwak archaeological site on Manus Island are referred to the new species on morphological criteria; these confirm the species as a long-term resident of Manus Island. The new species is distinguished by its combination of large size; short tail; dorsal pelage that is coarse, spiny, and dark, with prominent black guard hairs; and sharply contrasting cream ventral pelage. Based on its overall body form, the species is almost certainly terrestrial. The dentition combines robust incisors with relatively small molars and the cranium displays a distinctive mélange of characters—including an elongate and anteriorly expanded rostrum and a mesopterygoid fossa that is narrow anteriorly and broadens to the rear. Sequence data from the mitochondrial control region and 3 nuclear genes place the new species as a highly divergent member of the Australo–Papuan Rattus radiation, with no identified close relative among sampled taxa. Morphological comparisons are made between the new species and other pertinent species of Rattus from the region, including R. sanila , a species known only from Late Pleistocene fossil to Late Holocene subfossil remains from an archaeological site on New Ireland. The conservation status of the new species is discussed in the light of a recent survey that failed to locate surviving populations in 2 areas of natural forest on Manus Island. Further survey work is urgently needed to identify any surviving populations and to assess the role of potential threats to the species.

",,,,"Conservation of the endangered yellow-eyed penguin (Megadyptes antipodes) in New Zealand has principally sought to manage terrestrial threats, while relatively little has been done to understand or address marine threats, such as reduced prey availability, commercial fisheries interactions, and habitat destruction. We assessed spatial similarities between mainland yellow-eyed penguin marine distribution and resources (prey), risks (fisheries interactions), and areas of refugia (marine protected areas, MPAs). We determined if suitable penguin foraging habitat, based on environmental predictors using a Maxent species distribution model (SDM), also supports a high diversity of key prey species identified using a stacked SDM. We also created a novel index to predict areas of potential commercial fisheries interactions and mapped the overlap of penguin distribution and MPAs. Areas along the middle of the continental shelf had the highest prey diversity and probability of penguin presence, which overlapped with gillnet fisheries in these regions. Suitable penguin habitat also overlaps with trawl fisheries inshore along much of the South Island coast. <1 % of the penguin range overlaps with current MPAs, and the proposed South-East Marine Protected Areas network would protect only 3.6 % of the current penguin foraging distribution. This study takes an ecosystem approach to assess complex interactions between commercial fisheries, marine ecosystems, and MPAs, which is urgently required for marine spatial planning and adaptive ecosystem management of not only this endangered seabird but for southeast New Zealand coastal habitat and biota also.

",,,,"The papers published in this issue of Biology and Environment are derived from keynote presen tationsmade during the 5th Flora and Fauna of Atlantic Islands symposium held in University College Dublin from the 24th to the 27th August 2004. One hundred delegates encompassing twenty nationalities and sixteen islandnations attended this symposium with presentations based on research on islands from as far apart as Svalbard, within the Arctic Circle to thenorth and the Falkland Islands, close to theArctic Circle in the south.This seriesof symposia developed from the recognition by researchers on Macronesian Islands of the need to understand and preserve the unique ecosystems associated with many isolatedAtlantic islands.The previous four symposiawere held inMadeira, the Canary Islands, theAzores and Cape Verde. The fifthsymposium (FFAIS-5) was thefirstto be held on an Atlantic island outside the four Macronesian archipelagos, and one aim of FFAIS-5 was to foster a greater exchange of findingsfrom a broader range ofAtlantic Islands and countries. One of the arguments for a broad focus on islands and island ecosystems is that common factors thatmay be independent of geographical con siderations are likely to have shaped many of the features of island flora and fauna, isolation being one of the primary factors. However, even closely associated islands can have a strikinglydifferent biota, as the classic example ofDarwin's finches on theGalapagos Island's has so clearly demonstrated. The uniqueness of island ecosystems is likely to be due to a hotch potch of features, where closeness to the mainland is important, as are historically related factors and the extent of human interference. As a consequence of their isolation, islands have provided, and will continue to provide, important information on evolutionary processes, genetic differentiation, adaptation and biodiversity. However, the impact of change on islands may be subtly distinct from the same forces operating on larger land masses. While island ecosystems and biota are very attractive for tourism (ecotourism), they are often vulnerable and theirexploitation for educational or financial reasons requires closer consideration of the environmental impact of any such developments. Invasions by animals and plants have clearly had a major impact on island biodiversity, and with increased trade and greater accessibility this situation is likely to worsen. Of importance is the implementation of the appropriate legislation and the political will to ensure that these issues?issues that pay little heed to geopolitical borders?are dealt with adequately. In the accompanying articles a number of these issues are addressed, covering marine, terrestrial and freshwater environments associated with Atlantic Islands. In two introductoryaccounts,Alan Craig and John Faulkner outline the policies and achieve ments associated with cross-border biodiversity issues in Ireland, recognising the importance of an all-island approach. Eric Hoyt discusses aspects of ecotourism as it relates to whale watching and argues for the creation of speciallyprotectedmarine areas as a way of ensuring the protection of organisms from the major impacts of tourist activities. Some of the intriguing aspects of island ecosystems in the arctic are covered by Ingibjorg Jonsdottir, while the significance of a strongly oceanic climate on plant distribution isdiscussed by Bob Crawford. Classic studies of plant speciation on islands and their significance for adaptation is a theme covered by Richard Abbot. While the importance of appropriate legislation is emphasised in relation to the application of the EU Water Framework Directive to Atlantic islands by Samantha Hughes, legislation alone is unlikely towork in controlling the introduction of invasive plants. Max Wade argues that more consideration should be given to the identification and monitoring of likely invaders. Papers submitted from the general scientific sessions of FFAIS-5, togetherwith abstractsof the keynote presentations, are published as an Occa sional Publication of the Irish Biogeographical Society. And what of the future for islands ecosystems and biota? Like mainland areas, islands face increasing pressures associated with climate/ environmental change. How island ecosystems will respond is unclear. Recent climate change predictions for islands show considerable uncertainty (Jenkins et al. (2003).","0791-7945

",,,,"Habits and consequences of pesticide use in pepper plantations were studied in Indonesia. The first study was conducted by questioning 117 farmers about their habits in pesticide use and determining pesticide residues on pepper berries on Bangka Island. Meanwhile, the second study was completed by analyzing exposure levels of pesticide in farmers' bodies before and after pesticide application to pepper plantations at Sukamulya, West Java. Risks of pesticide exposure to below ground terrestrial invertebrates and aquatic ecosystems adjacent to the treated fields were evaluated using scenarios and a decision support system. Results showed that five respondents (4.3%) were agricultural workers without their own plantations and the others were plantation owners. About 112 respondents (95.7%) used pesticides regularly, while 21 respondents (17.9%) had experienced pesticide poisoning. About 54 respondents (46.2%) tended to apply the same pesticide on all occasions, and 104 respondents (88.9%) indicated to always apply a single compound. About 91 respondents (77.8%) were not aware of the possible impact of pesticides on their health, and 102 respondents (87.2%) were not aware of the possible effects on the environment. In addition while spraying pesticides 17 respondents (14.5%) were smoking, 81 respondents (69.2%) were wearing daily clothes, and 84 respondents (71.8%) were throwing empty bottles into the forest. Exposure study revealed that the residues in the urine and blood increased 6.5–10 and 1.1–1.5 folds, respectively indicating actual and direct exposures. The environmental risk assessment indicated low risks for the terrestrial below ground invertebrates but high potential risks for the aquatic ecosystem. The residues of the major pesticides were below the maximum residue limits. This study indicated that the farmers and their workers, and probably also the environment, were at risk of high exposure to the pesticides applied, but that the risks for the consumers were negligible, if present at all. © 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

",,,,"Vascular plants do not appear to experience mass extinctions (Willis & McElwain, 2002), and, as Traverse (1988) has stressed, 'Plant evolution dances to a different beat'. This may be because of the ecophysiological and reproductive plasticity of many groups of terrestrial plants, as well as of the high frequency with which alterations in embryo development become evolutionarily fixed. It is probable that some aspects of this model will have to be reconsidered in forthcoming years as progress is made in stratigraphic resolution and as we improve the quality of the fossil record (McElwain & Punyasena, 2007). Nevertheless, it is clear that regional extinction events have occurred in plants and that these were related to changes in biome distribution and floristic composition at a continental level (Willis & McElwain, 2002). As biotic responses to climatic change have not been the same in all regions, it is crucial to gather detailed information concerning how these phenomena have varied geographically and to what extent the sequence of bio-diversity loss has affected present-day floristic composition in different parts of the world. It is for this reason that we welcome the study by Postigo et al. (2009), which represents a monumental effort of nomenclatural screening, bibliographic scrutiny, and a broad conceptual consideration of the history of plants in the Iberian Peninsula and the Balearic Islands over the last 65 million years. This review of Cenozoic floras will be of particular use in international palaeontological and neontological contexts because most of the information sources discussed are difficult to find by means of conventional bibliographic and data-search protocols; for example, they include symposium proceedings, conference and unpublished reports, local journals and monographs, which are mostly in Spanish and Portuguese.Postigo et al. (2009) provide a critical review of the floristic composition and ecology of Palaeotropical and Arctotertiary taxa in Cenozoic forest communities and detail the extinctions of a number of families and genera in relation to climate change. Plants have often managed to escape abiotic stress through geographical redistribution, and the Mediterranean region has a number of examples illustrating this (Arroyo et al., 2008). The changes described in Postigo et al. (2009) demonstrate this phenomenon, and it is of particular note that Iberian floras have experienced long periods of persistence compared to floras in the rest of Europe. As Postigo et al. (2009) postulate, this can be reasonably explained using the concept of peninsular refugia (Carrión et al., 2008). However, it is also plausible that complex ecological interactions, including those derived from the enormous faunal diversity of Iberia during the Cenozoic, as well as phylogenetically structured mutualistic networks, provide an environment particularly favourable to climatic resilience. Looking at Postigo et al.'s (2009) database, several examples of the 'Lazarus effect' can be detected, that is, cases for which an apparently extinct taxon reappears in younger rocks. Among others, there are Phaleria and Carpodiptera across the Late Eocene–Early Oligocene interval; Gleicheniaceae and Podocarpus from the Palaeocene to the Oligocene; Chloranthaceae, Restionaceae, Nypa, Myrsinaceae, Simaourabaceae and Cycadaceae across the Palaeocene/Eocene up to the Miocene; Bombacaceae during the end of the Palaeogene; Menispermaceae, Hamamelis, Pittosporum and Celastrus from the Oligocene to the mid-Pliocene; and Engelhardia, Nyssa, Sciadopitys and Symplocos throughout their Palaeogene records. Even more thought-provoking is the possibility of a Signor–Lipps effect in several records. These are situations in which the last occurrences precede the true times of extinction (Taylor, 2004). For example, it may be that several taxa that disappeared during the Zanclean (5.3–3.6 Ma) (e.g. Ginkgo, Cyatheaceae, Clethraceae–Cyrillaceae, Andromeda) may actually have become extinct at the Piacenzian extinction horizon (3.6–2.5 Ma). It is also worth considering whether the significant decline during the middle Chattian, about 25 Ma, in fact corresponds to an Oligocene–Miocene boundary regional extinction. Poor sampling and gaps in the fossil record may have reduced the perceived severity of peninsular extinctions during particular events. Figure 1 summarizes the extinction record depicted by Postigo et al. (2009) (in their figure 4, and tables 1 and 2). The number of extinctions peaks during the Oligocene, with 41.88% of the total Cenozoic disappearances. Oligocene disappearances are even higher (47.84%) if we consider only genera. As Postigo et al. (2009) indicate, Miocene extinctions are also significant (27.44% of total taxa), although the Pliocene and Quaternary periods do not include high numbers of extinctions (10.47 and 8.66%, respectively). However, the situation is very different if we take into account extinction rates (Fig. 1): whereas the Oligocene has a large value (10.67 total taxa Ma−1), the Pliocene (8.22 taxa Ma−1) and Quaternary (13.29 taxa Ma−1) also have high rates of phytodiversity loss. More specifically, as seen from data shown in Postigo et al.'s figure 4, major biotic crises are indicated at the end of the Oligocene (c. 28–23 Ma), at the Piacenzian (3.6–2.5 Ma), and during the Lower–Mid Pleistocene transition (1.4–0.7 Ma). The last of these was probably associated with the beginning of the 100-kyr climatic cyclicity and a general cooling trend. Number of extinctions accumulated per geological period, and extinction rate (taxa Ma−1) of Iberian and Balearic vascular plants during the Cenozoic. Percentages in brackets. Data source: Postigo et al. (2009). Taken together, these new data open up exciting avenues for future research; for example, a quantitative study to compare the per taxon extinction, the extinction rates, and the per taxon extinction rates in the Iberian Peninsula with those of the rest of the European continent. This may allow clarification of the post-extinction diversification dynamics and biotic interchanges in plants of the region. Lineage extinction is also a promising topic of research, considering the phylogenetic relatedness between several groups of the taxa analysed. Equally interesting would be the capability to uncouple ecological and taxonomic impacts (McGhee et al., 2004) in each of the temporal extinction windows, although, in this case, it would be necessary to compare the data with the avian, terrestrial tetrapod and insect fossil records. The final aim would be to ascertain the level of collapse in the pre-existing ecosystem. Clearly, not all taxa in an ecosystem have the same importance. In the Iberian Peninsula, few will doubt that the selective removal of the Oligocene tropical group during the Chattian (28–23 Ma; including the Bombacaceae, Nyctaginaceae and Annonaceae); of Torreya at c. 7 Ma; and of the Arecaceae, Ebenaceae, Magnoliaceae and Sapindaceae during the Early Pliocene, c. 3 Ma, must have had a tremendous impact on the ecological structure of communities. This is especially true for those possessing megafauna dispersal-syndrome fruits (e.g. Icacinaceae, Passifloraceae, Annonaceae, Sapotaceae) (Guimarães et al., 2008). Finally, we should not forget that biodiversity losses not only result from high extinction rates, but may also result from a depression in the rate of species production, or from some combination of both processes.

",,,,"Domestic sheep have been introduced to numerous islands worldwide; they became feral and caused indiscriminate impacts on ecosystems. On Socorro, a tropical Mexican island in the Pacific Ocean, feral sheep caused soil compaction and erosion, loss of vegetation, habitat destruction, landscape alterations, and species extinction. In response to these biodiversity threats, feral sheep were removed from Socorro Island. In 2009, 1257 sheep were dispatched using aerial hunting over 35 hours of flight time. To locate remaining herds, twelve sheep were captured and equipped with radio-collars (Judas sheep). From March 2010 to April 2012 eradication continued using terrestrial hunting; 505 sheep were dispatched at this stage. The use of Judas sheep and detection dogs were critical in locating the last remaining sheep. A systematic monitoring program conducted during two years confirmed eradication success. In June 2014, Socorro Island was declared free of feral sheep. To date (November 2015), a remarkable ecosystem recovery has been recorded.","0378-1844

The majority of Liparocephalini are distributed along the coasts of the northern Pacific rim, some 9000 km away from B. chiltoni. Most are apterous, and with Baeostethus as a relatively derived member of the group, it is difficult to reconcile the biogeographic pattern based on a dispersal event from the northern Pacific to the Campbell Plateau. We argue that the trans‐Pacific pattern in Liparocephalini is due to an older contiguous distribution along the coastal margins of Pangea. The data are supported by an alternative area cladogram derived from a rerooted tree, congruence with a Pacific rim pattern seen in intertidal Aegalitinae (Salpingidae), and the distribution and phylogeny of terrestrial Gymnusini (Aleocharinae).

",,,,"The successful establishment of many plants in tropical forests often depends on species-specific adaptations related to light availability and forest successional stage. Species that are present in early successional stages generally do not occur in later successional stages. In this study, we documented the diversity, distribution, and abundance of terrestrial invasive plants across the (sub)tropical island of Hainan, China, and tested the germination of specific invasive plants in forested environments. In 97 transects positioned randomly across the island, we found nine invasive herb and shrub species were present in all human-modified habitats but not in intact forest interiors. In separate forest-specific transects, we documented a sharp drop in the abundance of invasive plants &gt;5 m into the forest. High numbers of invasive plant seeds germinated from the soil seed bank sampled at the forest edge, but very few seeds germinated from soil sampled any distance into the forest. Finally, in experiments with four focal invasive plant species, overall germination rates were low; and much lower in shaded sites compared to full gap sites. In conclusion, our findings demonstrated that invasive herbs and shrubs do not yet form a serious threat to native species in the closed-canopy forests of Hainan.

Someare specific in theirfood requirements, whileothers are generalists and opportunists, snatching up any insect within a certain size class. Needless to say. generalists are better island colonizers since the specialist may not find its favorite food item present on the island.

",,,,"Invasive species have caused substantial ecological and economic problems globally (Lowe, Browne, Boudjelas, & De Poorter, 2000). In the United States, the economic cost of non-indigenous species invasions is estimated to be between US$128 and US$147 billion annually (Pimentel, Zuniga, & Morrison, 2005), but the total cost is likely to be greater if ecosystem damage is also considered (Lovell, Stone, & Fernandez, 2006). Of this, economic losses from the effects of invasive fish in aquatic systems are believed to comprise US$1–5.7 billion annually (Pimentel et al., 2005). In New Zealand, a number of invasive fish species occur and are, in some places, particularly abundant. The acknowledged epicentre and only formally defined containment area for invasive koi carp (an ornamental strain of Cyprinus carpio) in New Zealand is located in the North Island in the Lower Waikato River Basin (LWRB; Grainger, 2015). Eutrophic conditions combined with a temperate climate and connected shallow riverine lakes and wetlands provide ideal conditions for the proliferation of this (Bajer et al., 2015; Vilizzi, Tarkan, & Copp, 2015) and other invasive fish such as the brown bullhead catfish Ameiurus nebulosus and goldfish Carassius auratus. In this paper, we describe an invasive fish management programme where unwanted organisms are removed from the aquatic habitat and converted into beneficial products to address or support environmental issues and initiatives related to conservation and/or restoration. The underlying closed loop philosophy of the programme is also to demonstrate core values of traceability and sustainability in the development, deployment and performance of these products. In particular, we discuss the importance of nutrient transfer between ecosystems, from aquatic organism capture through to uptake in terrestrial and coastal environments to illustrate the integrated framework within two case studies. The first study describes the use of processed invasive fish as a replacement for imported synthetic fertiliser tablets typically used in small-to-medium scale replanting programmes by restoration managers and community groups. For this case, we describe an experiment conducted across a regional dune restoration planting programme. The second is the use of invasive fish material as a lure in trapping programmes to control other introduced pests (e.g. introduced rats and mustelids) which have undesirable impacts on native terrestrial plant and animal taxa in New Zealand. Invasive fish for both these case studies were harvested at our invasive fish “demonstration site” using a fixed semi-automated fish cage (Figure 1). The fish cage is fitted with a customised mesh shape and size to minimise native fish by-catch while retaining the smallest invasive fish possible (David, 2015). Following euthanasia, fish are processed on site in a bacterial digester. Historically marine seabird nesting sites were abundant throughout coastal New Zealand dunes and the marine-derived nutrients that birds brought back to nesting sites were important for fuelling growth of native sand-binding dune plants (Hawke & Newman, 2007). These plant species have undergone substantial population declines, however, due to a range of human-induced stressors (Hawke & Newman, 2007). Nitrogen is now recognised to be the limiting nutrient for plants in these dune systems (Bergin & Kimberley, 1999) and planting programmes aimed at restoring dune plants generally use artificial fertiliser tablets to replace depleted nutrients and improve long-term plant survival and growth. A wide range of fertiliser tablets are available to consumers varying in nutrient and trace element composition, and different tablets are often used interchangeably by community groups in restoration planting programmes. However, tracing the source(s) of components used in artificial fertiliser manufacture, the majority of which are imported from overseas, can be a formidable challenge (Wood & Cowie, 2004). The production and distribution of artificial fertilisers, particularly those containing nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and potassium (K), are energy intensive (Bindraben, Dimpka, Nagarajan, Roy, & Rabbinge, 2015). Atmospheric N is typically synthesised into a useable form via the Haber–Bosch process, and the energy source used to drive the process (typically natural gas or gassified coal) results in emissions which purportedly vary considerably from 3.42 (EU) to 11.06 (China) kg CO2/kg N produced (Fertilisers Europe 2016, http://www.yara.dk/godning/miljo/reducing-carbon-footprint/fertilizer-life-cycle-perspective/life-cycle-analysis-of-ammonium-nitrate/). Phosphate on the other hand is typically mined from finite resources. Both processes generate considerable greenhouse gas emissions and other waste products (Wood & Cowie, 2004). Therefore, understanding the life cycle of components (footprint) used to assemble and produce an artificial tablet (that may subsequently be used in a restoration project) is in our view an important consideration. Recently proposed regulations for fertilisers by the European Commission to encourage use of recycled materials (e.g. biowaste) and to reduce, for example, soil accumulation of cadmium (an element commonly found in artificial fertiliser; Fertiliser Matters 2016) supports this perspective. Our proposed approach is a low footprint, locally produced recycling process where the infeed materials comprise predominantly unwanted organism protein (invasive fish) and other local recycled by-products (e.g. untreated sawdust, Figure 1). In terms of ecosystem energetics, fish provide a valuable nutrient recycling service in freshwater because these fish convert ingested material into biomass as they grow (Andersson, Granéli, & Stenson, 1988; Drenner, Day, Basham, Durward Smith, & Jensen, 1997). For instance, a study by Kitchell, Foonce, and Tennis (1975) calculated that up to 70% of phosphorus in the pelagic zone of Lake Wingra, USA, was embodied in fish biomass and that decomposition of dead post-spawned fish was likely to contribute substantially to the supply of phosphorus in lakes. Although carp also liberate nutrients during defecation and suctorial feeding (Morgan & Hicks, 2013), comparative phosphorus contributions from excretion of live fish are likely to be much lower (Andersson et al., 1988). The ability to remove this nutrient-rich biomass and reuse it elsewhere may be particularly beneficial to systems like the LWRB where substantial nutrient losses from intensive agriculture into water bodies have resulted in water quality declines driven predominantly by increases in total phosphorus and nitrate (Vant, 2008). In this case study, we compared the performance of recycled invasive fish fertiliser against artificial tablets for fuelling two species of dune plants—the New Zealand endemic sand-binding pingao Ficinia spiralis and native spinifex Spinifex sericeus. These species were planted in three coastal New Zealand dune systems to compare growth (plant spread and vigour) in response to nutrient additions at the time of planting (i.e. invasive fish and commercial fertiliser tablets vs. no fertiliser controls). The pelletised invasive fish had a lower nitrogen content than the tablets (Table S4), so to ensure comparability in trials, 72 g of fish pellets was equivalent to a 10 g commercial fertiliser tablet. Three dose rates were tested (1, 2 or 3 tablets, 72, 144 or 216 g pellets, Figure 2). More specific methodological and result details for this case study including experimental design, planting plot layouts and replication can be found in the supplementary information provided (Supplementary information 1, Figures S1 and S2). In summary, in most cases, invasive fish pellets produced a similar boost in plant growth and vigour to that achieved using commercial fertiliser pellets at all three sites and all fertilised plants grew significantly greater with respect to vigour and spread than no fertiliser controls (ANOVA, 0.05, Figures 3 and 4, Tables S1–S3, Figure S3). There was little additional growth at the medium- and high-dose rates for either fertiliser type suggesting that a single dose of either tablets or pellets is sufficient for growth performance while maintaining manageable field deployment logistics (material transport and application, Bergin & Bergin, 2016). Furthermore, stable isotope analysis of the nitrogen in dried dune plant material indicated clear uptake of nutrients into plant tissues from both pellets and tablets. Plants supplied with either fertiliser type (pellets or tablets) exhibited consistent but significantly different δ15N signatures, reflective of the origin and composition of the added nutrient source (Table 1). In effect, locally produced invasive fish pellets appear to be a viable and comparably performing alternative to imported artificial fertiliser tablets for dune restoration planting initiatives. In contrast to artificial tablets, information regarding the origin, composition and life cycle process to manufacture the fish pellets is transparent and traceable for consumers. We have also demonstrated that it is possible to regionally reposition nutrients embodied in invasive fish obtained from an ecosystem in which they are in excess and undesirable, into one in which they are presently depleted but were historically more naturally abundant. Flora and fauna in New Zealand exhibit high levels of endemism and organisms evolved in an environment that was historically free of terrestrial mammalian predators (Bull & Whitaker, 1975). Following relatively recent human occupation and the coincident introduction of numerous mammalian pests, catastrophic and widespread declines in biodiversity occurred (Atkinson, 1989), and continue today. Unsurprisingly, a wide range of governmental and community-based mammalian pest control and eradication programmes are in place throughout New Zealand and play an important role in biodiversity conservation (Ewen, Adams, & Renwick, 2013). Protein-based baits are typically used as lures for terrestrial pest control programmes. In particular, introduced mustelids (stoat Mustela erminea, weasel Mustela nivalis, ferret Mustela furo), feral cat Felis catus, rat species (Norway rat Rattus norvegicus, ship rat R. rattus), house mouse Mus musculus and European hedgehog Erinaceus europaeus are the primary targets for protein lures. Currently, the most effective lure is considered to be a commercially available rabbit-based product (“Erayz,” Connovations, NZ, C. Gillies, pers. comm.) that is typically deployed by conservation groups in kill traps. Chicken eggs are often used in tandem with rabbit jerky as an additional visual lure for mustelids. In this case study, a new line of 50 kill traps (DOC 250's, Curtis Metal Products, NZ—double-ended spring-loaded, http://www.predatortraps.com/) were established around the perimeter of the National Wetlands Centre, North Island, New Zealand. A combination of egg and rabbit or invasive fish pellet baits was placed in alternating kill traps by a local conservation community group with bait type (rabbit/egg or fish) in the first trap determined randomly. Traps were checked approximately monthly by volunteers (Figure 5) and results of any kills documented and reported. Preliminary results after 9 months of trapping suggest that invasive fish baits are attractive to some terrestrial pests, in particular hedgehogs and rats (Table 2). Currently, traps with fish bait have a greater number of confirmed kills for hedgehogs (Friedman rank sum test, p = .014), and a comparable number for rats (p = .479), compared to traps with rabbit/egg baits. Thus far, only stoats (p = .025) and mice (p = .045) have been preferentially lured by traps with rabbit/egg baits. Based on these results, invasive fish baits appear to be a durable, promising and complementary lure for controlling rats and hedgehogs in particular. Further ongoing testing is expected to provide more robust conclusions on the long-term effectiveness of fish-based bait for this purpose. Internationally many examples exist where invasive animals are commercially harvested from non-native habitats and various components reused. In most cases, the end products tend to support other human needs and wants with the majority of invasive product outputs related either directly or indirectly to food consumption (e.g. Nuñez, Kuebbing, Dimarco, & Simberloff, 2012) and or clothing production (e.g. http://thefishleather.co/). For example, there are cookbooks dedicated to the consumption of invasive species (e.g. Franke, 2007). As exemplified in the two trial case studies presented, the general philosophy of the “CarpN-neutral project” has been to use invasive species products for addressing other conservation problems rather than more typically creating products that directly benefit human consumption or use. Whether used as an alternative fertiliser or as a complementary lure in terrestrial pest control, the material has a low footprint and the products are likely to be organically certifiable. In New Zealand, organic certification can be obtained from two primary service providers: BioGrow NZ and AssureQuality. Each have minimum requirements to meet the standard for “compost” which predominantly relates to heavy metal concentrations and the presence of pesticides in the final invasive fish pellet product, both which have been extensively tested for with results suggesting that requirements could be met (Tables S5 and S6). An operational model whereby the running costs of this regional programme (currently paid for by regional ratepayers) could be recovered is possible with an increase in scale of our existing demonstration site (Figure 1). At present, managers and community groups pay an average of NZD 15 cents/artificial imported fertiliser tablet. Thus, to fertilise c. 350 dune plants with artificial fertilisers would cost around NZD $50 (c. 3.5 kg tablets)—for invasive fish pellets, NZD $50 equates to a 25 kg bag to deliver the same dose of nutrients to the same number of plants. The actual cost to produce 1 tonne (including pelletising and bagging but excluding harvest labour) is c. NZD $400. For pest lures or baits, rabbit jerky currently costs NZD 45c/piece/trap while the fish lure costs NZD 14c/trap (c. 70 g pellets/trap). However, it is acknowledged that commercialisation of such organisms can result in incentivising or facilitating further spread (Nuñez et al., 2012) which could result in a potential net environmental loss rather than gain (e.g. Barbier & Knowler, 2006). Consequently, our proposed regional government concept adopts a non-profit philosophy to remain cost neutral in this regard to discourage potential for profiteering through invasive species spread. A common argument regarding security of supply in such cases concerns the sustainability of the programme if harvest volumes decline due to intensive harvest pressure. Evidence from elsewhere in the Southern Hemisphere where invasive fish harvest has been commercialised suggests that, while temporary reductions in catch may occur within a given waterbody subject to intensive harvest, the wider population recovers rapidly once harvest pressure is reduced with little evidence of reductions in either distribution or biomass being sustained by harvest at larger scales (Koehn, Brumley, & Gehrke, 2000). Information relating to harvest impact is valuable for river managers as it clearly indicates that harvest pressure can reduce local biomass, and therefore, conservation priority catchments can be targeted for ongoing harvest pressure to achieve localised conservation outcomes (assuming other contributing anthropogenic pressures are also addressed). Meanwhile, a wider strategy which allows for a centralised processing facility and safe disposal point for harvest occurring in other areas, or by other entities (e.g. commercial operators, recreational anglers) could ensure security of supply of material. For instance during 2016, the CarpN Neutral programme provided a fish disposal service for the New Zealand Bowhunters Society at the annual “Koi Carp Classic” (http://www.nzbowhunters.nz/events/koi-carp-classic/) where c. 5 tonnes of invasive fish were harvested from the river by members during the event. These fish were then processed into pellets and later used in regional dune restoration planting. Although the scale of our dune planting trials was relatively small (2,400 plants in total), annual nursery propagation of sand-binding dune plants in New Zealand is estimated to be around 250,000 plants. If each of these plants was provided with 72 g fish pellets, c. 18 tonnes of invasive fish fertiliser (equivalent to c. 40 tonnes of processed wet weight fish) could be repositioned into dunes annually potentially replacing c. 2.5 tonnes of artificial fertiliser tablets. An important consideration of our concept is traceability and sustainability through various parts of the programme including: minimising by-catch of native fish species (David, 2015), using an energy efficient method to process invasive fish onsite (thermophilic bacteria), minimising carbon use in both production and distribution by using the material locally (Figures 1 and 6) and incorporating carbon into the product in the form of sawdust. As part of the dune planting experiment, we undertook chemical analyses of two other commercial fertiliser tablets commonly used in New Zealand. We noted that there was high variability in different trace and heavy metal elements between these two tablets (Tables S4 and S5). Although quality manufacturing standards for commercial artificial fertiliser production exist, disclosing all components within them (e.g. compounds for binding) appears to be voluntary. Taking our concept one step further, we are currently trialling the incorporation of biochar, a by-product of pyrolysis from corn production, into digested invasive fish. Biochar has been shown to increase nitrogen retention and lower greenhouse gas emissions when added to animal compost (Agyarco-Mintah et al., 2016). With respect to the use of biochar in fish pellets, the objective is to test its performance as a slow release fertiliser and also as a means of long-term carbon replacement and storage in sand and soil. Significant potential to further develop raw invasive fish flesh and liquid for use in other conservation projects also exists. For instance, foliar application of digested invasive fish “juice” as a potential liquid fertiliser and anti-lagomorph (e.g. rabbit) browse/repellent in native planting programmes is currently underway. New dune plantings can be heavily browsed by introduced herbivores during early growth. It is proposed that the oily content and strong “sulphurous” smell of this liquid may possess useful compounds as suggested by Trent, Nolte, and Wagner (2001), to reduce herbivorous browsing during early plant growth. At present, a U.S. produced bovine blood-based product is commonly applied in New Zealand for this purpose; http://www.plantskydd.com/rabbit-repellent.html.Other alternatives such as installing plant guards and fences to deter browsing in dunes are logistically challenging and costly to implement. Irrespective of the application, we posit that the simple approach of turning such outputs back into restoration programmes (and using products from one invasive animal to control another) creates potential to reduce overall costs for biodiversity enhancement and biosecurity while simultaneously dealing with unwanted organisms in areas where they are problematic. This project demonstrates a practical method of processing pest fish for use in restoration of other degraded ecosystems or put simply it is about “turning something bad into something good.” We consider this concept to be an alternative approach to restoration whereby an aquatic biosecurity problem is specifically being used to improve indigenous biodiversity outcomes across a range of other ecosystem types. We propose that this project is a useful vehicle to demonstrate genuine sustainability and promote awareness of the origin and fate of nutrients within and between ecosystems. It also illustrates alternate ways in which invasive products can be applied to these systems for positive environmental outcomes. A similar philosophy should be applicable to problematic and abundant invasive species elsewhere, particularly where those organisms are susceptible to either point source control or efficient mass harvest. This work would not have been possible without the assistance of dedicated volunteer community groups and coordinators.

",,,,,,"Surtsey and the older islands in the Vestmannaeyjar archepelago offer a unique possibility to study how subArctic ecosystems develop from unvegetated mineral volcanic substrate to grasslands with thick Brown Andosol soils. The present study was carried out on 24 study plots distributed across six different ecoystems on Surtsey, Heimaey and Elliðaey islands and involved field measurements of soil volumetric water content (VWC), vascular plant cover (VPC) and instantanious rate of gross primary production (GPP). Remote sensing was also used to determine the vegetation indices of normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), photochemical reflectance index (PRI) and chlorophyll/carotenoid index (CCI) of each plot and find their relationships to the measured VPC and GPP. Nýjahraun on Heimaey and the area not affected by seabirds on Surtsey were not significantly different in any measured variable. During their initial 48-58 years of primary succession, they had reached ca. 3% (VPC) to 12-13% (GPP, VWC) of the measured variables in the 5900-year-old Lyngfellisdalur on Heimaey, which has negligible seabird nutrient inputs. However, the measured VPC and GPP had reached similar levels in only 58 years in the seabird-affected parts of Surtsey as measured on the 5900-year-old seabird-affected Elliðaey. This shows how seabirds can greatly speed up ecosystem development by oceanic nutrient inputs into terrestrial ecosystems. Significant relationships were found between NDVI and VPC and between CCI and GPP, which may become important tools to track ecosystem development in space and time on the islands.

",,,,"By the mid 1980s, concerns about ozone depletion by chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and ensuing increases in ultraviolet-B radiation (UV-B) reaching the earth's surface prompted urgent research to examine the effects of UV-B on plant processes. Although international agreements have now slowed the production of CFCs, whether stratospheric ozone and UV-B levels will revert to the preozone-depletion levels of the 1970s by the end even of this century remains uncertain because of noncompliance and the positive feedback that greenhouse gases may have on ozone depletion (Madronich et al., 1998; Shindell et al., 1998). However, our ability to predict the impacts of changing UV-B levels on organisms and ecosystem processes is limited because few field studies have examined effects across multiple trophic levels. In this issue, Searles et al. (2001b) (see pp. 213–221) examine how solar UV-B influences plants and microbes at the southern extremity of South America, the Tierra del Fuego archipelago – an area that is experiencing enhanced solar UV-B levels during spring and summer due to the Antarctic ozone hole. Counterintuitively – since UV-B is deemed detrimental to most organisms – they found that some microbes, in particular testate amoebae, occur in higher numbers in a Sphagnum peatland under near-ambient UV-B than under reduced UV-B levels. Less surprisingly, these findings reemphasize that what we know about UV-B effects on plants cannot easily be extrapolated to predict how UV-B will affect other trophic levels in a system.","0028-646X

1227.0,"Synopsis of the vernacular names and the economic use of the indigenous orchids of Java
","van den Brink, R.",,,,,1937.0,,,38,51,,,,,,1,1,"Blumea. Supplement
",,,,,,"The Netherlands’ Indies are part of those humid tropical regions where innumerable species of orchids either may hang down, sometimes in large numbers, from the trunks and branches of trees and shrubs or grow terrestrially in woods or elsewhere. Nevertheless, to every naturalist who takes the trouble of ascertaining the attitude of the native population towards the orchid-family, it at once becomes clear that up to this very moment most of these plants have only succeeded in obtaining a very modest place in the domestic life and even in the interest of the natives. The beauty of the flowers of so very many species seems never or hardly at all to have been observed by them. This is so much the more noteworthy because in other cases the native has usually invented a name, if not a use, for most plants in his surroundings, even for the rarest and most unimportant ones. As regards orchids this has never happened. These plants seem never to have played any part in religious ceremonies and in the numerous myths they are mentioned at best by a few words. On none of the old monuments they are immortalized; even on ornaments of a later date one usually seeks in vain for these plants or their flowers. How is this aloofness of the natives towards such an important part of the flora of their country to be accounted for? Orchids never were of much use either in domestic life or in the domain of medicinal science. Only with the arrival of the Europeans or, more correctly speaking, not before a very short time ago, some interest for orchids was raised with the natives. But this took, practically, only place in imitation of the foreigner, especially when the natives began to see that money was to be made in the orchid-trade. Here and there this unnatural predilection has already lead to consequences of alarming dimensions, because it has not rarely effected the complete or partial extermination of valuable species in regions where formerly they grew copiously. Nevertheless a change in the native denomination of orchids can hardly be observed. All these plants are simply called Anggrèk or Angkrèk and, as a rule, it is not deemed necessary to add a specific name. Only very few orchids can really boast of such a name; most of them remain anonymous. The names Angkrèk panèli and Angkrèk lotjis, Spatulotjis or Spatuklotis are mere corruptions of Vanilla and Spathoglottis. Angkrèk bulan (Phalaenopsis amabilis) and Anggrèk matjan (Vanda tricolor), though both composed of genuinely native words, do not seem to be quite original, though this case is not identical with the two former ones; these names seem only translations of the Dutch names Maan-orchidee (Moon-orchid) and Tijger-orchidee (Tigerorchid). Yet some specific denominations exist, as a rule with some unimportant addition to the word Anggrèk or Angkrèk, e.g. běněr (bětul) = true; beureum (mèrah) = red; bodas (putih) = white; konèng (kuning) = yellow; gědè (běsar) = big; leutik (kětjil) = small, and such-like which, as a matter of fact, have little to do with the notion of species. Very often they only seem to have been invented by plantcollectors wishing to content troublesome interrogators by some plausible answer. Finally there exist some poetic names, for the greater part of very recent date, of which it is likewise difficult to ascertain whether they are really true ones or came into existence by European influences. From the foregoing, in my opinion, it sufficiently appears that the natives hardly knew how to distinguish plants of this group which, in our eyes, is so very interesting. Once more, how is this fact to be accounted for? He who knows better is, of course, free to say so, but to me this enigmatical aloofness of the natives towards orchids seems to prove that these plants do not interest him in any way. The same case presents itself with most Europeans as regards funguses, mosses, algae a.s.o., groups of plants growing in our immediate environment, unsurveyable to many, which seem not to stir our imagination. I cannot find any other explanation of the fact. Notwithstanding what I have said herebefore it may be of interest to shortly discuss which value part at least of the native population of Java sets to orchids, not exclusively regarding the very small economic worth of a few ones but especially with a view to the denomination of the diverse species. Most of the popular names mentioned beneath have proved to be of recent date. Hence they are not yet universally used; often they are of local value only; sometimes they were invented by cunning plant collectors for the benefit of their employers. Nevertheless they are worthy of being registered, with discrimination of course and spelled in the right way. By doing so we may in future attain a better surveyable and more reliable denomination of orchids than could be made now. Everyone who is acquainted with the love felt by the natives for nature and with their extensive knowledge of the multitude of forms shown by the flora of their surroundings, knows quite well how important it is, and will ever be, to judiciously exchange thoughts with them. The native likes to hoax those who do not understand him and it leaves him quite cool whether by his conduct the European thinks to have found one reason more of storming furiously against the traditional irreliability of native information about plants and plant-names. He has had to swallow severer reproaches than the annihilating opinion of incompetent persons. The fault does not lie exclusively with the natives nor entirely with the Europeans but is caused by the lack of a universally acknowledged classification of the popular names in existence. My treatise aims at contributing my mite to a correct valuation of the notions of both parties. Therefore, let us not begin with stumbling over the numerous brand-new plant-names met with at present everywhere but let us express the hope that, once sifted, they will prove useful enough to enable one to find his way in the Indian flora. Wherefore should we hesitate to register names unknown up to now, because they are not yet generally used throughout the island? If ever, then now surely the time has come to take a broad view of this matter, now that the interest shown for orchids by the different races of the population is rapidly increasing, though modern fashion may play a great part in pushing it forward.",,,,,,,,,,,,Yes,,,,,,

",,,,"The land snails and slugs have the highest level of endemism among all major animal groups on the California Channel Islands, with nearly 75% of the native terrestrial species confined to one or more of the 8 islands. In spite of this endemism, and in spite of the rarity of some species, the snails and slugs are one of the most poorly known groups. We present the first comprehensive overview of the land mollusk fauna of the Channel Islands, along with the results of recent intensive inventory studies. Surveys on San Clemente Island have increased the number of land mollusk species known from that island by 50%, and a single survey trip to Santa Rosa Island more than doubled the number of species known on that island. More additions to the land snail and slug fauna are certain for the poorly surveyed northern Channel Islands. This new information has provided insight into trends in species diversity and biogeographic patterns, with marked differences in species composition between the northern and southern islands. Our surveys to date suggest a strong link between the recovery of native vegetation on the islands and the population status of land snails and slugs, with substantially larger numbers of native mollusks on those islands that have been free of nonnative mammals the longest. Survey work is continuing, but it is clear that some very rare endemic snails and slugs on the islands merit specific management attention.

Here, we compare the structure and carrion consumption efficiency of the scavenger communities occurring in terrestrial and shallow marine habitats on and around a Mediterranean island. During July 2018, we monitored the consumption of 23 fish (Sparus aurata) and 34 bird (Larus michahellis) carcasses in Grosa Island (Murcia, SE Spain), which were placed both on land and below water. We recorded the vertebrate and invertebrate species occurring at carcass sites by means of visual inspection (vertebrates and invertebrates in marine habitats and invertebrates in terrestrial habitats) and motion-triggered cameras (vertebrates in terrestrial habitats). The vertebrate scavenger community was richer in the marine environment, whereas the total and invertebrate community were richer in the terrestrial one. The scavenger community was usually well-structured (i.e., nested), with the exception of the community associated with fish carcasses on land, which were very efficiently detected and consumed by yellow-legged gulls. In contrast, gulls left conspecific carcasses almost untouched, thus allowing longer persistence of gull carcasses on land and their exploitation by a diverse insect community. Our study shows important differences in the scavenging process associated with both the environment and carcass type.

",,,,"Snail-eating predators have various specialized organs and predation behaviors to overcome the hard shells and defensive traits of gastropods (Symondson, 2004; Vermeij, 2015). In terrestrial ecosystems, larvae of some species of the Lampyridae, Carabidae, and Elateridae families (Coleoptera) prey on land snails by attaching to the shell and injecting venom to weaken them or else by breaking open the shell with their strong mandibles (Sato, 2019; Symondson, 2004). These snail eaters search actively by tracking land snail mucus trails (Ng et al., 2013; Sato, 2019; Symondson, 2004); no obvious ambush predator of these land snails has so far been found. Here, we report the unique ambush predation of land snails by larvae of Anthracalaus click beetles (Elateridae: Agrypninae) in the larvae's nest burrows. Known Anthracalaus species comprise 17 species from Southeast Asia to Australia (and one species in Arizona, USA). Japan is home to only one species, Anthracalaus sakaguchii, in the Ryukyu Islands (Appendix S1: Figure S1) (Calder & Von Hayek, 1992). Until now, the larval stages of this genus have not been found, and their life histories are completely unknown (Calder & Von Hayek, 1992; Ohira, 2017). During our survey of land snails in the Ryukyus, we found many Satsuma mercatoria (Gastropoda: Camaenidae) killed with their soft body parts pulled into burrows on bare ground at forest edges on Kume Island (Figure 1A; Appendix S1: Figure S2A–D). Elateridae larvae ~3 cm in length collected from these burrows (Figure 1B) were morphologically identified as A. sakaguchii from the adults that emerged in captivity (Appendix S1: Figure S2E). Larvae have sharp sickle-shaped mandibles for predation and forked shovel-like abdominal terga (Figure 1C,D; Appendix S1: Figure S3). During larval habitat and ecological surveys on Kume Island in daytime on 23 January 2020, we examined 43 beetle burrows with dead snails in a 350-m section of bare ground along the forest edges. For each burrow, we recorded the species, number, and shell diameter of dead snails found within 5 cm of the burrow. For comparison, we also recorded snail fauna and abundance in the same section, releasing the snails after measurement, from 9:00 to 10:00 p.m. on 22 January. The predatory behavior of larvae of A. sakaguchii were examined using S. mercatoria collected in the Okinawa Islands. The genus Satsuma comprises large land snails with remarkable speciation, with species and subspecies unique to each of the Ryukyu Islands of Japan. Three endemic Satsuma species—S. mercatoria kumejimaensis, S. perversa, and S. omoro—are distributed on Kume Island (Kameda, 2017). However, two alien S. mercatoria subspecies (S. m. mercatoria and S. m. miyakoensis) that have invaded Kume Island are difficult to identify, so these were treated as ""Satsuma mercatoria"" in this study. Acusta despecta despecta (Bradybaenidae) is a common species widely distributed in the Ryukyu Islands, but the genus is most likely to have lost its regional endemism owing to frequent movement and hybridization between populations caused by anthropogenic transportation (Tomiyama & Imamura, 2020). We found 53 snail shells around the nest burrows, comprising 51 of S. mercatoria (shell diameter mean ± SD 23.1 ± 4.1 mm, range 14.8–30.2 mm) and two of A. despecta despecta (8.5 and 16.8 mm) (Appendix S1: Table S1). Sixteen of these Satsuma snails had just been dragged into the burrow and were still alive, indicating that they were preyed upon during the survey. In the land snail fauna survey, we collected 84 individuals of four species: A. despecta despecta (N = 1, 13.2 mm), Bekkochlamys perfragilis (N = 19, 15.8 ± 0.8 mm, 14.5–17.7 mm), S. mercatoria (N = 63, 22.9 ± 5.1 mm, 12.6–32.1 mm), and S. omoro (N = 1, 17.1 mm). Ground-dwelling arthropods, such as two-spotted crickets (Gryllus bimaculatus) and some cockroaches (e.g., Rhabdoblatta guttigera), were also observed in the survey area, but no predation on these animals was observed. The shells of dead snails reflected the land snail fauna at the site. We have also repeatedly observed predation of Satsuma snails by A. sakaguchii larvae in captivity (Figure 1E; Video S1). The larvae of A. sakaguchii are unique among elaterids in that they form nest burrows and capture land snails. Elateridae larvae are generally categorized as burrowers or wanderers and are almost never known to build nests. The exception is Pyrearinus luminescent click beetles, which form sedentary nests in termite mounds (Costa & Vanin, 2010). The A. sakaguchii's nest burrows were concentrated in bare areas at the forest edge with little vegetation cover; we could not find any in environments with more cover. The nest entrance of last instar larvae (body length 30–40 mm) was 8–10 mm in diameter and 10–20 cm deep. The tunnels were oval and winding, and just below the entrance was a space created early in nest construction that widens on one side (Figure 1E; Video S2). During pupation, this space is widened, and the nest entrance and tunnel are sealed with soil to create the pupal chamber. A sketch of a Pyrearinus nest by Costa and Vanin (2010) similarly shows a small atrium near the entrance, which they describe as a ""marshaling yard"" that serves to store predigested prey and facilitate the reversal of larval migration. The similarity in nest shape between Pyrearinus and Anthracalaus is interesting in considering their phylogenetic relationship. Another ground-burrowing predator, such as the tiger beetle (Coleoptera: Cicindelidae) larvae, construct much straighter burrows and feed mainly on arthropods and rarely prey on land snails (Hori, 1982). Although A. sakaguchii larvae do not have the specialized and conspicuous morphology found in other land-snail eaters, they may be able to efficiently prey on land snails in a unique way by using their nest burrows. The soft parts of the captured snail are dragged into a narrow burrow, where the shell jams at the entrance of the nest, allowing the larvae to pull out and eat all the soft parts. Satsuma and Acusta land snails defend themselves by shaking their shells against predators that attach to the shell, such as firefly larvae (Sato, 2019), but this defense does not appear to be effective against attack from beneath by A. sakaguchii larvae. Our finding indicates the existence of a novel ambush predation method in a snail-eating insect and sheds light on an overlooked interspecific interaction. This is an interesting case for advancing the study of predator–prey interactions between snail eaters and land snails to yield critical insights in evolutionary biology. We cannot yet define A. sakaguchii as a snail-eating specialist. Our survey of larval food items may be biased because snail shells are not edible and thus remain conspicuous around the nest burrows. However, the larvae accurately attacked the soft parts and repeatedly preyed on snails, and many of them were observed feeding on land snails during the survey. This observation implies that A. sakaguchii is adapted to snail predation and is highly dependent on land snails as a food source during the larval stage. Furthermore, they may attract land snails in some way (e.g., odors) for efficient predation, as do termite-eating Pyrearinus larvae (Costa & Vanin, 2010). Because land snails often actively feed on the carcasses and shells of other individuals for calcium and protein (Baur, 1992; Ozgo & Bogucki, 2006), the dead flesh left at the entrance to the nest burrow may attract even more prey. Future research should focus on the feeding habits of A. sakaguchii larvae and how the larvae attract land snails to their nests. Satsuma mercatoria kumejimaensis has been registered as a national endangered species under the Act on Conservation of Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora since February 2020. S. omoro has been registered under a wildlife protection ordinance of Okinawa prefecture since November 2020. Almost all of Kume Island lies within the Kume-jima Prefectural Natural Park, where a wildlife protection ordinance has been in force since September 2022.

1382.0,"The successful control of Orthezia insignis on St. Helena island saves natural populations of endemic gumwood trees, Commidendrum robustum.
","Fowler, Simon",,Flora; Scale insect,,,2005.0,,,52,63,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"The small South Atlantic island of St. Helena has a highly degraded but internationally significant terrestrial flora, now covering only 1% of its land area. The 2500 gumwood trees, Commidendrum robustum, in the last two natural stands, are an important part of this remnant flora. In 1991, a scale insect infesting the gumwoods was identified as Orthezia insignis. This South American pest is widespread in the tropics, but this was the first record from St. Helena. By 1993, there were severe patches of infestation of the scale, and over 100 gumwood trees were dead. If the exponential increase in the number of dead trees had continued, all 2500 trees would have been killed by 1995. This was a likely outcome given the lack of natural enemies, and abundance of alternative host plant species for the scale. Fortunately, O. insignis had a history of successful biological control in Hawaii, and several African countries, through the introduction between 1908 and 1959 of the predatory South American coccinellid beetle, Hyperaspis pantherina. The life history and environmental safety of the predator were studied in quarantine in the U.K., and in 1993 the St. Helena government gave permission for its introduction onto the island. In May 1993, 80 H. pantherina survived the 6-day journey to St. Helena, and were used to establish a laboratory colony, from which over 5000 beetles were released from June 1993 to February 1994. Monitoring was undertaken using visual counts of O. insignis and H. pantherina on 300 labelled branchlets on the gumwood trees. Although the cause of tree death was visually obvious, monitoring demonstrated significant correlations between the levels of attack by the scale and tree mortality. H. pantherina was detected on the labelled shoots in February 1994, and numbers then increased, coinciding with a 30× decrease in mean scale numbers. This measured reduction is conservative, because the number of live scales tended to be underestimated when debris from recent feeding by the coccinellid was present. There have been no further problems reported with the scale on St. Helena since 1995. Laboratory rearing of H. pantherina was discontinued in July 1995 because insufficient O. insignis could be found anywhere on the island. Biological control of O. insignis was successful, but the extensive blackening from sooty moulds on all surviving gumwood trees in February 1995, suggested that the predator was effective only just in time to prevent most of the trees being killed. Experimental transfers of O. insignis showed that the other three members of the endemic genus Commidendrum could also be at risk from the scale. The deliberate introduction of H. pantherina into St. Helena is an early example of biological control being initiated solely for conservation of indigenous biodiversity. It appears that this successful programme has saved the field population of a rare endemic plant from extinction.",,,,,,,,,,,,No,,,,,,

The results of the study showed that between 1999 and 2019, the average area of degraded peatlands amounted to 198,084.54 hectares. Furthermore, the optimal area of degraded peatlands utilized for agriculture amounted to 7,122.45 hectares . Inventory of degraded peatland using the land cover approach can be obtained faster, cheaper, easier than the terrestrial method. Opportunities for using degraded land for agricultural purposes were also identified through the selection of plant species that exhibited adaptability to peatlands and held economic value. These selected plants, including sago, rubber, areca nut, and liberika coffee, were developed within the Meranti Islands Regency.

1473.0,"The lost generation of Pemphigus populiglobuli (Hemiptera, Aphididae): exploring the taxonomy of the Svalbard aphids of genus Pemphigus

",,"BioMed Central
",,,,"Abstract Species identification within the aphid genus Pemphigus Hartig, 1839 poses challenges due to morphological similarities and host-plant associations. Aphids of this genus generally exhibit complex life cycles involving primary hosts (poplars) and secondary (mostly unrelated herbaceous) host-plants, with some species relying solely on root-feeding generation. An example is a representative of the genus Pemphigus , trophically associated with grass roots, found in the High Arctic Svalbard archipelago. Historical records tentatively identify it as Pemphigus groenlandicus (Rübsaamen, 1898), although its formal classification remains elusive, due to limited material of freshly collected samples. Recent collections from 2007 to 2024 across various Svalbard sites, revealed its presence under stones in sheltered microhabitats, providing valuable specimens for comparative studies. Our molecular analyses indicate that the Svalbard specimens are not a separate species commonly identified as P. groenlandicus , nor an anholocyclic generation of Pemphigus bursarius (Linnaeus, 1758) or P. borealis Tullgren, 1909, but represent a secondary generation of Pemphigus populiglobuli Fitch, 1859, the Nearctic poplar bullet gall aphid. This suggests that they may have lost their primary host associations and adapted to living on grass roots year-round. Our specimens did not host any known facultative symbionts; however, we detected a strain of Pseudomonas Migula, 1894, closely related to a cold-tolerant bacterium abundant in polar regions. The present study also investigates the taxonomic relationships and morphometric characteristics of grass-feeding Pemphigus populations across the Arctic and an isolated locations on the European continent. Specimens from Svalbard were compared with samples from Greenland and Iceland, but identified no substantial morphometric differences among these geographically separated populations. Similarly, analyses of samples of Pemphigus groenlandicus crassicornis Hille Ris Lambers, 1952 from Sweden and Spain reveals a high morphometric similarity to the Arctic population, indicating a strong link between these traits and geographical variability. Despite the limitations in fresh material availability across locations, minor morphometric variations and shared ecological niches (all populations studied inhabiting grass roots, a unique trait within the Pemphigus genus) suggest treating both P. groenlandicus and its subspecies crassicornis as a junior synonym to P. populiglobuli . The study also demonstrates that the secondary generation of P. populiglobuli is a terrestrial microarthropod that overwinters in a postembryonic life-stage in situ in soil and vegetation under harsh Arctic conditions, and its cryptic life complicates its distribution mapping.

1480.0,"Microbial lipid distribution and substrate potential of the organic matter interrestrial Siberian permafrost deposits from NE Siberia
","Stapel, Janina; Mangelsdorf, Kai; Schirrmeister, Lutz; Horsfield, Brian; Wagner, Dirk",,Thermokarst,,,2016.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"The investigation of microbial ecosystems in permafrost sediments is an important approach to understand the role of microbial organic matter transformation in permafrost sediments for past and future climate changes, and is of high relevance in today’s geoscience research (Wagner, 2008) due to the current debate on the temperature vulnerability of permafrost deposits. Especially, the interplay between the organic substrate and the distribution of the living and past microbial communities in Late Pleistocene (Yedoma) and Holocene permafrost deposits, as well as the substrate potential of the organic matter stored in potentially thawing permafrost deposits are in the focus of the current study. Our investigation is part of the BMBF CarboPerm project an interdisciplinary Russian-German cooperation on the formation, turnover and release of carbon from Siberian permafrost landscapes. Sample material derived from terrestrial permafrost cores drilled at the coast of Bour Khaya in the North-Eastern Siberian Arctic. The gathered core material comprises Late Pleistocene to early Holocene deposits separated by an ice wedge. The microbial life markers (intact phospholipids, PLs) prove the presence of currently living microorganisms in the entire permafrost sequence and show the highest concentration in the uppermost sample indicating an abundant microbial life in the active layer. In comparison, the PL profile is strongly decreased in the underlying permafrost deposits. Nevertheless, the inventory of the Phospholipid fatty acids (PLFAs) suggests that the cell membrane temperature adaptation to cold environmental conditions is mainly regulated via the ratio between iso- and anteiso-fatty acids (FAs) as well as the ratio between saturated and unsaturated FAs. The surface samples show higher proportions of anteiso and unsaturated FAs (adaptation to cooler conditions), which might derive from the fact that surface layers are more affected from the harsh Siberian winter conditions than the deeper constantly cold permafrost deposits, where the above-ground temperature extremes are buffered due to the overlying deposits. Indeed within the deeper permafrost sequence the variations of the ratios are rather small, indicating adaptation to similar constantly cold temperature conditions. Other microbial markers (GDGTs), already partly degraded and, therefore, not indicating microbial life, reveal similarities with the TOC content and an increase especially in Late Pleistocene deposits. This suggests increased microbial life during intervals in the Late Pleistocene presumably caused by periods of moisture and temperature increased environments. Pore water analysis reveals the presence of low molecular weight organic acids (LMWOA) such as acetate, being excellent substrates for microbial metabolism. In the Late Pleistocene deposits below the ice wedge the substrate depth profiles show significant similarities to the TOC content. These points to a link between the organic matter and the LMWOA concentrations solved in the pore water and to the potential of those permafrost layers to provide substrates for microbial greenhouse gas production. In contrast, in the active layer the LMWOA concentrations are low, reflecting an active microbial turnover in the surface layers. Ester cleavage experiments on the residual organic matter resulted in the release of ester linked LMWOAs forming a potential substrate pool when released in future. These bound LMWOA profiles are even better correlated to the TOC content suggesting that the deeper permafrost deposits (older organic material)are not significantly different from those in the surface sediment (fresh organic material). Overall this indicates that the organic matter stored in the permafrost deposits and, therefore, removed from the surface carbon cycle is not much different in terms of organic matter quality than the fresh surface organic material. Considering the discussed increase of permafrost thawing, this might imply a strong impact on the generation of greenhouse gases from permafrost areas in future with its feedback on climate evolution. In a second and ongoing study, four terrestrial permafrost cores spanning from the Eemian interglacial into the Holocene form Bol’shoy Lyakhovsky Island are investigated with the focus on the differences and potential of the organic matter by comparing Eemian, Late Pleistocene and Holocene deposits. First results already reveal similar relations between the living and dead microbial communities with respect to the availability of free substrates, and the quality and amount of the total organic carbon. The results on the future potential of these deposits will also be presented.
