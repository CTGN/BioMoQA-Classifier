39,32. The Fauna of the African Lakes: a Study in Comparative Limnology with special reference to Tanganyika,"Cunnington, W.A.",1920,Proceedings of the Zoological Society of London,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0008694614&doi=10.1111%2fj.1096-3642.1920.tb03243.x&partnerID=40&md5=60b7698e9b28898fd606dded528ee986,10.1111/j.1096-3642.1920.tb03243.x,"The special interest attaching to this comparative study of African lakes is due to the remarkable nature of the fauna of Tanganyika. That lake was discovered in 1858 by Burton and Speke, the latter bringing back with him shells considered to have a distinctly marine appearance. Subsequent collections emphasised this point, and interest was further increased by the discovery of a medusa by Böhm. A scientific expedition to investigate the fauna was despatched in 1895 in charge of J. E. S. Moore. The rich and unusual nature of the fauna then collected led him to formulate the hypothesis that Tanganyika represents an old Jurassic sea. In order to test the validity of this hypothesis, a second expedition, on which Moore was accompanied by Fergusson, left England in 1899. The result was held by Moore to justify the theory, and he embodied his conclusions in a work entitled “The Tanganyika Problem,” published in 1903. As the aquatic flora had not been taken into account, a third expedition was despatched to rectify that omission and make a further collection of animals. This left in 1904 in charge of the writer, returning in 1905. More recently still, in 1912‐13, the Belgian expedition of Louis Stappers visited the lake and obtained additional information. The scope of this paper includes, besides Tanganyika, the five adjacent lakes of most interest, viz.:–Victoria Nyanza, Nyasa, Albert Nyanza, Edward Nyanza, and Kivu. All these, with the exception of Lake Victoria, occupy portions of the Great Rift Valley, which has probably been formed by trough‐faulting on a stupendous scale. They lie in long narrow depressions bounded by escarpments rising to a height of two or three thousand feet above the level of the water. Nyasa and Tanganyika are very deep, the former reaching to over 780 metres and the latter to no less than 1435 metres. Victoria Nyanza has the largest area, but occupies only a shallow basin bounded by low hills. In all the lakes, but especially the largest, conditions are almost oceanic. Climatic differences are negligible, but water temperatures are uniformly high, showing an average of about 26o C. Analyses of the water have been made in very few instances. The water of Tanganyika, while fresh, is unusually rich in salts of magnesium, and that of Kivu contains excessive quantities of the latter as well as sodium salts. It is likely that the salinity of Tanganyika was greater formerly, and may still be subject to variation. Evidence exists of a considerable rise and fall in the level of the lake, yet it seems probable that rainfall and evaporation are very nearly balanced. There is reason to believe that Tanganyika had no outlet until it received an additional water supply from the Kivu basin, which was cut off from the Nile, and added to the drainage area of the big lake by the formation of a volcanic dam in recent geological times. Tanganyika would thus have been completely isolated and its waters more saline until an outflow was established. The present effluent appears to have been formed as an affluent, its bed being finally captured by a tributary of the Congo. A periodic rise and fall in the lake level may be caused by a temporary damming of the bed of the effluent, indirectly due to irregularities in the rainfall. As regards fauna, it is probable that at the present time all the six lakes have received fairly equal investigation. Only strictly aquatic animals are considered in this paper, but forms obtained from the neighbourhood of a lake are included in the totals. Tanganyika exhibits by far the most remarkable features, containing some 402 species of which 293 (nearly 73 per cent.) are endemic. Nyasa has a total second in point of size, but this has been artificially swollen by extra‐lacustrine records which are wanting for other lakes. It has only 24 per cent, of endemic forms, while Victoria Nyanza with a smaller total has a larger percentage of endemics, namely 38 per cent. The three smaller lakes show a great reduction both in number of types and number of endemics. Tanganyika is further distinguished in that 57 out of 168 genera are peculiar to its waters, whereas Nyasa can only muster 6 endemic genera and the other lakes fewer still. The fishes of Tanganyika are of outstanding interest, comprising 146 species, of which 121 are endemic. The most notable feature is the number and high degree of specialisation of the Cichlidse, which with 27 genera (21 endemic) and 89 species (84 endemic) is the richest Cichlid fauna in the world. A species of incrusting gymnolsematous Polyzoon occurs, such forms being mostly marine. There is a large molluscan fauna, and of the Gasteropods more than two‐thirds exhibit a marine‐like appearance. These are known as the thalassoid or halolimnic group and are without exception endemic. There are no thalassoid Lamellibranchs. ‘Twelve species of prawns are known’, typically fresh‐water in character, but specialised and all peculiar to the lake. There is an endemic genus of crabs, with 3 species. The Eucopepoda, Branchinra, and Ostracoda are well represented, each showing a large proportion of endemic species. The Cladocera are conspicuously absent from the lake and the Rotifera are relatively few in number. This may be related to the salinity of the water. The medusa originally described from Tanganyika has now been discovered in Victoria Myanaa and the Niger. There are four endemic species of fresh‐water sponges. Only 5 groups of animals contain no endemic types. Tanganyika is one of the most remarkable lakes in the world, the only Cases comparable being the Caspian Sea and Lake Baikal. Recent figures are difficult to ascertain, hut while Baikal may even surpass Tanganyika in the number of unique animal forms, it appears that the Caspian is less striking. There is reason to believe that the relations between marine and fresh‐water orgiuisms are intimate and due to a community of descent. The barriers which prevent a change of medium are not insurmountable. Organisms originated in the ocean, and have attained their distribution in fresh water in various ways. Moore regarded many of the Tanganyika types as relicts from a former ocean. The aquitic plants of Tanganyika are of less interest than the animals. The higher plants show no peculiarities, but the Algá differ from those of the remaining lakes. A number of species are endemic and others are usually marine or brackish in habit. The phytoplankton is rich in species, and more than 70 per cent. of the form do not occur in Nynsa or Victoria. Recent discoveries do not favour Moore's hypothesis of a marine Jurassic origin for Tanganyika. Neither his comparison of shells from the lake with marine fossil shells, nor his views on the primitive nature of the halolimnic Gasteropods, have been accepted by leading experts. No members of his halolimnic group, save the Polyzoon and the medusa, can be regarded as peculiarly marine. The Polyzoon is allied to a species Still living in Indian seas and the medusa is Known from other parts of Africa. The endemic animal types are held to be specialised rather than primitive in nature. Geological evidence is not more favourable. The extensive beds of sandstone and conglomerate which occur in the lake regions were probably formed under fresh‐water and terrestrial conditions. They are considered by some to be of Triassic age, but may belong to a much earlier period, i. e. Devonian. Thus there is no support for the view that the ocean at one time extended over the Congo basin. Further, there is much to show that the trough in which Tangnnyika lies was not formed until Middle Tertiary times. A comparison has been made between thalassoid shells from Tanganyika and a fresh‐water Cretaceous geniis on the one hand and fresh‐water Pliocene shells on the other. Since the thalassoid shells have been held to resemble types from such different sources, they offer little indication as to the origin of the lake fauna. The quasi‐oceanic conditions in Tangmyika may have produced an effect on the organisms it contains. Germain asserts that Gasteropods of marine aspect occur in other regions besides Tanganyika, and are derived from the fresh‐water types of a former vast lake basin. On the present lakes becoming isolated, the conditions in Tanganyika produced a more striking series of such forms than elsewhere. This view is not regarded as accept‐ able. It has been suggested that the salinity of the Tanganyika water has produced marine‐like forms, but further evidence is needed. The view that Titnganyika owes its remarkable organisms to a prolonged period of isolation is regarded as the most likely suggestion. It does not run counter to geological conceptions. This theory does not account for the medusa. Boulenger suggests that it may have survived from an Eocene sea in Northern Africa,. Gravier considers, on the contrary, that it may be a recent migrant from the ocean. The faunas of the remaining lakes are of less interest. Victoria Nyanza is next in importance to Tanganyika. The most conspicuous group is the fishes, with a large proportion of endemic species. The Mollusca also are noteworthy. The fauna of Nyasa is similar in character, but with fewer peculiar types. There are, however, 5 endemic genern of fishes. The smaller lakes contain representatives of fewer animal groups as well as fewer species. Kivu is the extreme case, with only ?3 species, of which 4 tire endemic. The poverty of its fauna may be associated with its exceptional salinity. Albert Nyanza. displays the smallest proportion of endemic types, viz. 13 per cent. It is suggested that periods of isolation would account for the peculiarities of Victoria Nyanza and Nyaaa. Certain animal types are unexpectedly absent from the African lakes. Such are the fresh‐water Crustacea Asellus and Gammarrus and the fish parasite Echinorhynchus. No explanation of this is forthcoming. The number of specific forms in these lakes appears to be proportional to the size. This would seem to hold good also for the number of genera and families and even for the number of groups represented. it is possible that this principle is of general application. It is thought to be analogous to the phenomenon exhibited by the flora of oceanic islands. The affinity between African and Indian fresh‐water types is recognisable in several instances among the inhabitants of the lakes. This affinity is explained by the former existence of a. continent which embraced them countries in the Carboniferous and subsequent periods. Little is known of the deeper regions of any of the lakes. It remains to be discovered whether associations of abyssal animals exist in them. Neither the vertical distribution of plankton forms, nor their seasonal variations have yet been studied. Further information is needed on the salts dissolved in the water, the depth and nature of the lake basins, water temperatures, etc. It is nevertheless possible from established facts to form a true conception of the nature of the lakes and their organisms.

How could identical species appear in widely separated parts of the world? Such disjunct distributions provoked considerable argument among the early naturalists. Some believed that a given species could be created only once, but others were proponents of multiple creations. 2. The kinds of disjunct distribution that have attracted the greatest interest are cases in which organisms living in the north temperate zone also occur as the same or a closely related species in the temperate zone of the southern hemisphere. 3. The interhemispheric disjuncts that were separated by the tropics were first referred to as ""bipolar distributions."" Later, the terms ""antitropical"" or ""amphitropical"" became more commonly used. 4. Within the marine environment, the surface waters of the Indo-West Pacific provide many examples of antitropical distribution. Two patterns are frequently found, one is confined to the western Pacific and one that includes, in addition, a relict population in the western Indian Ocean. Sometimes, the disjunct populations occur only along the east Asian coast and in southeast Africa. A few are found only in outer Polynesia. 5. Examination of many disjunct patterns showed that, in almost all cases, a distributional gap occurred in the central East Indies. This information, plus the fossil distributions of Strombus vomer and the chthamaloid barnacles, suggest that the disjuncts were caused by an extinction process that originated in the East Indies. 6. One hypothesis stated that rising Neogene temperatures, following a cool-water regime at low latitudes, caused the antitropical split. However, fossil evidence from invertebrates and coral reefs supports the view of a stable, warm tropical ocean since the mid-Cretaceous. 7. There are many antitropical species and genera in the eastern tropical Pacific. In this area, which is latitudinally less extensive than the western Pacific, a possible alternative to tropical extinction is migration from one cool, upwelling region to another. During the glacial stages, when the general thermohaline circulation was intensified, such upwellings may have been stronger and more numerous. 8. Many antitropical patterns may be found among the shelf biota of the Atlantic Ocean. Recent work on four families of gadoid fish suggested that their antitropical distributions were the result of equatorial extinctions of formerly widespread taxa. 9. It is concluded that the appearance of antitropical patterns in most shelf and epipelagic organisms represents a loss of territory that is probably the first step in the eventual extinction of those taxa. 10. For marine animals capable of existing in deep waters beyond the continental shelf, antitropicality may be the result of isothermic submersion. The most common route, which has been followed by representatives of many different families, extends from the North Pacific along the west coast of the Americas to the south temperate and Antarctic waters. 11. It is observed that the predominant interhemispheric dispersals in the Pacific Ocean have taken place from north to south. This indicates that the North Pacific has produced many dominant species that have been able to transgress biogeographic boundaries to invade the cool waters of the southern hemisphere. At the same time, the North Pacific biota has resisted penetration of species from other areas. 12. In the terrestrial environment, botanists have distinguished three kinds of antitropical distributions: bipolar disjuncts, temperate disjuncts, and desert disjuncts. While such patterns seem to be common in the New World, they are less frequent in the Old World. Many of the species in all three categories are attractive to migratory birds or live in habitats frequented by them. 13. Fossil materials indicate that some plant families (Araucariaceae, Winteraceae) were once widespread in the North but now have only a relict distribution in the southern hemisphere. Others, such as the Nothofagaceae and the Betulaceae, demonstrate antitropical relationships at the family level. 14. Antitropical patterns in terrestrial and freshwater animals occur in almost all major groups. In many insect groups, in which the phylogeny has been investigated, the most primitive living species have relict distributions in the southern hemisphere. Such relicts often have fossil relatives in the north indicating past antitropical distributions. 15. Among the vertebrates there are many antitropical patterns, most of them involving the older taxa. Like the insects, some archaic taxa exist only as southern hemisphere relicts but were, at one time, widespread in the north. Examples are the tuatara (Sphenodon) and the ratite birds. Some modern mammal families are in the process of retreating from their northern ranges and may eventually become southern hemisphere relicts. 16. Since 1981, several vicariant theories to explain antitropical distributions have been introduced. These have been termed the Pacifica, island integration, expanding earth, and the pre-Pangaean shuffle. All are applicable only to mid-Mesozoic or earlier times, although the causes of antitropicality have evidently operated continuously through time. These causes appear to be primarily tropical extinction and long-distance dispersal. 17. One may conclude that in general the older, more primitive, organisms tend to be concentrated at the higher latitudes. Many survive only in the southern hemisphere. This pattern is most apparent in ectothermic animals and is expressed most often at the higher taxonomic levels. 18. The younger, more recently evolved families and genera are concentrated in the tropics, probably because they evolved there and it takes time for them to become widespread, particularly in a latitudinal sense. As taxa gradually spread from their tropical centers of origin, the evolutionary process continues. The older, wide-ranging forms eventually become superseded by younger, newly evolved forms. 19. When a widespread species begins to undergo extinction, it will first lose the central tropics. As this process goes forward, the resulting pattern is likely to assume an antitropical shape in which the relict populations exist north and south of the tropics but not within them. 20. The foregoing explanation for antitropical patterns is not applicable to marine organisms capable of living in the deep sea nor to many higher plants whose propagules can be transported by birds. 21. Antitropical distributions are a global phenomenon. They often represent a stage in the extinction of older taxa and, at the same time, may signal the appearance of a new tropical replacement. The next step is often extinction in the north leaving relict populations in the southern hemisphere. With the demise of the southern populations, the extinction process becomes complete. 22. Animals and plants that manage to reach oceanic islands and to populate them constitute a special category of disjunct distributions. There have been attempts to explain the presence of the island biotas by means other than long-distance dispersal, but these have generally been discredited. 23. The islands of the Pacific plate demonstrate a biogeographic pattern that has three notable characteristics: (1) the flora and fauna exhibit definite western Pacific relationships; (2) there is a west to east diversity gradient; and (3) there is sometimes an abrupt elimination of certain groups from west to east. It is evident that the third characteristic does not occur in a random manner for it is those groups that have the least dispersal ability over salt water that drop out the quickest. © 1995 Elsevier B.V.

There are many antitropical species and genera in the eastern tropical Pacific. In this area, which is latitudinally less extensive than the western Pacific, a possible alternative to tropical extinction is migration from one cool, upwelling region to another. During the glacial stages, when the general thermohaline circulation was intensified, such upwellings may have been stronger and more numerous. 8. Many antitropical patterns may be found among the shelf biota of the Atlantic Ocean. Recent work on four families of gadoid fish suggested that their antitropical distributions were the result of equatorial extinctions of formerly widespread taxa. 9. It is concluded that the appearance of antitropical patterns in most shelf and epipelagic organisms represents a loss of territory that is probably the first step in the eventual extinction of those taxa. 10. For marine animals capable of existing in deep waters beyond the continental shelf, antitropicality may be the result of isothermic submersion. The most common route, which has been followed by representatives of many different families, extends from the North Pacific along the west coast of the Americas to the south temperate and Antarctic waters. 11. It is observed that the predominant interhemispheric dispersals in the Pacific Ocean have taken place from north to south. This indicates that the North Pacific has produced many dominant species that have been able to transgress biogeographic boundaries to invade the cool waters of the southern hemisphere. At the same time, the North Pacific biota has resisted penetration of species from other areas. 12. In the terrestrial environment, botanists have distinguished three kinds of antitropical distributions: bipolar disjuncts, temperate disjuncts, and desert disjuncts. While such patterns seem to be common in the New World, they are less frequent in the Old World. Many of the species in all three categories are attractive to migratory birds or live in habitats frequented by them. 13. Fossil materials indicate that some plant families (Araucariaceae, Winteraceae) were once widespread in the North but now have only a relict distribution in the southern hemisphere. Others, such as the Nothofagaceae and the Betulaceae, demonstrate antitropical relationships at the family level. 14. Antitropical patterns in terrestrial and freshwater animals occur in almost all major groups. In many insect groups, in which the phylogeny has been investigated, the most primitive living species have relict distributions in the southern hemisphere. Such relicts often have fossil relatives in the north indicating past antitropical distributions. 15. Among the vertebrates there are many antitropical patterns, most of them involving the older taxa. Like the insects, some archaic taxa exist only as southern hemisphere relicts but were, at one time, widespread in the north. Examples are the tuatara (Sphenodon) and the ratite birds. Some modern mammal families are in the process of retreating from their northern ranges and may eventually become southern hemisphere relicts. 16. Since 1981, several vicariant theories to explain antitropical distributions have been introduced. These have been termed the Pacifica, island integration, expanding earth, and the pre-Pangaean shuffle. All are applicable only to mid-Mesozoic or earlier times, although the causes of antitropicality have evidently operated continuously through time. These causes appear to be primarily tropical extinction and long-distance dispersal. 17. One may conclude that in general the older, more primitive, organisms tend to be concentrated at the higher latitudes. Many survive only in the southern hemisphere. This pattern is most apparent in ectothermic animals and is expressed most often at the higher taxonomic levels. 18. The younger, more recently evolved families and genera are concentrated in the tropics, probably because they evolved there and it takes time for them to become widespread, particularly in a latitudinal sense. As taxa gradually spread from their tropical centers of origin, the evolutionary process continues. The older, wide-ranging forms eventually become superseded by younger, newly evolved forms. 19. When a widespread species begins to undergo extinction, it will first lose the central tropics. As this process goes forward, the resulting pattern is likely to assume an antitropical shape in which the relict populations exist north and south of the tropics but not within them. 20. The foregoing explanation for antitropical patterns is not applicable to marine organisms capable of living in the deep sea nor to many higher plants whose propagules can be transported by birds. 21. Antitropical distributions are a global phenomenon. They often represent a stage in the extinction of older taxa and, at the same time, may signal the appearance of a new tropical replacement. The next step is often extinction in the north leaving relict populations in the southern hemisphere. With the demise of the southern populations, the extinction process becomes complete. 22. Animals and plants that manage to reach oceanic islands and to populate them constitute a special category of disjunct distributions. There have been attempts to explain the presence of the island biotas by means other than long-distance dispersal, but these have generally been discredited. 23. The islands of the Pacific plate demonstrate a biogeographic pattern that has three notable characteristics: (1) the flora and fauna exhibit definite western Pacific relationships; (2) there is a west to east diversity gradient; and (3) there is sometimes an abrupt elimination of certain groups from west to east. It is evident that the third characteristic does not occur in a random manner for it is those groups that have the least dispersal ability over salt water that drop out the quickest. © 1995 Elsevier B.V.

The Cretaceous was a time of extensive inland seas, a moist tropical climate, and a high CO 2 level. These conditions permitted a high level of primary production on land and in the inland seas. It provided fodder for a large mass of herbivores which, in turn, permitted the evolution of a variety of carnivores. 2. A series of continental movements took place which, to a large extent, established biogeographic patterns that are still evident in our modern floras and faunas. These movements resulted in the completion of the Tethys Sea, the separation of Africa and South America, the formation of Beringia, the isolation of Australia, and the rift of Africa from Europe. 3. Distribution patterns in the shallow seas are best illustrated by Kauffman's (1973) work on bivalve molluscs. Subsequent works on other marine invertebrates have tended to corroborate those patterns. They provided important information on the timing and subsequent effects of the continental movements. 4. Marine fossils appear to indicate the establishment of an early Cretaceous sea lane extending all the way from southwestern South America, across the South Atlantic, and up the African east coast. These data suggest a separation of Antarctica-Australia from the rest of Gondwana at an earlier time than usually recognized. 5. Fundamental changes in the world's flora took place in the Cretaceous. The earlier Mesozoic complex of conifers, cycadophytes, and ginkophytes began to be replaced, in the Aptian-Albian, by angiosperms. By the Upper Cretaceous, angiosperms became the dominant group of higher plants. Their geographic origin has been the subject of considerable speculation. Modern distributions suggest the southeast Asian area. 6. Floral patterns for the early and middle Cretaceous consisted of several latitudinal belts that were probably temperature controlled. By the late Cretaceous, four provinces could be recognized: a broad Pantropical Province, a southern Australian-Antarctic Province, an Aquilapollenites Province for Westamerica-Asia and a Normapolles Province for Euramerica. 7. Some archaic freshwater fish groups demonstrate a late-Cretaceous relationship across the North pacific while others may have extended across the North Atlantic. The secondary freshwater fish order Cyprinodontiformes probably originated in the New World tropics and reached Africa in the mid-Cretaceous over a relatively narrow saltwater gap. The family Cichlidae probably arose in Africa in the late Cretaceous, then reached South America by negotiating a larger seawater gap. 8. Salamanders are primarily a Laurasian group. Four families occur mainly in North and Central America, one in Asia, and one in Eurasia. Their general areas of origin and subsequent dispersals demonstrate both North Atlantic and North Pacific connections. The Cretaceous Mid-Continental Sea affected the distributions of some of the genera. 9. The caecilians are primarily a Gondwana order, with three out of the five families occurring in South America. Two of the South American families are endemic. Three families occur in India, but they supposedly got there from Africa when India was close by. One family is found on the Seychelles, and was probably stranded there when that island group broke away from India. 10. The frogs are also primarily a Gondwanan order. Almost all the older families existed in South America-Africa. North America and Australia-New Zealand apparently received their early frogs from South America. India received its four families from Africa. Two frog stocks were left on the Seychelles when those islands were rifted from India. The frogs of Madagascar are also related to those of Africa. 11. Although Cretaceous dinosaur distribution generally illustrates the Laurasian-Gondwana dichotomy, there is evidence of some interhemispheric traffic. In the late Cretaceous, hadrosauroid and ceratopsian dinosaurs reached South America from the north by means of an isthmian connection, while the titanosaurids went the opposite direction. Two European genera apparently reached Africa by a transtethyan route. The dinosaur fauna of Australia comprised an archaic community indicating that it may have been isolated from the rest of the world. 12. The early history of lizards seems to indicate the initial presence of a Gondwanan iguanian group and a basic Laurasian group which was ancestral to all other lizards. The most primitive true lizards belong to the family Iguanidae, a group that arose in Africa-South America. Subsequent dispersals involved Central American, North Pacific, North Atlantic, and African-Indian connections. Snakes probably evolved in the southern hemisphere from a lizard ancestral stock. 13. Marsupial and placental mammals diverged from a common ancestor in the early or mid-Cretaceous. By the late Cretaceous their distribution patterns showed considerable differences. They were nearly equally abundant in North America and both occurred, in lesser numbers, in South America. But, at this time, marsupials were unknown in Asia while placentals were common. Neither group is positively known from the Cretaceous of Africa or Australia. This pattern may be related to the existence of a Laurasian ancestor giving rise to the marsupials in Westamerica and the placentals in Asia. With the advent of the North Pacific connection, placentals may have been introduced to Westamerica, to the eventual detriment of the marsupials. 14. In Australia, the high incidence of endemism involving geographical and phylogenetic relicts indicates that, during the Cretaceous, it was cut off from the rest of the world. There were apparently no animal migrations into Australia during that Period. The isolation was probably caused by epicontinental seas rather than tectonic movement. 15. Maps based on geophysical data have consistently depicted Cretaceous India being situated far out in the Tethys Sea. Almost all the biogeographic evidence indicates that this could not have been the case. Instead, India was probably located adjacent to the Somali Peninsula in northeast Africa. 16. The Cenomanian-Turonian extinction occurred during a major sea-level rise. Significant losses took place in the marine environment, but there was not a notable decline among terrestrial animals and plants. 17. The Cretaceous-Tertiary extinction episode, which took place about 65 Ma ago, had severe effects on the tropical marine habitat. Some groups, such as the rudists, inoceramids, ammonites, and the great marine reptiles (plesiosaurs and mosasaurs) became extinct. Others sustained severe losses. In contrast, the deep-sea and high-latitude faunas suffered very little. 18. On land, there is very little evidence that terrestrial species in general suffered much extinction at the K/T boundary. There is no indication that diversity among the insects, which comprise more than 80% of the total metazoan species diversity, suffered any decline. Among the vertebrates, which comprised a small fraction of the total species diversity, the losses were much higher among the land-dwellers compared to the freshwater forms. It was the larger land-dwellers, with individually high demands on primary productivity (dinosaurs, marsupials), that suffered the most. 19. Considering all the affected groups, marine and terrestrial, it is apparent that the extinction process did not occur with catastrophic suddenness. The losses generally took place over periods of about one to several Ma. The time spans required for the recovery of diversity were even longer, ranging from about 3 to almost 25 Ma. 20. There was only one fundamental global event that occurred gradually at a rate consistent with the general tempo of the K/T extinctions: a regression of sea level probably caused by a cooling and shrinking of the mid-ocean ridges. The draining of the epicontinental seas and the associated climatic changes on land drastically reduced primary production. This production formed the base of the food pyramid in both environments. The large animals could therefore no longer be supported. The smaller forms survived because their demands on primary production were individually less. 21. Associated factors, which may have placed additional pressure on the biota, could have been volcanic eruptions and an asteroid impact. Some of the fossil materials (marine plankton and vascular plants) appear to indicate relatively short-term extinctions that are possibly attributable to such events. But, in most cases, the losses were gradual and extended over periods of millions of years. © 1995 Elsevier B.V.

How could identical species appear in widely separated parts of the world? Such disjunct distributions provoked considerable argument among the early naturalists. Some believed that a given species could be created only once, but others were proponents of multiple creations.2. The kinds of disjunct distribution that have attracted the greatest interest are cases in which organisms living in the north temperate zone also occur as the same or a closely related species in the temperate zone of the southern hemisphere.3. The interhemispheric disjuncts that were separated by the tropics were first referred to as “bipolar distributions.” Later, the terms “antitropical” or “amphitropical” became more commonly used.4. Within the marine environment, the surface waters of the Indo-West Pacific provide many examples of antitropical distribution. Two patterns are frequently found, one is confined to the western Pacific and one that includes, in addition, a relict population in the western Indian Ocean. Sometimes, the disjunct populations occur only along the east Asian coast and in southeast Africa. A few are found only in outer Polynesia.5. Examination of many disjunct patterns showed that, in almost all cases, a distributional gap occurred in the central East Indies. This information, plus the fossil distributions of Strombus vomer and the chthamaloid barnacles, suggest that the disjuncts were caused by an extinction process that originated in the East Indies.6.

For marine animals capable of existing in deep waters beyond the continental shelf, antitropicality may be the result of isothermic submersion. The most common route, which has been followed by representatives of many different families, extends from the North Pacific along the west coast of the Americas to the south temperate and Antarctic waters. 11. It is observed that the predominant interhemispheric dispersals in the Pacific Ocean have taken place from north to south. This indicates that the North Pacific has produced many dominant species that have been able to transgress biogeographic boundaries to invade the cool waters of the southern hemisphere. At the same time, the North Pacific biota has resisted penetration of species from other areas. 12. In the terrestrial environment, botanists have distinguished three kinds of antitropical distributions: bipolar disjuncts, temperate disjuncts, and desert disjuncts. While such patterns seem to be common in the New World, they are less frequent in the Old World. Many of the species in all three categories are attractive to migratory birds or live in habitats frequented by them. 13. Fossil materials indicate that some plant families (Araucariaceae, Winteraceae) were once widespread in the North but now have only a relict distribution in the southern hemisphere. Others, such as the Nothofagaceae and the Betulaceae, demonstrate antitropical relationships at the family level. 14. Antitropical patterns in terrestrial and freshwater animals occur in almost all major groups. In many insect groups, in which the phylogeny has been investigated, the most primitive living species have relict distributions in the southern hemisphere. Such relicts often have fossil relatives in the north indicating past antitropical distributions. 15. Among the vertebrates there are many antitropical patterns, most of them involving the older taxa. Like the insects, some archaic taxa exist only as southern hemisphere relicts but were, at one time, widespread in the north. Examples are the tuatara (Sphenodon) and the ratite birds. Some modern mammal families are in the process of retreating from their northern ranges and may eventually become southern hemisphere relicts. 16. Since 1981, several vicariant theories to explain antitropical distributions have been introduced. These have been termed the Pacifica, island integration, expanding earth, and the pre-Pangaean shuffle. All are applicable only to mid-Mesozoic or earlier times, although the causes of antitropicality have evidently operated continuously through time. These causes appear to be primarily tropical extinction and long-distance dispersal. 17. One may conclude that in general the older, more primitive, organisms tend to be concentrated at the higher latitudes. Many survive only in the southern hemisphere. This pattern is most apparent in ectothermic animals and is expressed most often at the higher taxonomic levels. 18. The younger, more recently evolved families and genera are concentrated in the tropics, probably because they evolved there and it takes time for them to become widespread, particularly in a latitudinal sense. As taxa gradually spread from their tropical centers of origin, the evolutionary process continues. The older, wide-ranging forms eventually become superseded by younger, newly evolved forms. 19. When a widespread species begins to undergo extinction, it will first lose the central tropics. As this process goes forward, the resulting pattern is likely to assume an antitropical shape in which the relict populations exist north and south of the tropics but not within them. 20. The foregoing explanation for antitropical patterns is not applicable to marine organisms capable of living in the deep sea nor to many higher plants whose propagules can be transported by birds. 21. Antitropical distributions are a global phenomenon. They often represent a stage in the extinction of older taxa and, at the same time, may signal the appearance of a new tropical replacement. The next step is often extinction in the north leaving relict populations in the southern hemisphere. With the demise of the southern populations, the extinction process becomes complete. 22. Animals and plants that manage to reach oceanic islands and to populate them constitute a special category of disjunct distributions. There have been attempts to explain the presence of the island biotas by means other than long-distance dispersal, but these have generally been discredited. 23. The islands of the Pacific plate demonstrate a biogeographic pattern that has three notable characteristics: (1) the flora and fauna exhibit definite western Pacific relationships; (2) there is a west to east diversity gradient; and (3) there is sometimes an abrupt elimination of certain groups from west to east. It is evident that the third characteristic does not occur in a random manner for it is those groups that have the least dispersal ability over salt water that drop out the quickest. © 1995 Elsevier B.V.

Spill effects on the habitats these organisms occupy have received less attention, but they are no less important. For 2.5 yr following the Exxon Valdez oil spill in Prince William Sound, Alaska, we studied the use of oil-affected habitats by 42 species of marine-oriented birds. On 11 survey cruises, we surveyed bays that had received different levels of initial oiling. We related the abundance of individual species in the bays to the oiling gradient, using regression models that included habitat measures to control for variations among the sites in features other than oiling level. We defined a spill-induced impact as a statistically significant relationship between the abundance of a species and values along the oiling gradient, after accounting for the effects of variations in habitat features. We used among-year comparisons of regressions between oiling levels and abundance, controlled for season, to assess recovery. We concluded that recovery from a spill-induced impact had occurred when we no longer could detect a significant relationship between a species' abundance and oiling levels. Overall, 23 (55%) of the 42 species exhibited no initial negative impacts on their use of oil-affected habitats.

Tropical hardwood hammock forests in southern Florida experience frequent disturbance by hurricanes. Our studies of forest regeneration during two years following a recent severe hurricane suggest that invasive non-indigenous forest species exhibit the same range of ecological roles as native forest species and compete with native species for particular kinds of regeneration opportunities. To study ecological roles of non-indigenous species in regenerating forests after Hurricane Andrew, we set up four large study areas at each of three study sites that had differing amounts of hurricane-caused canopy disturbance. There were two pairs of 30 x 60 m research plots per site, and in each pair there was one control plot and one restoration plot; restoration areas were subject to an aggressive management program, focused on reducing non-indigenous vine cover. Within these study areas we subsampled vegetation in small study plots that were regularly spaced, and conducted vegetation censuses in April (the end of the dry season) and October (the end of the rainy season) for 2 yr, beginning in April 1993. We found that the source of regeneration for forest species was dependent upon the amount of canopy disturbance, the time since disturbance, and the autecology of the constituent species. Overall, 28% of the 90 species were non-indigenous: 34% of the vines (N=32) and 24% of other life-forms (N=58). Non-indigenous vines seemed to have a special role; not only could they compete with native vines, but they could also negatively affect the regeneration of other natives from a diverse array of sources including pre-established juveniles and resprouts from damaged adults. Both native and non-indigenous vine cover in unmanipulated study areas increased following the hurricane. Non-indigenous vine species had higher cover than native vine species, and many species formed dense 'blankets.' Non-indigenous species in general (not just vines) did not differ significantly from native species in seed mass, nor were they restricted to the pioneer type of life history.

We sought to elucidate general explanations for patterns of richness in terrestrial mollusc communities by analysis of species coexistence and habitat relationships within a New Zealand district fauna. Location: Pukeamaru Ecological District, eastern North Island, New Zealand. Methods: We sampled molluscs using qualitative methods at twenty-three sites and quantitatively by frame sampling of scrubland-forest floor litter at sixteen of these sites and analysed patterns of species richness and turnover in relation to regional species pools and local habitat attributes. We then tested for nonrandom assemblage of taxa along diversity and habitat gradients. Results: Ninety-four indigenous mollusc species were recorded from a district fauna estimated at 102 indigenous species: only two species were endemic. From the presumptive geological history of the district, the low endemism, and Brooks parsimony and indicator species analyses of faunal relationships, the communities were indicated to have resulted by accumulation of colonists from other New Zealand districts since the Miocene. Richness ranged from two or three indigenous species in dune habitats to fifty-nine species in a floristically rich forest. Beta diversity was high and site occupancy per species was low, indicating communities structured by successive replacement of ecological equivalents. Sites differing in vegetation had characteristic species assemblages, indicating a degree of habitat specialization. Canonical correspondence analysis indicated that canopy tree species, canopy height, floristic diversity, altitude, litter mass, and litter pH were important determinants of species assemblage in scrubland and forest.

Monograph,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-17544396119&partnerID=40&md5=6a16ef7f28faa7a61ea4e6c0fd78bb7f,,"Ecologic distribution of brackish-water foraminifera. Census data on 89 species of benthic foraminiferal tests from 131 samples from brackish-water environments throughout New Zealand are analysed by cluster and correspondence analyses. Ten brackish-water faunal associations are recognised. When mapped in study areas they can be seen to inhabit distinct estuarine and tidal inlet environments. The associations are characterised by Trochamminita salsa, Haplophragmoides wilberti, Trochammina inflata, Jadammina macrescens, Miliammina fusca, Elphidium excavatum and Ammonia parkinsoniana, on their own or in combinations. Canonical correspondence analysis indicates that the factors most influential in determining the faunal distribution in brackish environments are, in descending order of importance: salinity, tidal exposure, and presence of intertidal vegetation. Associations characterised by agglutinated species occur in the more extreme brackish-water environments - in the least saline environments and also above mean high water. Ecologic distribution of normal marine salinity foraminifera. Census data on 327 species of benthic foraminiferal tests from 197 samples from shallow-water (<100 m), normal marine environments around New Zealand are analysed by cluster and correspondence analyses. Eighteen faunal associations inhabiting distinct coastal environments are recognised. The associations are characterised by various combinations of species of Elphidium, Haynesina, Pileolina, Rosalina, Gaudryina, Notorotalia, Planoglabratella, Quinqueloculina, Cibicides, Zeaflorilus, Virgulopsis, Patellinella, Nonionellina, Trifarina, Bulimina and Cassidulina. Canonical correspondence analysis indicates that the following factors in decreasing order of importance are most influential in determining the faunal distribution in normal marine environments: factors linked to depth, factors linked to wave and current energy, factors linked to biogeography, bottom water oxygen concentrations and substrate type. Taxonomy. 426 species are listed from shallow-water (<100 m) around New Zealand. The 233 most common or distinctive species are fully illustrated and their diagnostic features outlined. Four new species are described: Glabratellina kermadecensis n.sp., Neoconorbina cavalliensis n.sp., Pileolina gracei n.sp., and Notorotalia hornibrooki n.sp. Frequency of species occurrence. To assess species frequency, species duration and biogeography, we used a data set containing the presence/absence records of 353 species in 50 composite shallow-water localities from around the New Zealand region. The frequency of species occurrence follows a log series curve with 35% of the species occurring rarely (1-2 localities) and 20% occurring commonly (>16 localities). Rotaliinid species have the greatest frequency of occurrence (35% are common), whereas lageninids and textulariinids have the greatest number of rare species (44%, 55%). Unlike reported North American results, there appears to be no significant difference in the percentage of endemic or cosmopolitan species that are rare or common. Species duration. 128 Recent benthic species (36%) have a recorded New Zealand fossil record (50% of rotaliinids, <35% of other suborders). One species first appears in each of the late Cretaceous and Paleocene, 22 in Eocene, 25 in Oligocene, 67 in Miocene, 14 in Pliocene, 4 in Pleistocene, with major influxes in the latest Eocene-early Oligocene, and early Miocene (31 species each). Species with a fossil record have a mean partial species duration of 21 m. yr Deeper water species (live dominantly >100 m) have a longer mean duration (24 m.yr), than dominantly shallow species (20 m. yr) or brackish species (9 m. yr). Commonly occurring species have a far greater percentage with a fossil record (55%) than rarely occurring species (19%). Contrary to findings elsewhere, the rarely occurring species with a fossil record have a longer mean duration (27 m.yr) than the intermediate class (21.5 m.yr) and the common class (15.5 m.yr). 66% of the 50 endemic New Zealand species have a fossil record (mean duration 14 m.yr), whereas only 40% of the 180 cosmopolitan species have a New Zealand fossil record (mean duration 25 m.yr). Biogeography. Fifty percent of our species are cosmopolitan, 14% endemic and 10% have a South-west Pacific distribution. All 21 brackish-restricted species are cosmopolitan. There is one endemic genus (Zeaflorilus) and one third of the endemic species belong to three genera - Notorotalia (7 spp.), Pileolina (5 spp.) and Quinqueloculina (5 spp.). New Zealand appears to be the centre of greatest diversity for the former two genera. 38% of the endemic species occur commonly around New Zealand with many as characterising species of faunal associations - Spiroplectinella proxispira, Elphidium novozealandicum, Nonionellina flemingi, Notorotalia finlayi, Pileolina zealandica, Virgulopsis turris, Zeaflorilus parri. All the New Zealand brackish and mid shelf faunal associations occur overseas, but 13 of the 16 normal marine salinity, inner shelf associations appear to be restricted to New Zealand. Most endemic species are widespread around New Zealand with just 6 having distributions restricted to a single province - Glabratellina kermadecensis (Kermadecian), Discorbinella deflata (Moriorian), Fissurina baccata, Elphidium excavatum f. oirgi, Pileolina calcarata, P. harmeri (Aupourian). A simplified version of the composite locality presence/absence data set on New Zealand's normal marine, shallow-water foraminifera was analysed by clustering Jaccard coefficients. Six mappable biogeographic provinces were identified from the resulting dendrogram - Kermadecian, Aupourian (north-east North Island), New Zealand (most of the three main islands), Fiordland, Moriorian (Chatham Islands) and Antipodean (Subantarctic Islands). These foraminiferal provinces are closely similar to the classic, molluscan-defined marine provinces, except that the classic Cookian and Forsterian Provinces are combined into the New Zealand Province and a separate Fiordland Province is recognised. Another minor difference is that the Far North and Waitemata Harbour are excluded from the foraminiferal Aupourian province and group with the New Zealand Province. The number of shallow-water benthic foraminiferal species present in the Fiordland and outlying island provinces is considerably fewer than in the two mainland provinces, because of less extensive study, reduced range of habitats, less likelihood of successful trans-oceanic dispersal (islands), young age of island group (Kermadecian), or cooler water (Fiordland, Antipodean). Diversity decreases from north to south in the well-studied mainland provinces, with 304 species in Aupourian and 270 in the New Zealand. Thirty warm, shallow-water species are restricted to the Aupourian Province, which is strongly influenced by the warm East Auckland Current, and a further 8 species are restricted to the Aupourian plus the Kermadecian. Few species are restricted to the other provinces - Kermadecian (5), New Zealand (9), Fiordland (0), Moriorian (1) and Antipodean (0). The pattern of brackish-water foraminiferal biogeography in New Zealand differs from that of the normal marine species and appears to be more similar to that displayed by terrestrial plants and animals. Dispersal. Our results show that there are two groups of shallow-water foraminiferal species. One group has been able to rapidly disperse widely around the world, crossing oceanic barriers of up to 1500 km width (Tasman Sea), whereas the other group (including the New Zealand endemics) have not successfully dispersed to other countries. Transport on the feet or feathers of migratory wading seabirds is postulated as the most likely dispersal mechanism for the cosmopolitan brackish foraminiferal fauna. Trans-oceanic current transport of suspended juveniles is the most favoured dispersal mechanism for the majority of the widespread normal marine, shallow-water species, possibly assisted at times by 'island-hopping' across the wider oceanic barriers. We infer from their modern New Zealand distribution patterns that three species (Elphidium vellai, Virgulinella fragilis, Siphogenerina raphana) have been introduced in ships' ballast water within the last century or so. A fourth (Spiroloculina carinata) may also but is less certain. Paleoenvironmental assessment. A multiplicity of physical and biological factors determine the modern ecologic distribution patterns of foraminifera. The correlation of some of these factors with the presence or abundance of certain foraminiferal taxa or associations has been documented in modern faunas and may be used to assess the paleoenvironment of fossil foraminiferal faunas.",Terrestrial biodiversity (Population);,,Monitoring (Outcome);,negative,nan,0,1360,1,GAY9UFPD,journalArticle,2003,"Barré, N.; Bachy, P.",Complement to the list of the birds of New Caledonia,Alauda,,00024619 (ISSN),,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0038672025&partnerID=40&md5=08686e36ebe228a5d4ae2f144e92ed87,"Over the last five years, ten species of birds not previously known on the island have been seen, increasing the number of species/subspecies recorded in New Caledonia to about 192 taxa.

These species are also widely distributed and overlap highly in their spatial extent. The Great Lakes basin includes 35,000 islands that differ in aspects of their geography, geology and climate, but that share a common post-glacial history. This system provides a unique opportunity to assess the relative importance of biotic vs. abiotic factors in the development of nestedness. Our goal was to document and explain the patterns of nestedness across a variety of spatial and taxonomic scales. Location: We studied amphibian and reptile assemblages (forty-five species) occurring on 107 islands among four archipelagoes (Lake Erie, St Lawrence, Georgian Bay, Apostle) in the Laurentian Great Lakes of North America. The entire basin was recolonized in the post-Pleistocene by amphibians and reptiles following the final retreat of the Wisconsin ice sheet. The present configuration of lakes and islands has existed over the past 5000 years. Most islands are landbridges; however, lake level fluctuation in Lake Huron inundated some islands of low relief. Presumably most islands would contain primarily extinction - as opposed to colonization - driven faunas. Methods: We used data from four recent and thorough surveys to construct presence-absence matrices. To quantify nestedness of assemblages we used the nested temperature (T) method. To assess the association of nestedness with area and isolation we used the departures method. To quantify nestedness at the species level we used the Wilcoxon two-sample method. To analyse species richness and patterns of nestedness we used multiple regression, and two-way ANOVA. Results: Islands supported diverse assemblages of both amphibians and reptiles that were in harmony with their mainland species pool(s). We found highly significant nestedness across the entire basin, all archipelagoes and all taxonomic levels. However, the degree of nestedness did not differ significantly among archipelagoes. The degree of nestedness did differ significantly (most to least) among classes (reptiles, amphibians) and orders (snakes, turtles, frogs, salamanders). Patterns of nestedness were more complex at the species level where some species were nested in all archipelagoes, while other species were in some locations but not others. Species richness and nestedness were strongly associated with area but not isolation. Main conclusions: The similarity of the insular and mainland faunas indicate that the entire Great Lakes basin shares virtually the same species pool.

Classified as subgenera of Anaulacus are the following previously described genus-group taxa: Anaulacus (sensu stricto), new status; Aephnidius W. S. MacLeay, 1825, new combination; Caphora Schmidt-Göbel, 1846, new combination; Microus Chaudoir, 1876, new combination; Macracanthus Chaudoir, 1846 (= Ophryognathus Chaudoir, 1876, new junior synonym), new combination; and Odontomasoreus Darlington, 1968, new combination. Primarily a taxonomic review of the Neotropical elements of Anaulacus MacLeay, this paper includes a classification, a key to subgenera and species, descriptions of taxa, re-rankings, and new synonymy. In total, 15 species are treated, seven of which are described as new. The Neotropical taxa are arranged in the following sequence, with type localities of new species in parentheses, following name of the taxon. The new subgenus Apostolus includes only its type species, A. batesi Chaudoir. The eight species of subgenus Aephnidius MacLeay are arranged in three species groups: piceolus group, with only A. piceolus Chaudoir; ampliusculus group, with four species - A. ampliusculus Chaudoir, A. bonariensis Chaudoir, A. ciliatus Mutchler, and A. humeralis, new species (Santa Maria de Dota, Provincia San José, Costa Rica); and exiguus group, with three species -- A. exiguus, new species (15 km. NE Puerto Maldonado, 12°33′S, 69°03′W, Departamento Madre de Dios, Peru), A. whiteheadi, new species (San Quintin, 16°24′N, 69°03′W, State of Chiapas, México); and A. ashei, new species (type locality same as for A. exiguus, above). Three fossil specimens in amber, from the island of Hispaniola, in the Dominican Republic, are assumed to be conspecific with one another, the species to which they belong being included in subgenus Aephnidius, but treated as incertae sedis in relation to the exant members of that subgenus. The six species of subgenus Macracanthus Chaudoir, are arranged in three species groups, as follows: sericatus group, with three species -- A. sericatus Chaudoir, A. thoracicus, new species (Pôrto Alegre, State of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil), and A. erwini, new species (Cocha Shinguito, Rio Samiria, Departamento Loreto, Peru); the mcclevei species group, including only A. mcclevei, new species (17 km SW Moctezuma, State of Sonora, México); and the A. tuberculatus group, including two species -- A. pittieri Gahan, and A. tuberculatus Chaudoir (including A. t. tuberculatus and A. t. brasilianus van Emden, new junior synonym). Generally geophilous, most of the species live at altitudes between sea level and 500 m., in a variety of situations, from tropical evergreen forest, though some live in semi-tropical forests, to dry, open areas. Adults of many of the species fly at night. Most of the species of subgenus Macracanthus are associated in some way with ants of the genus Atta. The species A. (M.) sericatus is a facultative cavernicole, also.

This is done by first reviewing the available literature, and then by focusing on a study in an archipelago of lake islands in northern Sweden. Location: Islands in lakes Uddjaure and Hornavan in the northern Swedish boreal forest. Results: The available literature suggests that islands offer two types of opportunities for investigating how species affect ecosystem properties. The first emerges from the fact that island biotas are often relatively depauperate compared with corresponding continental biotas. This enables the effects of species to be assessed against a less complicated background. The second involves the use of islands as spatially independent replicate ecosystems, which can be used to evaluate the effects of ecosystem drivers over larger spatial scales than is possible through most other approaches that allow proper replication of ecosystems.

The resulting Portrait is an Internet site that presents the current knowledge base of the river's ecological and biological diversity (http://lavoieverte.qc.ec.gc.ca/faune/biodiv/index.html). The Portrait provides information on over 5,000 species of flora and fauna. On the website, you will find a detailed ecological analysis of the richness, rarity and vulnerability of several broad groups of plant and animal species. Furthermore, you will find a list of species for each of the 700 survey units and a distribution map for 2,500 species recorded along the St Lawrence., in atlas form, along with a detailed conservation plan. The plan encompasses the most unique and heterogeneous landscapes of the St Lawrence, some of which have no protection at present. The Portrait provides an overview of the sites that are currently protected by public agencies and private-sector organisations and identifies new sites of interest for conserving biodiversity and protecting species at risk. This paper exposes the content of this extensive compendium on the biodiversity of the St. Lawrence. For conciseness, it presents some of the analyses conducted on birds to illustrate a few of the analytical approaches that were used. Then, the information on species richness and concentration areas for priority species of vascular plants, breeding birds and herpetofauna will serve to identify the terrestrial sites of significance for biodiversity. Finally, a similar approach having been applied to the aquatic environnement, we will conclude with a conservation plan that identifies the terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems, and the geographic sites where the most important elements of St. Lawrence biodiversity are concentrated. Our analysis of the biodiversity of the most thoroughly studied taxa of the St. Lawrence clearly shows the importance of wetlands, particularly those located at the mouths of rivers or within archipelagos or delta complexes, such as the groups of islands and channels found at both ends of the Montréal Archipelago. These aquatic landscapes are sites of intense biological production, combining in a small geographical area spawning, nursery and feeding grounds for a large number of fish species and breeding, rearing and foraging areas for aquatic birds. Variable flooding conditions, associated with seasonal flooding or daily tidal fluctuations, create a complex mosaic of wetland and aquatic habitats. Although wetlands occupy only a small area in comparison with terrestrial habitats, they support a large number of rare plant and animal species in relation to their size. At present, 10% of the vascular flora and 27% of the herpetofauna of the St. Lawrence are at risk. In the case of reptiles and amphibians, the situation is especially worrisome because nearly all of the most threatened species live in a narrow band along the river corridor. Not only is this the sector that is under the greatest pressure from human development, very little public land remains here, making it difficult to create protected areas. Increased participation by non-governmental organisations and individuals, through private stewardship arrangements, is an essential precondition for completing the network of conservation areas in this part of the St. Lawrence. Along the estuary and the Gulf, habitat integrity has not been affected as much by the expansion of Québec's human population. This is a vast territory, and sites have been identified with a view to making up for the deficiencies in the present network of protected sites in terms of representing biodiversity.",,Island (Population);,,negative,10.1023/a:1025564922626,15124,1377,15125,5TI3X7XM,journalArticle,2003,"Desgranges, J.-L.; Jobin, B.","Knowing, mapping and understanding St. Lawrence biodiversity, with special emphasis on bird assemblages",Environmental Monitoring and Assessment,,01676369 (ISSN),10.1023/A:1025564922626,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0141503187&doi=10.1023%2fA%3a1025564922626&partnerID=40&md5=38aba43edb87d8bb7b828ec32565266d,"Environment Canada and the Québec Department of the Environment, partners in the St Lawrence Vision 2000 Action Plan, set out to prepare a compendium of knowledge of the flora and fauna of the St Lawrence and to identify potential conservation sites.

Furthermore, you will find a list of species for each of the 700 survey units and a distribution map for 2,500 species recorded along the St Lawrence., in atlas form, along with a detailed conservation plan. The plan encompasses the most unique and heterogeneous landscapes of the St Lawrence, some of which have no protection at present. The Portrait provides an overview of the sites that are currently protected by public agencies and private-sector organisations and identifies new sites of interest for conserving biodiversity and protecting species at risk. This paper exposes the content of this extensive compendium on the biodiversity of the St. Lawrence. For conciseness, it presents some of the analyses conducted on birds to illustrate a few of the analytical approaches that were used. Then, the information on species richness and concentration areas for priority species of vascular plants, breeding birds and herpetofauna will serve to identify the terrestrial sites of significance for biodiversity. Finally, a similar approach having been applied to the aquatic environnement, we will conclude with a conservation plan that identifies the terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems, and the geographic sites where the most important elements of St. Lawrence biodiversity are concentrated. Our analysis of the biodiversity of the most thoroughly studied taxa of the St. Lawrence clearly shows the importance of wetlands, particularly those located at the mouths of rivers or within archipelagos or delta complexes, such as the groups of islands and channels found at both ends of the Montréal Archipelago. These aquatic landscapes are sites of intense biological production, combining in a small geographical area spawning, nursery and feeding grounds for a large number of fish species and breeding, rearing and foraging areas for aquatic birds. Variable flooding conditions, associated with seasonal flooding or daily tidal fluctuations, create a complex mosaic of wetland and aquatic habitats. Although wetlands occupy only a small area in comparison with terrestrial habitats, they support a large number of rare plant and animal species in relation to their size. At present, 10% of the vascular flora and 27% of the herpetofauna of the St. Lawrence are at risk. In the case of reptiles and amphibians, the situation is especially worrisome because nearly all of the most threatened species live in a narrow band along the river corridor. Not only is this the sector that is under the greatest pressure from human development, very little public land remains here, making it difficult to create protected areas. Increased participation by non-governmental organisations and individuals, through private stewardship arrangements, is an essential precondition for completing the network of conservation areas in this part of the St. Lawrence. Along the estuary and the Gulf, habitat integrity has not been affected as much by the expansion of Québec's human population. This is a vast territory, and sites have been identified with a view to making up for the deficiencies in the present network of protected sites in terms of representing biodiversity.",2003,2025-04-16 10:10:39,2025-04-16 10:10:39,,177-192,,1-3,88,,Environ.

2100,The molecular ecology of antarctic terrestrial and limnetic invertebrates and microbes,"Stevens, M.I.; Hogg, I.D.",2006,Trends in Antarctic Terrestrial and Limnetic Ecosystems: Antarctica as a Global Indicator,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84890010508&doi=10.1007%2f1-4020-5277-4_9&partnerID=40&md5=7a94d4f1f7f2ba5d11f595c442dbe9a3,10.1007/1-4020-5277-4_9,"The Antarctic landscape has been dominated by long-term habitat fragmentation, with less than 1% of the 14 million km2 of the continent ice-free today, and more than 10 major glacial cycles over the last one million years (Hays et al. 1976, Lawver and Gahagan 2003, Roberts et al. 2003). The continental landscape is well known as an extreme environment, but there remains debate about 'when' these conditions became extreme (Miller and Mabin 1998, Roberts et al. 2003). Climate cooling and subsequent glaciation of Antarctica was not possible until both the South Tasman Rise cleared the Oates Land coast of East Antarctica (~32 MYA) and the opening of the Drake Passage to deep water circulation (~28 MYA) (Lawver and Gahagan 2003). However, while the circum-Antarctic currents were sufficient to isolate Antarctica from other continental landmasses, glaciation of Antarctica was not immediate (see also Bergstrom et al. this volume). It is clear from palaeological evidence that a Nothofagus-herb-moss tundra vegetation replaced the Gondwanan forest and persisted in the region until possibly the Pliocene (~2-5 MYA) or late Miocene (~5-12 MYA) (Ashworth and Preece 2003). Furthermore, fossil records suggest that some elements of the terrestrial (eg weevils), and limnetic faunas (eg lymnaeid gastropods, the bivalve Pisidium and at least one species of fish) persisted throughout the Trans-Antarctic Mountains until their extinction in the Pliocene (Ashworth and Kuschel 2003, Ashworth and Preece 2003). This extinct continental fauna evolved during or before the Jurassic, with most achieving global distributions (including Antarctica) by the Cretaceous (Ashworth and Preece 2003). Accordingly, the present-day invertebrate taxa may be relics of this once more abundant and widespread fauna present on the Gondwanan supercontinent. On the Antarctic continent the terrestrial invertebrate fauna is taxonomically limited and consists largely of arthropods, particularly the springtails (Collembola) and mites (Acari) (Hogg and Stevens 2002). However, various flies (Diptera), beetles (Coleoptera), aphids (Homoptera), copepods, isopods, amphipods, annelids and planarians have also been recorded from the maritime regions of the Antarctic Peninsula and subantarctic islands (Gressitt 1964, Balfour-Browne and Tilbrook 1966, Wirth and Gressitt 1967, Gressitt 1970, Richardson and Jackson 1995, Convey and Block 1996, Vernon et al. 1997, Hulle et al. 2003, Winsor and Stevens 2005). Exceptions to this generalisation particularly in limno-terrestrial (sensu McInnes and Pugh 1998) and limnetic systems are the smaller protozoans, tardigrades, rotifers and nematodes (Gressitt 1965, Utsugi and Ohyama 1989, Bullini et al. 1994 Vincent 2000, Treonis et al. 2002, de la Torre et al. 2003, Moorhead et al. 2003, Lawley et al. 2004). Indeed, Wharton (2003) has suggested that nematodes may be the most diverse and abundant invertebrates in both the maritime and continental Antarctic regions. Much of the available information is based on studies documenting and/or describing new species (eg Womersley and Strandtmann 1963, Wise 1967, 1971, Dastych 1984, Greenslade and Wise 1984, 1986, Miller et al. 1988, Greenslade 1995). From the earliest Antarctic expeditions, several reports have described, added to, and revised the inventories of terrestrial, limno-terrestrial and limnetic invertebrates (eg Carpenter 1902, Hunter 1967, Strandtmann 1967, Wise 1967, 1971, Jennings 1976, Miller et al. 1988, Shishida and Ohyama 1989, Utsugi and Ohyama 1989, Potapov 1991). Such inventories have relied on morphology-based taxonomy, which in many cases may not adequately reflect true levels of diversity, or fully scrutinize levels of endemicity, particularly since morphological conservatism is a prevalent feature among many invertebrate taxa (eg Witt et al. 2003). However, until recently these inventories remained the only approach to studying the diversity and taxonomic affinities of Antarctic invertebrates. Fortunately, with increased access to molecular techniques (Gaffney 2000, Sunnucks 2000), the diversity of Antarctic invertebrates can now be assessed at levels previously unattainable. Furthermore, these same techniques can be used to test hypotheses related to connectivity (ie gene flow), and can reveal processes and historical events that shaped the pattern of genetic diversity among populations (phylogeography), in addition to their evolutionary history and relationships to other taxa (phylogeny). This chapter discusses the application of molecular techniques for species identifications and the role of population genetic studies in assessing levels of gene flow/dispersal among habitats. We then continue with a discussion of the phylogenetic relationships of some of the Antarctic fauna and conclude with a summary of future research needs. In keeping with the theme of this volume, we include the terrestrial and limnetic environments. We consider the 'Antarctic' to include the main continental landmass, the Antarctic Peninsula and associated islands and archipelagos (South Shetland, South Orkney, South Sandwich Islands, Bouvetøya), and the ring of 'subantarctic' oceanic islands surrounding the continent at relatively high latitude in the Southern Ocean (Marion Island, Iles Crozet, Iles Kerguelen, Heard Island, Macquarie Island).

Have there been any 'earth-shifting' paradigms developed in the recent past? Antarctica has now clearly been identified as having a major role in processes associated with the Earth System. The role of the formation of Antarctic bottom water as a driver of the thermohaline current is now relatively well understood and its influence on the properties of the world's oceans widely accepted (Foldvik et al. 2004). Antarctica and the Southern Ocean are recognised as major elements in the equation controlling the Earth's climate and weather, and furthermore, the signals of change are acute in some Antarctic locations (Convey this volume). Our understanding of the role of the supercontinent Gondwana and its subsequent breakup in shaping the Earth's biota has increased (McLoughlin 2001), and if anything, there is a developing understanding and realisation that long distance, over-ocean dispersal has actually played a more important role in shaping southern continental and island floras (Munoz et al. 2004, Hughes et al. this volume) than previously thought during the era of recognition of plate tectonics. For example, using modern molecular methods it is now hypothesised that the major lineages in the Poales (sedges and grasses) evolved in separate southern continents (Bremmer 2001). As both groups are widely dispersed in all Gonwanan land masses, but Africa had rifted apart early during angiosperm evolutionary time, over-ocean dispersal must again be considered as a component to the Gondwanan-Antarctic equation. Those subantarctic islands with unbroken oceanic histories provide classic examples of over-ocean, long distance dispersal being responsible for their entire biotas. Palaeostudies of various forms have increased our understanding of the past climate and biological history of the Antarctic region (Bergstrom et al. this volume) and recent ice cores in Antarctica have provided a much needed perspective on recent climatic events. The Antarctic continental ice-sheet developed far later than previously thought, involving a complicated process of ice advance and retreat, but, over the last 480kyr, ice has been the norm, with only 10% of this time spent in interglacials (EPICA 2004). Thus the climate change that Earth is experiencing now must be viewed as a rare event when compared with the last half a million years of the planet's history, and over the last 1Ma there has been greater percentage of icehouse than greenhouse conditions. One of the remarkable features of the Antarctic continent and surrounding islands is that despite the repeated ice-ages, not all land was covered by substantial ice sheets. Thus, there were ice-free refugia. Some localities such as Macquarie Island were too low in elevation for the development of an extensive ice-cap (Selkirk et al. 1990), while other areas, including continental areas, escaped ice cover for other reasons. Regardless of reason, ice-free areas mean habitat available for biota. In fact, not even ice-free land is a prerequisite for life, as the emergence of the study of epishelf lakes, cryoconite holes and sub-glacial lakes over the last 20 years has demonstrated (Priscu et al. 2005, Gibson et al. this volume). The essence of life, as clearly demonstrated by the driest continent on Earth, is liquid water (Convey this volume, Hennion et al. this volume). The loss of liquid water at some sites in Antarctica with current climate change will undoubtedly result in loss of local biodiversity (Convey this volume). Liquid water and ice-free refugia during ice ages has meant long availability of habitat, even extending back to the Gondwana era (Bergstrom et al. this volume). Understanding of colonisation processes and biogeographic patterns has increased markedly over the last 20 years (eg Hughes et al. this volume, Chown and Convey, this volume). The degree of vagility has been identified as an important feature in influencing the distribution patterns of species in the Antarctic region (Greve et al. 2005). Indeed, it has been clearly shown that standard biogeographic factors such as distance between land masses, age, local environmental variables and human impact are as much relevant in the Antarctic region as elsewhere in the world (Chown et al. 1998, Chown and Convey this volume), giving strength to the universality of these principles. Aerobiological (Marshall 1996), cloche (Smith 2001) and molecular genetic studies (Hughes et al. this volume, Skotnicki and Selkirk this volume, Stevens and Hogg this volume) have provided evidence of propagule transport of vagile species to and/or within the Antarctic regions and their subsequent colonisation patterns. A tantalising picture of the survival of non-vagile species in ice-free habitats is emerging however. Pugh (2003) has concluded that some groups of mites are not capable of long-distance dispersal and Bayly et al. (2003) have provided strong argument for the presence of vicariant invertebrates in Antarctica (Gibson et al. this volume). The recent successful extraction for ancient copepod DNA from Antarctic palaeo-samples (Bissett et al. 2005) highlights new and exciting directions for future research. The identification of vicariant Gondwana species in the Antarctic region will allow us to examine what features of species allow survival through multiple 'icehouse/ greenhouse' cycles (Bergstrom et al. this volume). The resounding message of current Antarctic biota, is that of isolation and life at the end of a planetary spectrum of conditions with regard to many variables (Bergstrom et al. this volume, Convey et al. this volume b, Peck et al. 2006). 'Simple' and 'extreme', words commonly used in the past to describe the Antarctic have clearly been shown to be relative terms and perhaps often inappropriate under new terms of reference that have been established. Where there is life in the Antarctic, even under the most extreme of conditions there is a community of sorts, although one of the intriguing components is that, both in terrestrial/freshwater environments and marine, often elements, functional groups or guilds are missing (Bergstrom and Chown 1999, Clarke and Johnston 2003). This fact highlights that Antarctica demonstrates a simple but fundamental concept - that not all ecosystem processes are of equal impact. At this end of the spectrum, environmental factors (mainly chronically low temperatures, availability of liquid water and the various components of solar radiation) generally outweigh the impact of biotic interactions such that selection pressures from these physical environmental factors are strong (Bergstrom et al. this volume, Convey et al. this volume b). Results of these selection pressures include the presentation of life history strategies with features such as stress tolerance, lack of competitive ability or investment in dispersal strategies, reduced reproductive investment and output in some groups, and extended lifespans and life cycles. But more generally, a key element in the response of many Antarctic terrestrial and freshwater biota to environmental variation is the possession of considerable flexibility in many life history and physiological characteristics (Convey et al. this volume b, Hennion et al. this volume). With increases in the temperature component of current climate change in many locations of the Antarctic, many terrestrial species may respond positively by faster metabolic rates, shorter life cycles and local expansion of populations. But subtle negative impacts can also be predicted (and are perhaps being observed) with regard to increased exposure to UV-B (Convey this volume, Hennion et al. this volume, Robinson et al. 2005). Changes in water availability will also impact on both terrestrial and the more the stable, limnetic environments. Local reduction in water availability in terrestrial habitats can lead to desiccation stress (Convey this volume) and subsequent changes in ecosystem structure, as has been reported from Marion Island where there have been dramatic changes in mire communities associated with a substantial decrease in rainfall (Smith 2002). Changes in both temperature and precipitation, even changes judged as subtle by climate scientists, will probably have profound effects on limnetic ecosystems through the alteration of the surrounding landscape and of the time, depth and extent of surface ice cover, water body volume and lake chemistry (with increased solute transport from the land in areas of increased melt) (Quesada et al. this volume, Lyons et al. this volume, Quayle et al. 2002, 2003). © 2006 Springer.",,,Monitoring (Outcome);,negative,10.1007/1-4020-5277-4_16,12956,2147,12957,5GUZ5E9Y,journalArticle,2006,"Bergstrom, D.M.; Huiskes, A.H.L.; Convey, P.","The ant arctic: Local signals, global messages",Trends in Antarctic Terrestrial and Limnetic Ecosystems: Antarctica as a Global Indicator,,1402052766 (ISBN); 978-140205276-7 (ISBN),10.1007/1-4020-5277-4_16,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84889960465&doi=10.1007%2f1-4020-5277-4_16&partnerID=40&md5=c67c4235798d72da995c441cd821ac6f,"Twenty years after John Pickard summed up the complexity of the Antarctic region in this simple yet deeply profound statement, it is appropriate to ponder whether the situation has changed: how has our understanding of the bottom end of the Earth improved?

Antarctica and the Southern Ocean are recognised as major elements in the equation controlling the Earth's climate and weather, and furthermore, the signals of change are acute in some Antarctic locations (Convey this volume). Our understanding of the role of the supercontinent Gondwana and its subsequent breakup in shaping the Earth's biota has increased (McLoughlin 2001), and if anything, there is a developing understanding and realisation that long distance, over-ocean dispersal has actually played a more important role in shaping southern continental and island floras (Munoz et al. 2004, Hughes et al. this volume) than previously thought during the era of recognition of plate tectonics. For example, using modern molecular methods it is now hypothesised that the major lineages in the Poales (sedges and grasses) evolved in separate southern continents (Bremmer 2001). As both groups are widely dispersed in all Gonwanan land masses, but Africa had rifted apart early during angiosperm evolutionary time, over-ocean dispersal must again be considered as a component to the Gondwanan-Antarctic equation. Those subantarctic islands with unbroken oceanic histories provide classic examples of over-ocean, long distance dispersal being responsible for their entire biotas. Palaeostudies of various forms have increased our understanding of the past climate and biological history of the Antarctic region (Bergstrom et al. this volume) and recent ice cores in Antarctica have provided a much needed perspective on recent climatic events. The Antarctic continental ice-sheet developed far later than previously thought, involving a complicated process of ice advance and retreat, but, over the last 480kyr, ice has been the norm, with only 10% of this time spent in interglacials (EPICA 2004). Thus the climate change that Earth is experiencing now must be viewed as a rare event when compared with the last half a million years of the planet's history, and over the last 1Ma there has been greater percentage of icehouse than greenhouse conditions. One of the remarkable features of the Antarctic continent and surrounding islands is that despite the repeated ice-ages, not all land was covered by substantial ice sheets. Thus, there were ice-free refugia. Some localities such as Macquarie Island were too low in elevation for the development of an extensive ice-cap (Selkirk et al. 1990), while other areas, including continental areas, escaped ice cover for other reasons. Regardless of reason, ice-free areas mean habitat available for biota. In fact, not even ice-free land is a prerequisite for life, as the emergence of the study of epishelf lakes, cryoconite holes and sub-glacial lakes over the last 20 years has demonstrated (Priscu et al. 2005, Gibson et al. this volume). The essence of life, as clearly demonstrated by the driest continent on Earth, is liquid water (Convey this volume, Hennion et al. this volume). The loss of liquid water at some sites in Antarctica with current climate change will undoubtedly result in loss of local biodiversity (Convey this volume). Liquid water and ice-free refugia during ice ages has meant long availability of habitat, even extending back to the Gondwana era (Bergstrom et al. this volume). Understanding of colonisation processes and biogeographic patterns has increased markedly over the last 20 years (eg Hughes et al. this volume, Chown and Convey, this volume). The degree of vagility has been identified as an important feature in influencing the distribution patterns of species in the Antarctic region (Greve et al. 2005). Indeed, it has been clearly shown that standard biogeographic factors such as distance between land masses, age, local environmental variables and human impact are as much relevant in the Antarctic region as elsewhere in the world (Chown et al. 1998, Chown and Convey this volume), giving strength to the universality of these principles. Aerobiological (Marshall 1996), cloche (Smith 2001) and molecular genetic studies (Hughes et al. this volume, Skotnicki and Selkirk this volume, Stevens and Hogg this volume) have provided evidence of propagule transport of vagile species to and/or within the Antarctic regions and their subsequent colonisation patterns. A tantalising picture of the survival of non-vagile species in ice-free habitats is emerging however. Pugh (2003) has concluded that some groups of mites are not capable of long-distance dispersal and Bayly et al. (2003) have provided strong argument for the presence of vicariant invertebrates in Antarctica (Gibson et al. this volume). The recent successful extraction for ancient copepod DNA from Antarctic palaeo-samples (Bissett et al. 2005) highlights new and exciting directions for future research. The identification of vicariant Gondwana species in the Antarctic region will allow us to examine what features of species allow survival through multiple 'icehouse/ greenhouse' cycles (Bergstrom et al. this volume). The resounding message of current Antarctic biota, is that of isolation and life at the end of a planetary spectrum of conditions with regard to many variables (Bergstrom et al. this volume, Convey et al. this volume b, Peck et al. 2006). 'Simple' and 'extreme', words commonly used in the past to describe the Antarctic have clearly been shown to be relative terms and perhaps often inappropriate under new terms of reference that have been established. Where there is life in the Antarctic, even under the most extreme of conditions there is a community of sorts, although one of the intriguing components is that, both in terrestrial/freshwater environments and marine, often elements, functional groups or guilds are missing (Bergstrom and Chown 1999, Clarke and Johnston 2003). This fact highlights that Antarctica demonstrates a simple but fundamental concept - that not all ecosystem processes are of equal impact. At this end of the spectrum, environmental factors (mainly chronically low temperatures, availability of liquid water and the various components of solar radiation) generally outweigh the impact of biotic interactions such that selection pressures from these physical environmental factors are strong (Bergstrom et al. this volume, Convey et al. this volume b). Results of these selection pressures include the presentation of life history strategies with features such as stress tolerance, lack of competitive ability or investment in dispersal strategies, reduced reproductive investment and output in some groups, and extended lifespans and life cycles. But more generally, a key element in the response of many Antarctic terrestrial and freshwater biota to environmental variation is the possession of considerable flexibility in many life history and physiological characteristics (Convey et al. this volume b, Hennion et al. this volume). With increases in the temperature component of current climate change in many locations of the Antarctic, many terrestrial species may respond positively by faster metabolic rates, shorter life cycles and local expansion of populations. But subtle negative impacts can also be predicted (and are perhaps being observed) with regard to increased exposure to UV-B (Convey this volume, Hennion et al. this volume, Robinson et al. 2005). Changes in water availability will also impact on both terrestrial and the more the stable, limnetic environments. Local reduction in water availability in terrestrial habitats can lead to desiccation stress (Convey this volume) and subsequent changes in ecosystem structure, as has been reported from Marion Island where there have been dramatic changes in mire communities associated with a substantial decrease in rainfall (Smith 2002). Changes in both temperature and precipitation, even changes judged as subtle by climate scientists, will probably have profound effects on limnetic ecosystems through the alteration of the surrounding landscape and of the time, depth and extent of surface ice cover, water body volume and lake chemistry (with increased solute transport from the land in areas of increased melt) (Quesada et al. this volume, Lyons et al. this volume, Quayle et al. 2002, 2003). © 2006 Springer.",2006,2025-04-16 10:11:45,2025-04-16 10:11:45,,341-347,,,,,Trends in Antarctic Terrestrial and Limnetic Ecosyst.: Antarctica as a Global Indicat.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Publisher: Springer Netherlands,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.0077,0.001-0.028,0.01,100.00%

Low lake levels are assumed to have caused the BIA to be attached to mainland Michigan for at least 4000 years (10000 yr B.P.- 6000 yr B.P.), eventually, rising lake levels would have kept the islands isolated since 6000 yr B.P. If the island populations of a plant species in the BIA were indeed once continuous with the mainland of Michigan, then we would expect similar levels of genetic diversity in populations of such a species on the islands vs. the mainland. We compared levels of allozyme genetic diversity of 20 plots of Pinus strobus in the BIA with two mainland populations in northern Michigan. In addition, if pollen is a primary agent of gene flow across islands, a low degree of allozyme differentiation among the island populations of P. strobus in the BIA would be evident. Furthermore, since seed dispersal is more limited than pollen dispersal in P. strobus, a more pronounced spatial genetic structure (SGS) is expected in allozymes than in cpDNA markers. To gain insights on the pattern of seed and pollen dispersal among the 20 plots, we further analyzed spatial autocorrelation using Moran's I-statistics for both data sets [biparentally inherited, allozymes and paternally inherited, cpDNA microsatellites (cpDNA SSR)]. We found a similar level of allozyme variability in both the BIA (mean H e = 0.080) and the two mainland populations (mean H e = 0.078). As predicted, we observed a low but significant degree of genetic divergence among populations for allozymes (mean F ST = 0.033 across 20 plots). Our allozyme-based SGS analysis revealed significant evidence of SGS (i.e. isolation-by-distance; slope β = -0.194 from regression analysis of observed averaged Moran's I values against the logarithm of the upper bound of six distance classes). In contrast, little evidence of SGS was found in cpDNA SSR data across the BIA (β = 0.013).

In the present study, we considered the Mediterranean basin islands as an excellent study region to test how the same invasive species perform in different habitats within a single island, and to scale up differences among islands with similar climate. We tested how the performance of three widespread plant invaders with clonal growth but contrasting life-history traits, a deciduous tree Ailanthus altissima, a succulent subshrub Carpobrotus spp., and an annual geophyte Oxalis pes-caprae, varied depending upon the species identity, habitat, and invaded island.

Three different taphonomic pathways are recognized in the fossil assemblages. The oldest bone remains are found redeposited in glacial or glaciofluvial sediments belonging to the repeated advances and retreats of the Weichselian glaciers. The younger remains, which date to the time after the last glacial events (younger than ca. 17-16 kyr BP), are found in situ in lacustrine, fluviatile or marine sediments either in natural deposits or in man-made refuse deposits. In all, 77 terrestrial and marine mammal species have been identified and described in detail as regards first and last appearance data (FAD and LAD), number of dated remains (NDR) and the inferred time range in the Danish/south Scandinavian area. Analyses of the data show that the central European mammoth steppe fauna expanded northward into southern Scandinavia during all Weichselian interstadials. The dynamics of the fauna match the advances and retreats of the ice cap and are best explained as a combination of expansions and local extinctions of marginal populations. After the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) a dramatic increase in species richness is seen between 15 and 11 cal. kyr BP followed by a decline towards a more moderate level between 11 and 9 kyr and a steady state in the last 9000 years with a mean richness of ca. 30 species. Two opposing processes, colonizations and extinctions, regulate the diversity and this also caused large changes in species composition with faunal turnover rates of 90% to 60% during the first 4000 years and 20% to 4% during the last 6000 years. These changes are analysed in relation to the climateinduced environmental changes and increasing human impact. It is shown that the expansion of herbivore populations was controlled by the rate of 'habitat migration' -the time lag in vegetational response to the climatic improvement and furthermore that the Younger Dryas setback induced a local extinction of several species around 12.6 cal. kyr BP. The large number of species (38) forming the peak during the 15 to 11 kyr interval was a mixture of species today considered as ecologically incompatible. The assemblages are referred to as a non-analogue or disharmonious fauna and it is explained as the result of individualistic responses by the species in accordance with their individual tolerance limits during environmental changes. Man-made habitat fragmentations after the introduction of agriculture and husbandry around 6000 BP and a steady increase in encounters with and persecution by a growing human population led to extinctions. At the same time, however, new species were attracted by the new open cultural landscape and by human habitations and activities. The transformation of continental Denmark into a group of islands and peninsulas around 8 cal. kyr BP led to further habitat fragmentations and to isolated and vulnerable island populations. An impoverished fauna is documented on the island of Sjælland which experienced a local extinction of four carnivores and two ungulates during the interval 8 to 7 kyr. The marine mammals are represented by 15 whale species, four true seals, the walrus and the polar bear. The oldest remains belong to cold-adapted species which were present in northern Denmark whenever an arctic-subarctic palaeo-Kattegat-Skagerrak existed during the Weichselian.

2745,Towards a mechanistic understanding of urbanization's impacts on fish,"Wolter, C.",2008,Urban Ecology: An International Perspective on the Interaction Between Humans and Nature,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84860851348&doi=10.1007%2f978-0-387-73412-5_28&partnerID=40&md5=a9e757efc6c60ef324bad5e86692ed11,10.1007/978-0-387-73412-5_28,"Human population is increasing at a rate of 1.8% per year and urbanization is a global trend. In 2005, there were 3.2 billion urban residents worldwide, representing 49% of the global population (UN 2006). The urban population is projected to increase to 4 billion in 2018 and to more than 5 billion in 2030 (UN 2006). However, in the developed regions 75% of the population lived in urban settlements in 2005. This proportion is expected to increase in Europe from 72% in 2005 to 78% in 2030 and in North America from 81% at present to 87% in 2030 (UN 2006). Urban areas cover only 2.4% on the terrestrial surface of Earth, but their average population density is 52 times that of rural areas (MA 2005). Except coastal areas and island states, the highest average urban population density was found along inland waters with 817 people per km2 (MA 2005). Indeed, most people believe that urban environmental conditions are deteriorating, and the condition of urban waters is high on their list of worries. Features of urbanization have been reviewed by Paul & Meyer (2001): impervious surface covers, alteration of drainage density and flow dynamics, decreasing groundwater renewing and sediment supply, and increases in surface runoff, water temperature, pollutants, and nutrients. The cumulative effect of various human activities in urban areas profoundly influence urban waters and their biota, either directly by channel modification and habitat degradation or indirectly by land use change and runoff (Booth et al. 2004). The percentage of impervious surface cover has been commonly suggested as the best single predictor of the response of stream biota to urbanization (e.g. Karr & Chu 2000, Allan 2004, Booth et al. 2004, Miltner et al. 2004). However, the threshold values for demonstrated significant biological degradations at the catchment level of 10-15% total impervious area are much below the commonly observed >50% impervious cover in metropolitan areas at the regional level (Booth et al. 2004). Karr & Chu (2000) considered biological communities as irreparably damaged if the impervious cover within a watershed ranged between 25-60%. Urbanization is highly positively correlated with both the endangerment of native and the invasion of non-native fish within watersheds and thus, considered as major cause of biotic homogenization (Marchetti et al. 2006). Urbanization tends to favour the persistence of relatively few intolerant, generalist native species, the introduction and establishment of widespread non-natives, and the extinction and extirpation of specialized, intolerant native species (Marchetti et al. 2006). But how do urbanized areas and impervious covers impact fish and promote non-native species? What are the basic mechanisms? Non-linear relations between impervious cover and biological communities have been observed, in particular if instream habitats or hydrodynamics were also considered. For example, in Ohio watersheds at sites with relatively undeveloped riparian buffers, the biological integrity was maintained despite high levels of urban land use (Miltner et al. 2004). Accordingly, habitat destruction caused by urban development seemed the primary force driving common species to decline due to resource limitations and enabling different or new species to increase when benefiting from the changed habitats. To analyse this question, between 1992 and 2002 the fish assemblages of 27 Federal waterways have been extensively studied: more than 470 sites were surveyed, 2,100 samples collected, and 336,500 fish recorded representing 35 species. This data set revealed substantial findings on environmental factors structuring local fish assemblages (Wolter & Vilcinskas 1997a, 1998a, Wolter 2000, 2003), environmental pressures (Wolter 2001a, Arlinghaus et al. 2002), urban gradients (Wolter 1997b, 2000, Wolter 1999a), the impact of urbanization on fish abundance (Wolter & Vilcinskas 1996,Wolter 2001b) and population dynamics (Wolter 1998, 1999b, Wolter & Vilcinskas 1998b), and the ecological performance of species (Wolter & Vilcinskas 1997b, Arlinghaus & Wolter 2003). This paper refers briefly to three main results of the mentioned studies to illustrate the specifics of fish communities in urban waters for the example of the water system of Berlin, Germany, where 3.5 million people reside.

To investigate the forces driving current gene-flow patterns and past evolutionary histories, we searched for common patterns of population genetic subdivision within eight species sampled throughout their distributions [mitchochondrial DNA (mtDNA) control region, n = 1086]. We hypothesised that common phylogeographical and population differentiation patterns would reveal past or ongoing physical processes, with differences reflecting stochastic or species-specific processes. Striking differences between species were apparent, with strong phylogeographical structure detected in Grahamina capito and the estuarine species G. nigripenne. G. capito fell into three distinct geographically restricted lineages. G. nigripenne largely separated into northern and southern lineages (ΦST 0.834). Strong population structuring and isolation by distance was evident in Bellapiscis medius, B. lesleyae and Forsterygion lapillum (ΦST 0.686, 0.436 and 0.115, respectively). High gene flow was apparent in G. gymnota and Ruanoho whero, and F. varium. However, for the latter species, isolation was apparent with samples collected from the offshore Three Kings Islands. Overall, a strong relationship was found between habitat depth and population structure among species, and species inhabiting shallower water habitats showed lower genetic diversity with higher levels of population subdivision.

The captured small mammals belonged to 13 species, 9 genera, 3 families and 2 orders, including 10 species of murids (Muridae) , 1 species of cricetid ( Cricetida ) and 2 species of soricids ( Soricdae ). The results showed that there were significant between-season differences in the diversity index, evenness index, and dominance index, and the preponderant species changed among the 14 islands as well. Through an analysis of stepwise linear regression on factors that could influence species diversity on islands such as area, distance to the nearest mainland, distance to the nearest bigger island and plant species richness, we discovered that only plant species richness had significant effect on the species richness of small mammals. The 16 sample sites were classified by the constituent proportion of species, with Xuyuan and 14 islands being the same category, and Yaojia the separated one. This result was also supported by the similarity index. Our conclusions are ( 1 ) in Qiandao Lake, habitat fragmentation has resulted in a decline of ecosystem stability yielding dramatic seasonal changes in species diversity ; ( 2 ) with the increase of island size, the species richness of the small mammals doesn ' t always increase but shows a small island effect; (3) Xuyuan and 14 islands had been a continuous habitat before the reservoir was formed because the proportion of species within the communities was similar in these two regions.

We also tested a third hypothesis, which incorporated assumptions about the origin of exotic plants and their interaction with native plants. Of the three hypotheses we tested, the hypothesis that included exotic species best explained the diversity of the native plant community. The MacArthur-Wilson model of island biogeography did not explain the diversity of native (R2 = 0.13) or exotic plants well (R2 = 0.11), and the model fit the data poorly. A model of environmental variables better explained the diversity of native (R2 = 0.48) and exotic plants (R2 = 0.57), but it also fit the data poorly. Instead, proximity to a railroad explained the cover (R2 = 0.59) and richness of exotic plants (R2 = 0.63), which then explained the species richness of native plants (R2 = 0.34), and the model fit was adequate and had the lowest AIC value. This suggests that the transportation corridor had a significant, though indirect, effect on the native plant community, even in this undisturbed area. Moreover, explained variance, model fit, and the AIC model selection criteria favored the model with the railroad and exotic species over the M-W and environmental models. Since the habitat patches we studied were largely undisturbed by people and their activities, our results further suggest that the transportation corridor influenced the distribution of exotic plants by serving as a vector for colonization, rather than as a source of disturbance. Additionally, the results suggest that exotic plant species have had a negative effect on the diversity of the native plant community and have changed its composition. The results also support the inference that the nascent exotic plant community is influenced by source-sink (Pulliam in Am Nat 132:652-661, 1988) and assembly dynamics.

Until recently, however, the ties between ecology and speciation in plants have received relatively little attention. This paper reviews some exciting new insights into the role of ecology in speciation, focusing on the angiosperms. I consider five main topics, including (1) the determinants of the spatial scale of genetic differentiation within species; (2) the role and limits of adaptive radiation in increasing net rates of plant diversification; (3) the potential role of ecological speciation; (4) the contributions of hybridization to speciation, adaptive radiation, and the ecological breadth of clades; and (5) the ecological determinants of net diversification rate for individual lineages, and of the species richness for regional floras. Limited dispersal, especially of seeds, favors genetic differentiation at small spatial scales and is likely to foster rapid speciation and narrow endemism. Meta-analyses show that the minimum area required for in situ speciation on islands increases with the spatial scale of gene flow in various organisms. In angiosperms, fleshy fruits dispersed by vertebrates often increase the distance over which seeds are dispersed, but can decrease it in forest understories. Nutrient-poor soils should work against the evolution of fleshy fruits and promote speciation and narrow endemism. Selection for adaptation to different conditions drives adaptive radiation, the rise of a diversity of ecological roles and attendant adaptations within a lineage. On islands, adaptive radiation often leads to woodiness, monocarpy, developmental heterophylly, and sexual dimorphism, as well as differences in habitat, growth form, and floral morphology. Adaptive radiation appears to accelerate speciation in only some plant clades. Extensive radiation in some lineages has been ascribed to early colonization, large amounts of heritable genetic variation, ""genetic lines of least resistance"" upon which selection could act, absence of potential competitors, and possession of ""key innovations"" that provide access to novel resources. To these should be added large island area, organismal abundance, saturation of ecological space, and the synergism action of limited dispersal and divergent selection producing parallel radiations in isolated regions. Data for Hawaiian lobeliads suggest that within-island species richness of Cyanea-involving divergence in elevation and flower tube length-saturates within 0.6 and 1.5 Ma. Adaptive radiation in pollinators is an important mechanism of ecological speciation: adaptation to different pollinators leads to pollinator partitioning and reproductive isolation. Selection for longer nectar spurs and pollinator mouth parts led to increased speciation in Aquilegia and other groups. A similar process may work once tubular flowers evolve from cup-shaped blossoms. Selection for floral divergence may be limited in forest understories illuminated by dim, greenish light, which may account for the predominance of small, visually inconspicuous flowers in temperate and tropical understory species. Hybridization can stimulate speciation by forming transgressive phenotypes that exceed the range seen in parental taxa, and by introgressing adaptive gene combinations. The likelihood of transgressive phenotypes increases with the genetic divergence between parental taxa, so speciation via transgressive hybridization may be most likely among taxa with intermediate amounts of divergence. Several large adaptive radiations appear to have occurred after hybridization, suggesting a special role for the extensive amount of genetic variation that can be supplied and refreshed by syngameons. Rates of net species diversification are greater in herbs (especially annuals) vs. woody plants; in animal- vs. wind-pollinated species; in plants with poorly dispersed seeds; in families with a greater diversity of growth forms, pollination and seed dispersal mechanisms, and species distributions; in families at lower latitudes; in families with higher rates of genetic evolution; in hermaphroditic or monoecious vs. dioecious clades; in earlier-maturing woody plants; in plants with bilateral vs. radial flowers; in plants with hummingbird-pollinated flowers; in epiphytic vs. terrestrial bromeliads and orchids; in bromeliads differentiating along geographically extensive cordilleras; and in young vs. old clades. Evidence for the last pattern may, however, be an artifact of (auto)regressing (ln N) / t vs. t. High rates of diversification in epiphytic orchids are tied to small effective population sizes, suggesting a role for intermittent genetic drift alternating with strong selection on floral traits. Across angiosperms, a massive increase in diversification rates was preceded by a major increase in leaf vein density and hydraulic conductance between 140 and 110 Ma ago, leading to higher photosynthetic rates than coexisting ferns and gymnosperms. Based on the economic theory of plant defense, this should have led to lower allocation to anti-herbivore defenses, selecting for low-cost qualitative toxins rather than all-purpose but highly expensive qualitative defenses, triggering an arms' race between angiosperm and their herbivores. Finally, regional plant species richness increases with regional area and proxies for latitude, rainfall, topographic heterogeneity, and vegetation stratification.

3337,"Termite diversity and abundance across fire-induced habitat variability in a tropical moist savanna (lamto, central Côte d'Ivoire)","Dosso, K.; Konaté, S.; Aidara, D.; Linsenmair, K.E.",2010,Journal of Tropical Ecology,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-77952532223&doi=10.1017%2fS0266467410000015&partnerID=40&md5=44f80e59254e6d1ddad83afad43b6fbb,10.1017/S0266467410000015,"At Lamto, little is known about animal community responses to habitat variability resulting from fires and the mosaic pattern of the vegetation in general and in particular about that of termites which play key roles in this ecosystem. With a standardized method, data were collected on termites from four habitats differing in their vegetation cover and fire-history: annually burned savanna, savanna woodland, forest island and gallery forest. A range of environmental variables was measured and correlated with species abundances. The number of termite species collected in the savanna woodland was very close to that found in the gallery forest while the forest island was the richest habitat. The species richness of the savanna woodland and forest island seemed partly due to their heterogeneous and transitional vegetation structures and variable food resources. With regard to the fire-history of habitats, Connell's intermediate disturbance hypothesis offers an explanation for differences in the patterns of habitat-specific species richness. Variation in species abundances was significantly correlated with only two environmental variables (soil pH and woody plant species richness). The pH appeared as the most influential factor for fungus-growers while tree invasion in the savanna strongly reduces the abundance of grass-feeding species (e.g. Trinervitermes geminatus). Although not significantly correlated with species abundances, soil carbon showed a positive correlation with the dominant soil-feeder Basidentitermes potens.

With a standardized method, data were collected on termites from four habitats differing in their vegetation cover and fire-history: annually burned savanna, savanna woodland, forest island and gallery forest. A range of environmental variables was measured and correlated with species abundances. The number of termite species collected in the savanna woodland was very close to that found in the gallery forest while the forest island was the richest habitat. The species richness of the savanna woodland and forest island seemed partly due to their heterogeneous and transitional vegetation structures and variable food resources. With regard to the fire-history of habitats, Connell's intermediate disturbance hypothesis offers an explanation for differences in the patterns of habitat-specific species richness. Variation in species abundances was significantly correlated with only two environmental variables (soil pH and woody plant species richness). The pH appeared as the most influential factor for fungus-growers while tree invasion in the savanna strongly reduces the abundance of grass-feeding species (e.g. Trinervitermes geminatus). Although not significantly correlated with species abundances, soil carbon showed a positive correlation with the dominant soil-feeder Basidentitermes potens. As for wood-feeders, they were not strongly correlated with woody plant species richness; this fact might be linked to their use for other sources of nourishment. Overall, it appears that habitat variability in the Lamto reserve contributes to the maintenance of different subsets of the termite community.

3630,An appeal to protect and restore exposed riverine sediments (ERS) in North America,"Ulyshen, M.D.; Horn, S.",2011,"Stream Restoration: Halting Disturbances, Assisted Recovery and Managed Recovery",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84892055658&partnerID=40&md5=a1c070a107df928cd7892180b0092109,,"Exposed riverine sediments (ERS) are relatively un-vegetated deposits of gravel, sand, silt or some combination found within the stream channel. These habitats support diverse disturbance-adapted arthropod faunas, including both specialist and opportunistic species, and are therefore important in maintaining riparian biodiversity. Because ERS habitat heterogeneity is essential in maintaining diverse arthropod faunas, anthropogenic stream modifications that alter the complexity and hydrological regime of streams have detrimental effects. Many species in Europe have gone extinct, at least regionally, and many others have become highly threatened. Though less well studied, there are some troubling indications that North American ERS arthropods are facing a similar crisis. While restoring ERS habitats should be possible, the lack of previous survey data will make it difficult to monitor arthropod community recovery. Therefore, protecting ERS habitats from further degradation should be a top priority. Riparian habitats are becoming increasingly imperiled worldwide from anthropogenic modifications that include dams and levees, channelization, deforestation, erosion and sediment removal, to name a few. Of particular concern are exposed riverine sediments (ERS), relatively un-vegetated deposits of gravel, sand, silt or some combination found within the stream channel. Studies from Europe demonstrate that ERS support diverse disturbance-adapted arthropod faunas, including both specialist and opportunistic species, and are therefore important in maintaining riparian biodiversity. For example, an estimated 3.5% of all beetle species in Britain are ERS specialists [Sadler et al. 2004, and references therein]. In addition, ERS faunas are dominated by predators (e.g., ground beetles (Carabidae), rove beetles (Staphylinidae), spiders, etc.), many of which prey largely or exclusively on aquatic insects [Hering et al. 1997; Hering 1998; Paetzold et al. 2005], thereby performing the important function of linking aquatic and terrestrial food webs. While the importance of ERS has been well documented in Europe, research in other regions, including North America, is largely lacking. Here we review the current literature on arthropods and exposed riverine sediments for the purpose of raising awareness among researchers outside of Europe, particularly in North America, about these important habitats. A number of features vary among and within ERS, with important implications for arthropod diversity and community composition. Wider patches of ERS contain wider moisture and elevation gradients and support more species than smaller patches [Bates et al. 2007b]. The faunas of mid-channel patches (e.g., islands) likely differ from those of shoreline patches due to differences in accessibility as well as to differences in temperature and humidity (e.g., shoreline patches are often more shaded). ERS duration, determined by flood frequency, governs the extent to which plants become established, with significant effects on arthropod community composition [Eyre et al. 2001; Sadler et al. 2004; Lambeets et al. 2008]. Sediment type and particle size distribution are also important determinants of arthropod community composition [Eyre et al. 2001; Manderbach and Hering 2001], both varying among streams due to differences in geology and within streams due to differences in current velocity (Sadler et al. 2004). Andersen and Hanssen (2005) distinguish between ""lithophilous"" species on sites with stones and/or gravel and ""psammophilous"" species on sites consisting of pure sand. The finest sediments (i.e., silt) support distinct communities as well [Sadler et al. 2004; Lambeets et al. 2008]. Finally, dead wood and other plant material [Loeser et al. 2006] are common riparian features in many regions, further enhancing structural complexity and resource availability on ERS. Because ERS habitat heterogeneity is essential in maintaining diverse arthropod faunas, anthropogenic stream modifications that alter the complexity and hydrological regime of streams can be expected to have severe detrimental effects. Channelization (e.g., dredging, straightening) is perhaps the most damaging of all, virtually eliminating ERS from streams [Eyre et al. 2001]. Dams are also highly disruptive, flooding waterways upstream and simplifying flow patterns downstream, reducing ERS dynamism and promoting plant growth [Bonn et al. 2002; Sadler et al. 2004, and references therein]. Stream hydrology is particularly altered near hydroelectric plants [Paetzold et al. 2008]. By reducing stream flow, dams also result in increased silt deposition [Eyre et al. 2001]. Erosion and sediment extraction alter sediment type and particle size distribution. Deforestation changes shoreline temperature and humidity and affects inputs of wood and other plant material. Livestock trampling and defecation reduce ERS habitat quality in many regions [Sadler et al. 2004; Bates et al. 2007a]. Additional factors contributing to ERS degradation are urbanization, runoff pollutants, and recreational activities (e.g., all-terrain vehicles). Unaltered streams are becoming increasingly rare around the world, yet few efforts have been made to assess the status of ERS arthropods in most regions. The available data from Europe, the best-studied region, are sobering, underscoring the vulnerability of this diverse fauna. Some species are already extinct, at least regionally, whereas many others have become highly imperiled [Andersen and Hanssen 2005]. For example, nearly 20% of the beetle species captured on ERS in Britain by Sadler et al. (2004) were of conservation concern. Though less well studied, there are some troubling indications that North American ERS arthropods are facing a similar crisis. For example, two tiger beetles (Carabidae: Cicindelinae) dependent on streamside sandbars, Cicindela hirticollis abrupta and Cicindela puritana, are presumably extinct and threatened, respectively, as a consequence of flow regulation [Omland 2002; Knisley and Fenster 2005]. Because few efforts have been made to inventory arthropods occurring on ERS in North America, little is known about community composition and even less about the conservation status of the constituent species. For example, in a recent survey of ground beetles on ERS in Georgia, the most frequently captured species by far, Brachinus janthinipennis, was not previously known from the state [Horn and Ulyshen 2009].Few streams in North America remain unaltered. In the United States, for example, a country with over 80,000 dams and extensively degraded riparian forests, only 2% of rivers are considered ""unimpacted"" (Palmer et al. 2007 and sources therein). While extensive surveys are needed before conservations plans can be developed for North American ERS arthropods, steps should be taken in the meantime, when possible, to protect and restore ERS habitats. ERS are less complex than many imperiled ecosystems and should be less difficult to restore. However, while arthropods are disturbance-adapted and frequently exhibit high recolonization potential, some species are less resilient [Hering et al. 2004] and the lack of previous survey data will make it difficult to monitor arthropod community recovery. Consequently, protecting ERS habitats from further degradation should be a top priority. © 2010 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

The results show that 495 species belonging to 145 families and 342 genera were recorded in the six ecological safety islands, which have a total area of 3.238hm2. Among the 495 recorded species, 30 species are ferns belonging to 19 families and 15 genera; 10 species are gymnosperms belonging to 6 families and 8 genera; 90 species are monocotyledon belonging to 27 families and 68 genera; 365 species are dicotyledon belonging to 93 families and 241 genera. The geographical elements of the genera are mainly composed of tropical and subtropical types. In addition, 7 rare and endangered species belonging to 6 families and 7 genera were recorded, which fall into different protection grades. The rare and endangered species were mainly found in fengshui forest communities. The communities in the middle and later stage of succession had a complex vertical structure and most of the arbor layer could be divided into sub-layers. The communities in the initial stage of succession had a relatively simple structure. The Patrick Index varied from 22 to 100, whilst the Shannon-Wiener Index varied from 0.3861 to 3.0901. Values of between 0.1380 and 0.9261 were observed for the Simpson Index, while the Pielou Index (Jsw) was between 0.1289 and 0.9427. A difference could be identified between the Sorenson Index and the Bray-Curtis Index. The Shannon- Wiener Index and the Patrick Index exhibited similar patterns, but the Simpson Index and the Pielou Index had different patterns. The index of β diversity showed that there was a high coefficient of community similarity among the fengshui forest communities. As the succession progressed, the β diversity of other communities would increase gradually. Plant communities in the ecological safety islands of urban Guangzhou are in positive succession with an increase in species diversity. As the distance between sample-plot and city center increases, the number of species, the proportion of native species, and the coefficient of community similarity also increase. In comparison with the typical southern subtropical zonal vegetation in Dinghushan, vegetation of the ecological safety islands in urban Guangzhou have similar floristic characteristics. In general, species diversity in the ecological safety islands of Guangzhou may not be as rich as that in Dinghushan. However, some communities in Guangzhou, with a longer succession history, have nearly reached the climax stage, with a rich diversity, and may be equivalent to the same stage in Dinghushan. Species diversity is affected by different habitat conditions, such as the spatial distance among vegetation patches, the distance between habitats and the city center, and human disturbance. In highly urbanized areas, by strengthening conservation, vegetation communities that have a similar structure and species diversity to the zonal climax community may develop.",,Island (Population);,,negative,nan,0,1360,1,GAY9UFPD,journalArticle,2003,"Barré, N.; Bachy, P.",Complement to the list of the birds of New Caledonia,Alauda,,00024619 (ISSN),,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0038672025&partnerID=40&md5=08686e36ebe228a5d4ae2f144e92ed87,"Over the last five years, ten species of birds not previously known on the island have been seen, increasing the number of species/subspecies recorded in New Caledonia to about 192 taxa.

For example, forestry practices and anthropogenic disturbances are both cited as factors fragmenting the once extensive range of Gopherus polyphemus. One localized, but extreme, source of fragmentation was the impoundment of the Chattahoochee River in 1963 to form Walter F. George Reservoir along the border of Georgia and Alabama. The formation of this reservoir isolated populations of G. polyphemus on two newly created islands providing a natural laboratory to explore the demographics and genetic effects of fragmentation on a long-lived species. These populations were first surveyed in 1984 and, 21 years later, we revisited them to collect demographic data and tissue samples for genetic analysis. We genotyped all individuals for 10 microsatellite loci, and we tested these data for bottlenecks and compared them to levels of genetic diversity for populations from other portions of the range. We found 45 and two individuals on the larger and smaller islands, respectively. On the large island, however, the population size was identical to the 1984 survey. Only the population structure based on estimated age differed between the 1984 and 2004 surveys, while population size structure based on carapace length, sex ratio, and sex-specific growth rates did not differ. The population of the large island showed genetic evidence of a past bottleneck. The genetic diversity indices from the population of the large island, however, were comparable to or greater than those found at mainland sites, in particular from western populations. © 2011.

The Thousand Island Lake in Southeast China is one such land-bridge system with more than 1000 islands. Based on a field survey of vascular plant richness on 154 land-bridge islands during 2007-2008, we examined the effects of island and landscape attributes on plant species richness and patterns of species nestedness. We also examined the different responses of plant functional groups (classified according to growth form and shade tolerance) to fragmentation. We found that island area explained the greatest amount of variation in plant species richness. Island area and shape index positively affected species diversity and the degree of nestedness exhibited by plant communities while the perimeter to area ratio of the islands had a negative effect.

The Thousand Island Lake in Southeast China is one such land-bridge system with more than 1000 islands. Based on a field survey of vascular plant richness on 154 land-bridge islands during 2007-2008, we examined the effects of island and landscape attributes on plant species richness and patterns of species nestedness. We also examined the different responses of plant functional groups (classified according to growth form and shade tolerance) to fragmentation. We found that island area explained the greatest amount of variation in plant species richness. Island area and shape index positively affected species diversity and the degree of nestedness exhibited by plant communities while the perimeter to area ratio of the islands had a negative effect. Shade-tolerant plants were the most sensitive species group to habitat fragmentation.

Rachel Atkinson and colleagues review eradication as a tool for invasive species management in Galápagos. They report on the history of species introductions in Galápagos and show that the rate of introductions steadily increased since the 1830s, rising most rapidly during the last 50 years. In 2008, the tally of introduced terrestrial species was 1, 445 including 870 plants, 536 invertebrates, 30 vertebrates and ten diseases. Of these introduced species, many have invaded native ecosystems. Vertebrate invasions were the first to cause impact and alarm in the latter half of the twentieth century. These have been followed by plant and invertebrate invasions that now cover huge areas, particularly in the highland regions of the inhabited islands, and further invasions are expected in future. The authors encourage the reader to consider potentially positive and negative impacts of eradication programs to the whole ecosystem, not just iconic species. They consider four main criteria before deciding to attempt eradication: (1) strategic-operational; (2) biological; (3) economic; and (4) socio-political. They list the following important considerations: (1) an eradication operation should not be attempted if reintroduction cannot be prevented; (2) the rate of removal must exceed the rate of population increase; (3) species with limited distributions, that are easily detectable, with a short-lived dormant stage (e.g. a seed or egg bank), and that have a known control method for reproductive individuals, are prime candidates for eradication; (4) eradications, especially when carried out at the early stages of invasion, are cost-effective and theoretically neat solutions to prevent the future or current impact of invasive species. Additionally, eradications should not be started if there is insufficient funding to address unforeseen consequences of the operation on ecosystem dynamics. Another frequently overlooked requirement is the need for governmental and public support for all aspects of the project from the start in order to ensure that there are no barriers to the program from beginning to end. The tool of eradication is attractive to both donors and managers alike, as there is a measurable outcome and a definite endpoint to the project. However, there are limits to the use of eradication as a tool for conservation. The authors discuss these limits, analyzing 57 eradication projects of vertebrates, invertebrates and vascular plants from 1961 to present. Of these, 27 have been successful, 20 unsuccessful and ten are ongoing. The majority of successes were of large vertebrates, whereas most plant and invertebrate eradication attempts were unsuccessful. They found common trends in project successes and failures with operational, biological, economic and social criteria all contributing. They discuss the future of eradications and the alternatives in Galápagos. Matthias Wolff and coworkers use a trophic modeling approach to integrate ecological and fisheries data for a holistic description of the Galápagos Marine Reserve (GMR) ecosystem and to evaluate the effect of the banning of industrial fishing in the GMR in 1998 and the coinciding El Niño event. For the construction of their baseline flow model they used data from the late 1990s when industrial fishery was still in place. Estimated pre-1998 catch volumes in the GMR were in the realms of average catches in other oceanic and shelf systems, hence, the model was considered to be realistic. Top order predators were the warmblooded toothed whales, but large pelagic fish and cephalopods also played a prominent role. Simulations suggest that the GMR has undergone a substantial recovery process of large pelagic fish and sharks since industrial fishery was banned 12 years ago. According to the model simulations, most large pelagic fish would have - under normal environmental conditions - attained 10-20% stock increase after only two years after the fishery ban, concordant with literature findings showing that marine reserve closure is almost immediately effective in less than two years. Nevertheless, the El Niño event suppressed this rapid response for a further two to three years, suggesting that the bottom-up effect on the system of reduced primary productivity was stronger than the top-down effect from the release in fishing pressure. The first species predicted to surpass the pre-El Niño reference level was the yellowfin tuna, followed by wahoo, dolphin fish and sailfish. Owing to their slow population turnover rates, sharks followed later. Juvenile sharks are predicted to maintain reduced biomass throughout the time due to strong control by increased levels of top predators. Sea lions, cormorants, penguins and sea turtles needed the whole 12-year period to rebuild their populations. The authors emphasize that the disruption of the system by the El Niño impacted in the medium term (three to nine years), leading to higher biomasses of large pelagic fish predators than under the same fishery conditions without the El Niño impact. This suggests that, since predator biomass is reduced during the El Niño, prey populations find an “open loophole” to proliferate first and are then followed by their predators in a Lotka-Volterra fashion. It then takes several years for the system to normalize. Long-term monitoring data for marine mammals, birds and sea turtles confirmed the El Niño driven population reductions simulated by the model. Marjan van den Belt presents mediated modeling (MM) as a computer-based tool that can facilitate the participation of diverse stakeholders in the identification and valuation of ecosystem services from a conservation and human perspective. Systems thinking (the use of causal diagrams) and system dynamics (quantitative representations of feedback loops and time lags to understand systems) provide the underlying modeling philosophy.

The discussion between the stakeholders involved is interpreted by a mediated modeler and reflected back into the dialogue for all participants in real time. The integration of ecology, economics and social issues for sustainable development is often considered a normative objective in a MM process.

We investigated the underlying processes affecting their population dynamics by collection and analysis of demographic data from Pacific common eiders at 3 sites on the YKD (1991-2004) for 29 site-years. We examined variation in components of reproduction, tested hypotheses about the influence of specific ecological factors on life-history variables, and investigated their relative contributions to local population dynamics. Reproductive output was low and variable, both within and among individuals, whereas apparent survival of adult females was high and relatively invariant (0.89 ± 0.005). All reproductive parameters varied across study sites and years. Clutch initiation dates ranged from 4 May to 28 June, with peak (modal) initiation occurring on 26 May. Females at an island study site consistently initiated clutches 3-5 days earlier in each year than those on 2 mainland sites. Population variance in nest initiation date was negatively related to the peak, suggesting increased synchrony in years of delayed initiation. On average, total clutch size (laid) ranged from 4.8 to 6.6 eggs, and declined with date of nest initiation. After accounting for partial predation and non-viability of eggs, average clutch size at hatch ranged from 2.0 to 5.8 eggs. Within seasons, daily survival probability (DSP) of nests was lowest during egg-laying and late-initiation dates. Estimated nest survival varied considerably across sites and years (mean = 0.55, range: 0.06-0.92), but process variance in nest survival was relatively low (0.02, CI: 0.01-0.05), indicating that most variance was likely attributed to sampling error. We found evidence that observer effects may have reduced overall nest survival by 0.0-0.36 across site-years. Study sites with lower sample sizes and more frequent visitations appeared to experience greater observer effects. In general, Pacific common eiders exhibited high spatio-temporal variance in reproductive components. Larger clutch sizes and high nest survival at early initiation dates suggested directional selection favoring early nesting. However, stochastic environmental effects may have precluded response to this apparent selection pressure. Our results suggest that females breeding early in the season have the greatest reproductive value, as these birds lay the largest clutches and have the highest probability of successfully hatching. We developed stochastic, stage-based, matrix population models that incorporated observed spatio-temporal (process) variance and co-variation in vital rates, and projected the stable stage distribution (w) and population growth rate (λ). We used perturbation analyses to examine the relative influence of changes in vital rates on λ and variance decomposition to assess the proportion of variation in λ explained by process variation in each vital rate. In addition to matrix-based λ, we estimated λ using capture-recapture approaches, and log-linear regression. We found the stable age distribution for Pacific common eiders was weighted heavily towards experienced adult females (≤4 yr of age), and all calculations of λ indicated that the YKD population was stable to slightly increasing (λ matrix = 1.02, CI: 1.00-1.04); λ reverse-capture-recapture = 1.05, CI: 0.99-1.11; λ log-linear = 1.04, CI: 0.98-1.10). Perturbation analyses suggested the population would respond most dramatically to changes in adult female survival (relative influence of adult survival was 1.5 times that of fecundity), whereas retrospective variation in λ was primarily explained by fecundity parameters (60%), particularly duckling survival (42%). Among components of fecundity, sensitivities were highest for duckling survival, suggesting this vital rate may be a current restriction to further population growth. Increasing adult survival would have the largest positive effects on population growth, but practical ways to influence this vital rate are currently limited. Given that eider laying dates and nest fates may be closely tied to those of sympatrically nesting species, we hypothesize that management actions facilitating early nesting and targeting other species (e.g., increasing overall potential for predator-swamping) may have positive, concurrent effects on nesting common eiders. If enhancing population growth is the objective and assuming the population is not currently at carrying capacity, we recommend an adaptive management approach. This approach would begin with focused efforts towards increasing reproductive output, with particular emphasis on strategies to increase both fecundity and nest survival, such as predator control on breeding grounds, followed by evaluation of population response. However, we conducted our modeling efforts under assumptions of density independence, whereas density-dependent mechanisms may have played an important role in the historic decline and subsequent stabilization of our population at a new, lower equilibrium. In an adaptive-management context, our results can be used to test additional (density-related) models; our predicted response would be compared with actual population response to prescribed management manipulations. Failure of the population to positively respond to increases in vital rates and negative correlations among vital rates would serve as evidence of density-dependent regulation. Rejection of the density-independent model would support management actions focused on habitat improvement. © 2012 The Wildlife Society.",,Island (Population);,,negative,10.1002/wmon.8,11464,4338,11465,EXMDZLLA,journalArticle,2012,"Wilson, H.M.; Flint, P.L.; Powell, A.N.; Grand, J.B.; Moran, C.L.","Population ecology of breeding Pacific common eiders on the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta, Alaska",Wildlife Monographs,,00840173 (ISSN),10.1002/wmon.8,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84867866285&doi=10.1002%2fwmon.8&partnerID=40&md5=c25ff78e59ab2354122dee6709dbc3c6,"Populations of Pacific common eiders (Somateria mollissima v-nigrum) on the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta (YKD) in western Alaska declined by 50-90% from 1957 to 1992 and then stabilized at reduced numbers from the early 1990s to the present.

Among components of fecundity, sensitivities were highest for duckling survival, suggesting this vital rate may be a current restriction to further population growth. Increasing adult survival would have the largest positive effects on population growth, but practical ways to influence this vital rate are currently limited. Given that eider laying dates and nest fates may be closely tied to those of sympatrically nesting species, we hypothesize that management actions facilitating early nesting and targeting other species (e.g., increasing overall potential for predator-swamping) may have positive, concurrent effects on nesting common eiders. If enhancing population growth is the objective and assuming the population is not currently at carrying capacity, we recommend an adaptive management approach. This approach would begin with focused efforts towards increasing reproductive output, with particular emphasis on strategies to increase both fecundity and nest survival, such as predator control on breeding grounds, followed by evaluation of population response. However, we conducted our modeling efforts under assumptions of density independence, whereas density-dependent mechanisms may have played an important role in the historic decline and subsequent stabilization of our population at a new, lower equilibrium. In an adaptive-management context, our results can be used to test additional (density-related) models; our predicted response would be compared with actual population response to prescribed management manipulations. Failure of the population to positively respond to increases in vital rates and negative correlations among vital rates would serve as evidence of density-dependent regulation. Rejection of the density-independent model would support management actions focused on habitat improvement. © 2012 The Wildlife Society.",2012,2025-04-16 10:15:34,2025-04-16 10:15:34,,1-28,,182,,,Wildl.

We selected long-established, abundant invasive species with wide-ranging distributions in the eastern United States that likely make substantial contributions to the litter pool of invaded areas. Overall, leaf litter from invasive species differed from native litter, though differences varied by phylogenetic grouping. Invasive litter had lower carbon:nitrogen ratios (30.9 ± 1.96 SE vs. 32.8 ± 1.36, P = 0.034) and invasive species lost 0.03 ± 0.007 g of nitrogen and had 23.4 ± 4.9 % of their starting mass remaining at the end of 1 year compared with a loss of 0.02 ± 0.003 g nitrogen and 31.1 ± 2.6 % mass remaining for native species.

Researches in this habitat have received surprisingly little attention on the Amazon Coast, despite rock fragments provide refuges, nursery grounds and food sources for a variety of benthic species. The present survey describes the mobile macroinvertebrate species composition and richness of the intertidal rocky fragments in Areuá Island within the ""Mãe Grande de Curuçá"" Marine Extractive Reserve (RESEX) on the Brazilian Amazon Coast. Samples were collected during the dry (August and November 2009) and rainy seasons (March and May 2010) on the upper and lower intertidal zone, using a 625cm2 quadrat. At each season and intertidal zone, macroinvertebrate samples were collected along four transects (20m each) parallel to the waterline, and within each transect two quadrats were randomly sampled. Macroinvertebrates were identified, density determined, and biomass values obtained to characterize benthic diversity from the rocky fragments. The Jackknife procedure was used to estimate species richness from different intertidal zones during the dry and rainy seasons. Macrofaunal community comprised 85 taxa, with 17 ""unique"" taxa, 40 taxa were common to both intertidal zones and seasons, and 23 taxa have been recorded for the first time on the Brazilian Amazon Coast.

Polychaeta was the most dominant in species number, followed by Malacostraca and Gastropoda. Regarding frequency of occurrence, Crustacean species Dynamenella tropica, Parhyale sp. and Petrolisthes armatus were the most frequent representing >75% of frequency of occurrence and 39 taxa were least frequent representing <5% of frequency of occurrence. Occurrence of crustaceans and polychaetes were particularly noteworthy in all intertidal zones and seasons, represented by 15 and 13 taxa, respectively. The most representative class in abundance and biomass was Malacostraca that represented more than half of all individuals sampled, and was dominated by Petrolisthes armatus.

Regarding frequency of occurrence, Crustacean species Dynamenella tropica, Parhyale sp. and Petrolisthes armatus were the most frequent representing >75% of frequency of occurrence and 39 taxa were least frequent representing <5% of frequency of occurrence. Occurrence of crustaceans and polychaetes were particularly noteworthy in all intertidal zones and seasons, represented by 15 and 13 taxa, respectively. The most representative class in abundance and biomass was Malacostraca that represented more than half of all individuals sampled, and was dominated by Petrolisthes armatus. The latter was one of the most frequent, numerous and higher biomass species in the samples. In general, results indicated greater richness and biomass in the lower zone. Additionally, richness and density increase during the rainy season. Rock fragment fields in Areuá Island are rich in microhabitats and include a diverse array of species in a limited area. Our results underline the importance of rock fragment fields in Areuá Island for the maintenance of biodiversity in the Amazon Coast.",2014,2025-04-16 10:17:01,2025-04-16 10:17:01,,69-86,,1,62,,Rev.

It is possible to define the species distribution patterns much more accurately on the molecular level so that we could effectively promote the formation and development of molecular phylogeography. In recent years, molecular phylogeographic studies were carried out to promote the understanding the distribution patterns and formation mechanisms of rodent species. In this study, five areas for phylogeography in rodents were reviewed. 1) The phylogenetic relationships between rodent species and species taxa: The studies of molecular phylogeography determining the taxonomic status of rodents were developed from the species level to the phylogenetic level, and had a good foundation for the accurate evaluation of distribution patterns about rodent species. Traditional morphological classification in some species can not fully reflect the real differentiation of phylogenetic geography, especially for widely distributed species or subspecies. The intraspecific phylogenetic studies were very helpful to understand the phylogenetic relation of subspecies or populations. Ecological environment may lead to the convergent evolution of species. The traditional morphological taxonomy standards may result in to the taxonomic status errors of species. The studies about taxonomic status of species on the molecular phylogenetic level can lay the better foundation to understanding the taxonomic status of species and their distribution pattern causes. Molecular phylogenetic analysis on species taxa can show the evolutionary history of a more accurate estimation on closely related taxa unit, which can reflect the geographic distribution of taxa pattern. 2) The center of origin and evolution of the course: Molecular phylogeography methods can provide rich evidences for determining centers of origin about the higher taxa unit of rodents. In the species distribution range, the studies of the different regions could help to understand the center of origin about a species in rodents and its various lineages or subspecies evolutionary process after origin. Origin and evolution of the island rodents have their particularity, which included two aspects. The first aspect that the origin and evolution of the island rodent were closely linked with human activities, and on the other hand, the land bridge theory provide long-distance dispersal of animals theoretical basis. 3) The factors that influenced the geographical pattern of the systems: Because of different degrees and times of many ice ages during the Quaternary ice age, which influence on the geographical differences, distribution and post-glacial refuge diffusion path varies, as well as various rodent species to adapt to different forces that resulting in a variety of rodent animal patterns of biological systems.

Many dramatic events occurred in the late Tertiary and Quaternary geology had significantly direct impact on the distribution patterns of extant rodent. 4) The application of rodent prevention: Molecular biogeography studies promote to investigate the formation of species and distribution evolution pattern, which provide a reliable basis for controlling the harmful rodents. The data and methods of some molecular phylogeography have a reference value for rodent prevention. 5) Conservation biology: The study of intraspecific molecular phylogeography on the spatial distribution of genetic diversity, which could evaluate the level of genetic diversity, the protection value of species and determining ESUs and MUs in some regions.

Is an altered disturbance regime, environmental stress, or both, driving these changes? In what ways can observations in this savanna inform management of other species-rich plant communities? Location: Longleaf pine savannas in southeast North Carolina, USA. Methods: In 2011-2013, we re-surveyed permanent plots established in the 1980s and 1990s in a longleaf pine (Pinus palustris) savanna in North Carolina to quantify changes in species richness at multiple spatial scales following 15 yr of reduced fire frequency plus periodic drought. For comparison, we re-sampled other longleaf pine savannas in the region that had not experienced reduced fire frequency, but had experienced similar drought. In addition, we identified which types of species were lost and gained, and summarized changes in species frequency by growth form, plant height, and habitat affinity. Results: We detected substantial declines in small-scale species richness and species frequency from the 1980s to 2011, representing a loss of 33% to 41% of the flora, depending on the spatial scale. Small herbaceous species had become particularly scarce. Additional re-sampling in the wetter years of 2012 and 2013 after consecutive years of fire revealed that species richness had increased slightly from 2011, but was still considerably lower than that in the 1980s. Other savannas did not exhibit such dramatic declines in species richness, suggesting reduced fire frequency in addition to drought contributed to species loss in Big Island Savanna over time. Conclusions: Our work suggests that nearly annual fire is necessary for the maintenance of high plant species richness in mesic longleaf pine savannas, and even a modest reduction in fire frequency can have dramatic negative impacts. This study also suggests that drought is an important factor structuring grassland ecosystems in the southeastern US, despite relatively high regional precipitation.

In one such group of islands in the southern GBR, the Keppel Island archipelago, climate-driven disturbances frequently result in major coral mortality. Whilst these island reefs have clearly survived such dramatic disturbances in the past, the consequences of extreme mortality events may include the loss of genetic diversity, and hence adaptive potential, and a reduction in fitness due to inbreeding, especially if new recruitment fromexternal sources is limited.Here we examined the level of isolation of the Keppel Island group as well as patterns of gene flow within the Keppel Islands using 10 microsatellite markers in nine populations of the coral, Acropora millepora. Bayesian cluster analysis and assignment tests indicated gene flow is restricted, but not absent, between the outer and inner Keppel Island groups, and that extensive gene flow exists within each of these island groups. Comparison of the Keppel Island data with results from a previous GBR-wide study that included a single Keppel Island population, confirmed that A. millepora in the Keppel Islands is genetically distinct from populations elsewhere on the GBR, with exception of the nearby inshore High Peak Reef just north of the Keppel Islands. We compared patterns of genetic diversity in the Keppel Island populations with those from other GBR populations and found themto be slightly, but significantly lower, consistent with the archipelago being geographically isolated, but there was no evidence for recent bottlenecks or deviation frommutation-drift equilibrium. A high incidence of private alleles in the Keppel Islands, particularly in the outer islands, supports their relative isolation and contributes to the conservation value of the archipelago. The lack of evidence for genetic erosion, in combination with our observation that the North Keppel Island population samples collected in 2002 and 2008, respectively, exhibited a pairwise genetic distance of zero, supports previous published work indicating that, following bleaching, Acropora corals in the Keppel Islands predominantly recover from regrowth of small amounts of remaining live tissue in apparently dead coral colonies.

Do (1) dominant and subordinate species respond in the same way to changes in environmental variables; (2) plant species assemblages show higher interspecific than intraspecific trait responses; and (3) co-existing dominant species differ in their responses to the same environmental variables? Location: Islands in Lakes Uddjaure and Hornavan, northern Sweden. Methods: We explored the responses of forest understorey vegetation assemblages to variation in environmental resources across a chronosequence of 30 lake islands that differ in fire history, above-ground and below-ground resource availability and species diversity. For one plot on each island, we measured specific leaf area, leaf dry matter content and foliar N and P of all dominant and subordinate understorey plant species to assess species-specific and weighted and non-weighted community-level trait responses to variation across islands in all major local environmental drivers. Results: Consistent with our expectations, we found that species responses to environmental conditions were not homogenous within assemblages, and that responses of dominant and subordinate species differed. Further, intraspecific variation was often an important component of local-scale plant community-level responses. Responses were often relatively consistent across species, but dominant species sometimes showed contrasting responses of the same trait to the same environmental factor. Finally, environmental factors that influenced community average trait values also affected functional diversity. Conclusions: This study has shown that several common assumptions that underpin community assembly theory do not necessarily hold, and this can cause inaccuracies in predicting plant functional composition responses to changes in environmental variables. Because these assumptions are central to current models that predict vegetation responses to environmental change, it is crucial to further test in which particular environmental context and to what extent these assumptions are critical for model accuracy. © 2014 International Association for Vegetation Science.",,Island (Population);,,negative,10.1111/jvs.12218,14628,5554,14629,W79H46T2,journalArticle,2015,"Kumordzi, B.B.; Wardle, D.A.; Freschet, G.T.",Plant assemblages do not respond homogenously to local variation in environmental conditions: Functional responses differ with species identity and abundance,Journal of Vegetation Science,,11009233 (ISSN),10.1111/jvs.12218,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84911995902&doi=10.1111%2fjvs.12218&partnerID=40&md5=df73af7c39d1cb4cfc3628526a0d07a0,"Questions: We investigated some commonly held assumptions of community assembly theory needed to provide accurate predictions of changes in plant species assemblages across environmental gradients or following environmental change.

Results: Consistent with our expectations, we found that species responses to environmental conditions were not homogenous within assemblages, and that responses of dominant and subordinate species differed. Further, intraspecific variation was often an important component of local-scale plant community-level responses. Responses were often relatively consistent across species, but dominant species sometimes showed contrasting responses of the same trait to the same environmental factor. Finally, environmental factors that influenced community average trait values also affected functional diversity. Conclusions: This study has shown that several common assumptions that underpin community assembly theory do not necessarily hold, and this can cause inaccuracies in predicting plant functional composition responses to changes in environmental variables. Because these assumptions are central to current models that predict vegetation responses to environmental change, it is crucial to further test in which particular environmental context and to what extent these assumptions are critical for model accuracy. © 2014 International Association for Vegetation Science.",2015,2025-04-16 10:17:50,2025-04-16 10:17:50,,32-45,,1,26,,J.

The most abundant elements generally have the largest numbers of mineral species, as modeled by relationships for Earth's upper continental crust (E) and the Moon (M), respectively: Log(NE) = 0:22 Log(CE) + 1:70 (R2 = 0:34)(4861 minerals; 72 elements) Log(NM) = 0:19 Log(CM) + 0:23 (R2 = 0:68)(63 minerals; 24 elements); where C is an element's abundance in ppm and N is the number of mineral species in which that element is essential. Several elements that plot significantly below the trend for Earth's upper continental crust (e.g., Ga, Hf, and Rb) mimic other more abundant elements and thus are less likely to form their own species. Other elements (e.g., Ag, As, Cu, Pb, S, and U) plot significantly above the trend, which we attribute to their unique crystal chemical affinities, multiple coordination and oxidation states, their extreme concentration in some ore-forming fluids, and/or frequent occurrence with a variety of other rare elements-all factors that increase the diversity of mineral species incorporating these elements. The corresponding diagram for the Moon shows a tighter fit, most likely because none of these elements, except Cu and S, are essential constituents in lunar minerals. Given the similar slopes for Earth and the Moon, we suggest that the increase in mineral diversity with element abundance is a deterministic aspect of planetary mineral diversity. Though based on a limited number of collecting sites, the Moon's observed mineralogical diversity could be close to the minimum for a rocky planet or moon comparable in size - A baseline against which diversity of other terrestrial planets and moons having radii in the same range as Earth and its Moon can be measured. Mineral-forming processes on the Moon are limited to igneous activity, meteor impacts, and the solar wind-processes that could affect any planet or moon. By contrast, other terrestrial planets and moons have been subjected to more varied physical, chemical, and (in the case of Earth) biological processes that can increase mineral diversity in both deterministic and stochastic ways. Total mineral diversity for different elements is not appreciably influenced by the relative stabilities of individual phases, e.g., the broad pressure-temperature-composition stability ranges of cinnabar (HgS) and zircon (ZrSiO4) do not significantly diminish the diversity of Hg or Zr minerals. Moreover, the significant expansion of near-surface redox conditions on Earth through the evolution of microbial oxygenic photosynthesis tripled the available composition space of Earth's near-surface environment, and resulted in a corresponding tripling of mineral diversity subsequent to atmospheric oxidation. Of 4933 approved mineral species, 34% are known from only one or two localities, and more than half are known from five or fewer localities. Statistical analysis of this frequency distribution suggests that thousands of other plausible rare mineral species await discovery or could have occurred at some point in Earth's history, only to be subsequently lost by burial, erosion, or subduction-i.e., much of Earth's mineral diversity associated with rare species results from stochastic processes. Measurements of stellar stoichiometry reveal that stars can differ significantly from the Sun in relative abundances of rock-forming elements, which implies that bulk compositions of some extrasolar Earth-like planets likely differ significantly from those of Earth, particularly if the fractionation processes in evolving stellar nebulas and planetary differentiation are factored in. Comparison of Earth's upper continental crust and the Moon shows that differences in element ratios are reflected in ratios of mineral species containing these elements. In summary, although deterministic factors control the distribution of the most common rock-forming minerals in Earth's upper continental crust and on the Moon, stochastic processes play a significant role in the diversity of less common minerals.

Forest vertebrate populations thus become stranded in habitat islands, with their persistence governed by a combination of species life-history traits, habitat patch, and landscape context. We investigate the patterns of species extinction of 34 arboreal and terrestrial vertebrate species within three continuous forest sites and 37 land-bridge islands within one of the largest South American hydroelectric reservoirs, based on a combination of camera trapping, line-transect censuses, sign surveys, and armadillo burrow counts. Forest area was the best predictor of species persistence, so we classified all species into three levels of vulnerability to habitat insularization, with most species defined as 'area-sensitive'. However, island occupancy was decisively determined by individual species traits, with wide-ranging species and poor dispersers showing high local extinction rates. We detected higher island occupancy rates of large vertebrate species compared to other Neotropical fragmented forest landscapes, suggesting that this is critically attributed to the absence of hunting pressure at Balbina.

Quantifying patterns of tree species richness in the field is time consuming, especially in regions with over 100 tree species/ha. We examine species richness in a 50-ha plot in Barro Colorado Island in Panama and test if biophysical measurements of canopy reflectance from high-resolution satellite imagery and detailed vertical forest structure and topography from light detection and ranging (lidar) are associated with species richness across four tree size classes (>1, 1-10, (>10, and (>20 cm dbh) and three spatial scales (1, 0.25, and 0.04 ha). We use the 2010 tree inventory, including 204 757 individuals belonging to 301 species of freestanding woody plants or 166±1.5 species/ha (mean ± SE), to compare with remote-sensing data. All remote-sensing metrics became less correlated with species richness as spatial resolution decreased from 1.0 ha to 0.04 ha and tree size increased from 1 cm to 20 cm dbh. When all stems with dbh > 1 cm in 1-ha plots were compared to remote-sensing metrics, standard deviation in canopy reflectance explained 13% of the variance in species richness. The standard deviations of canopy height and the topographic wetness index (TWI) derived from lidar were the best metrics to explain the spatial variance in species richness (15% and 24%, respectively). Using multiple regression models, we made predictions of species richness across Barro Colorado Island (BCI) at the 1-ha spatial scale for different tree size classes.

Quantifying patterns of tree species richness in the field is time consuming, especially in regions with over 100 tree species/ha. We examine species richness in a 50-ha plot in Barro Colorado Island in Panama and test if biophysical measurements of canopy reflectance from high-resolution satellite imagery and detailed vertical forest structure and topography from light detection and ranging (lidar) are associated with species richness across four tree size classes (>1, 1-10, (>10, and (>20 cm dbh) and three spatial scales (1, 0.25, and 0.04 ha). We use the 2010 tree inventory, including 204 757 individuals belonging to 301 species of freestanding woody plants or 166±1.5 species/ha (mean ± SE), to compare with remote-sensing data. All remote-sensing metrics became less correlated with species richness as spatial resolution decreased from 1.0 ha to 0.04 ha and tree size increased from 1 cm to 20 cm dbh. When all stems with dbh > 1 cm in 1-ha plots were compared to remote-sensing metrics, standard deviation in canopy reflectance explained 13% of the variance in species richness. The standard deviations of canopy height and the topographic wetness index (TWI) derived from lidar were the best metrics to explain the spatial variance in species richness (15% and 24%, respectively). Using multiple regression models, we made predictions of species richness across Barro Colorado Island (BCI) at the 1-ha spatial scale for different tree size classes. We predicted variation in tree species richness among all plants (adjusted r2=0.35) and trees with dbh > 10 cm (adjusted r2=0.25).

6364,Prehistoric economy of the islands of Britanny (France): Inputs from the Late and Final Neolithic lithic industries,"Audouard, L.",2016,Bulletin de la Societe Prehistorique Francaise,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84995900580&partnerID=40&md5=a3ac7d2979e0c5717afc5af164361a10,,"The economy of an island territory, and particularly its supply dynamic, is an area that has been little explored in terms of the installation of the first agro-pastoral societies on the English Channel/Atlantic seaboard. Many inventories and field campaigns have been carried out over the past five years on islands off the Brittany coast (Daire, 2009; Daire and Hamon, 2013; Pailler and Gandois, 2011; Le Bihan et al., 2010; Large, 2014, etc.). The quality and the quantity of the data are variable according to the islands concerned (recent or old inventories, presence/absence of surveys or excavations), highlighting our ignorance of the archaeology of certain islands (such as Belle-Ile-en-Mer). Nevertheless, these archaeological studies have led to a preliminary synthesis of the dynamics of occupation of these island spaces, from the Neolithic period to the Bronze Age (Audouard, 2014). The most important part of an &#39;archaeology of islands&#39; is to consider that islanders are not necessarily isolated people. In the book The archaeology of Islands, P. Rainbird points out that so far, archaeological studies on islands have mostly been based on the idea that the island area as a geographical unit ensured the unit of analysis which emerged. The author emphasizes in his argument the fact that the islands are part of a community of &#39;people of the sea&#39; that cannot be limited to the island, and that must be understood in a wider geographical area that contains oceanic expanses and other nearby islands and continental coasts. The sea is not the border, but the continuity of the territory: &quot;We need to accept that people were at home with the sea [[]...]&quot; (Rainbird, 2007). In the particular framework of our studies on the islands of Brittany, this approach has made it possible to address questions about the degree of insularity of these territories, the existence or absence of particularities, as well as the links maintained between the islanders and their continental neighbours. The main problematics of our research can be explained as follows: Firstly, did the resources of these islands, both varied (terrestrial and marine) and limited (small cultivable land area, complex hunting management), result in an adaptation of lifestyles? Did the populations merely endure their environment or did they overcome the constraints through the dynamics of contacts and exchanges? The lithic industry is a relevant medium to address the terms of supply of raw materials, and examine the importance of imported rocks. In this article, the results presented cover the Late/Final Neolithic period, a phase in which the exploitation of coastal resources seems rationalized, and where trade with the continent attests to unequal situations between the islands of the Iroise Sea and the Atlantic islands: examination of the lithic industry from different sites of the Breton peninsula (from the Mol&#232;ne archipelago to the island of Belle-&#206;le-en-Mer) points to overexploitation of coastal flint pebbles, explaining their decrease in size from the beginning of the Neolithic. This overexploitation of local resources was coupled with a very low call on imports, exogenous rocks being only poorly represented in the assemblages. The presence of exogenous materials (such as the Turonian flint from Grand-Pressigny) on some islands reveals the existence of contacts between the mainland and island communities, the latter appearing open to outside influences. Nevertheless, these imports are always in limited proportions, around 1[%] of the lithic assemblage. The abundance of flint coastal pebbles seems to have covered the needs of the insular community. Some differences between the islands are highlighted. Indeed, the islanders of southern Brittany appear to have been more integrated within the exchange networks than the islanders of the Iroise Sea. If we look at the distribution of Grand-Pressigny flint, which was a major lithic material used in exchanges during the Late Neolithic (Ihuel, 2009), the imbalance between islands is striking. The geographical distance separating the islands of the Iroise Sea from the sedimentary basins bordering the Armorican Massif may possibly provide an initial explanation for this situation. In addition to the presentation of the supply of raw material, we will also discuss the importance of bipolar percussion on an anvil within the islands&#39; lithic industry. With the support of several lithic studies, including systematic measurements, we will discuss the relative roles of determinism and choice in the exploitation of coastal pebbles. Finally, we will discuss the importance of the overexploitation of local resources within the insular economy at the end of the Neolithic. First, in the south Morbihan area, the multiplication of knapping spots where bipolar percussion on an anvil was exclusively used attests to an almost &#39;industrial&#39; exploitation of the costal pebbles. This overexploitation of the local resource on islands can also be observed with the specific case of the sites with abundant borers. Six occupations, from the island of Molene to the island of Ol&#233;ron, are distinguished by an abundant presence of borers, linked to the manufacturing activity of shell ornaments on the island of Ol&#233;ron (Laporte, 2009). In fact, those specialized sites (knapping spots, sites with abundant borers) could have played a key role in the islanders&#39; economy at the end of the Neolithic. In that case, the overexploitation of local resources could be seen as testifying to dynamic communities, in strong interaction with the mainland (despite the lack of exogenous rocks). Furthermore, the localization of those specialized sites on &#39;small islands&#39; and &#39;islets&#39; could also demonstrate an economic and cultural organization of the landscape, between the biggest islands (such as Ouessant, Belle-&#206;le-en-Mer) and the smaller ones, dedicated to specific activities. The role of islands in the economic operation of the first agro-pastoral societies on the French Atlantic coast is a vast area of research where many developments are appearing.",Terrestrial biodiversity (Population);,,Monitoring (Outcome);,negative,nan,0,1360,1,GAY9UFPD,journalArticle,2003,"Barré, N.; Bachy, P.",Complement to the list of the birds of New Caledonia,Alauda,,00024619 (ISSN),,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0038672025&partnerID=40&md5=08686e36ebe228a5d4ae2f144e92ed87,"Over the last five years, ten species of birds not previously known on the island have been seen, increasing the number of species/subspecies recorded in New Caledonia to about 192 taxa.

Species may reach oceanic islands by three mechanisms: (1) mating flights of reproductives, (2) rafting, and (3) human-assisted dispersal. Past land bridge connections may be important for continental shelf islands. Patterns of species accumulation may be similar even when primary mechanisms of dispersal differ. Colonizing propagules are limited primarily by the presence of suitable habitat and interspecific competition or predation from other ants. Although island area is usually a significant predictor of species richness, the diversity of habitat types is often a better predictor. Distance, or isolation, has often been found to be only a weak predictor of ant species richness, probably because many islands that have been studied are not very distant relative to most species' dispersal abilities. Interspecific competition appears to result in mutually exclusive distributions within islands for some of the more aggressive species, although the effects of habitat affinities have not been well studied. With the exception of very small islands, competition does not appear to result in exclusions of species from entire islands, and robust patterns of nestedness have been observed. Populations go extinct from and immigrate to small islands in ecological time, although such turnover appears to be relatively low compared with other arthropods. Only a few archipelagoes, however, have been the focus of turnover studies. Some species may reach extremely high population abundances on islands but subsequently decline. The exact mechanisms underlying these population fluctuations are not known with certainty, although the presence of honeydew-producing insects has often been associated with the most dramatic cases. Endemicity varies greatly and ranges from 0 to > 96%, peaking at intermediate distances in the Pacific and reaching the highest levels on islands in the Indian Ocean. Anthropogenic disturbances appear to present the greatest driver of change to insular ant communities and result in increasing numbers and abundances of exotic ant species, which may have deleterious effects on the rest of the community.",,,Monitoring (Outcome);,negative,nan,0,1360,1,GAY9UFPD,journalArticle,2003,"Barré, N.; Bachy, P.",Complement to the list of the birds of New Caledonia,Alauda,,00024619 (ISSN),,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0038672025&partnerID=40&md5=08686e36ebe228a5d4ae2f144e92ed87,"Over the last five years, ten species of birds not previously known on the island have been seen, increasing the number of species/subspecies recorded in New Caledonia to about 192 taxa.

Indices and metrics of ownership property sizes and landscape structure were calculated for 20 km buffer areas around 31 North American Breeding Bird Survey transects, 12 located within the Edwards Plateau ecoregion and 18 in contiguous ecoregions. The number of bird species observed at each transect provided a measure of avian species richness associated with land cover classes for each respective transect (González in Urban influence on diversity of avifauna in the Edwards Plateau of Texas: effect of property sizes on rural landscape structure, Texas A&M University, 2005). Spatial correlations were calculated between each pair of the landscape indices. Spatial analysis identified a “threshold of habitat fragmentation” for the 500 acre (ac) ownership property size. Significant spatial correlations among variables showed that property sizes lower than 500 ac produced habitat fragmentation represented by a decrease in mean patch size (MN) and proximity among habitat patches (Index PROX). Spatial analysis also made possible the prioritization of ecological sub-regions of the Edwards Plateau for conservation or restoration. The Live Oak-Mesquite Savannah showed the highest average ownership property size (7305 ac) and the highest values of patch richness. Based on the results, management in the Live Oak-Mesquite Savannah sub-region should focus on the conservation of land mosaic diversity to assure native avian species turnover (Whittaker 1972).

The proliferation of non-native species can result in the loss of native species through direct and indirect interactions with predators, competitors, pathogens and parasites. Thus identifying invasion hotspots and understanding the capacity of vulnerable ecosystems to absorb new invasions is fundamental to conserving native biodiversity and preventing further introductions. Here, we assess whether endemic biodiversity, land-use and human population density predict the location of invasion hotspots and ecological saturation in streams across the Hawaiian archipelago. We found that non-native fishes, mollusks, crustaceans, and insects are prevalent in Hawaiian streams across the archipelago, whereas the distributions of native species appear to be constrained by urbanization and habitat alteration. We detected a strong link between invasion hotspots and human population densities, and we found a positive relationship between the number of non-native species and native species present in watersheds, suggesting that Hawaiian streams are not ecologically saturated. Though native species richness explained more than half of the variance in non-native mollusks and crustaceans, it explained a low proportion of the variance in non-native fish and insect richness, indicating that a compilation of factors influence total non-native species richness in Hawaiian streams. Our findings reveal that Hawaiian streams remain vulnerable to further species introductions, and that conservation of endemic Hawaiian stream fauna can be improved by addressing interactions between introductions and degradation that can arise from human habitation.",Terrestrial biodiversity (Population);,,,negative,nan,0,1360,1,GAY9UFPD,journalArticle,2003,"Barré, N.; Bachy, P.",Complement to the list of the birds of New Caledonia,Alauda,,00024619 (ISSN),,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0038672025&partnerID=40&md5=08686e36ebe228a5d4ae2f144e92ed87,"Over the last five years, ten species of birds not previously known on the island have been seen, increasing the number of species/subspecies recorded in New Caledonia to about 192 taxa.

Reductions in roadside mowing is a passive restoration approach that can create habitat, lower management costs, and reduce fragmentation, but managers fear reducing mowing will allow invasive plants to proliferate.

We compared plant diversity and percent cover at roadside sites under three types of vegetation management in Rhode Island-Reference (no-mow forested roadsides, n = 5), Restored (reduced mowing plan, n = 5), Mowed (traditional mowing plan, n = 5)-at four spatial scales using Modified-Whittaker vegetation surveys. Reference sites had the highest native species richness at two spatial scales, the lowest introduced species richness at three spatial scales, and the lowest introduced species percent cover. Invasive species diversity and abundance was not affected by mowing treatment. Because we did not observe an increase of invasive or introduced plant species at sites which are transitioning from Mowed to Restored, we recommend roadside managers implement passive roadside restoration wherever possible.

Alternatively, managers could restore roadsides to varying stages of succession to increase habitat heterogeneity.

In these reservoirs, vertebrate studies have focused on local (α) diversity measures, whereas between-site (β) diversity remains poorly assessed despite its pivotal importance in understanding how species diversity is structured and maintained. Here, we unravel the patterns and ecological correlates of mammal β-diversity, including both small (SM) and midsized to large mammal species (LM) across 23 islands and two continuous forest sites within a mega hydroelectric reservoir. Location: Balbina Hydroelectric Dam, Central Brazilian Amazonia. Methods: Small mammals were sampled using live and pitfall traps (48,350 trap-nights), and larger mammals using camera traps (8,160 trap-nights). β-diversity was examined for each group using multiplicative diversity decomposition of Hill numbers, which considers the importance of rare, common and dominant species, and tested to what extent those were related to a set of environmental characteristics measured at different spatial scales. Results: β-diversity for both mammal groups was higher when considering species presence–absence. When considering species abundance, β-diversity was significantly higher for SM than for LM assemblages. Habitat variables, such as differences in tree species richness and percentage of old-growth trees, were strong correlates of β-diversity for both SMs and LMs. Conversely, β-diversity was weakly related to patch and landscape characteristics, except for LMs, for which β-diversity was correlated with differences in island sizes.

These acoustic dialects and their corresponding social groups are often related to distinct foraging behaviors or spatial movement patterns, and it is possible that vocal repertoire variability is one of the proximate mechanisms driving or maintaining genetic and ecological diversity at a subspecies level in social species. Short-finned pilot whales (Globicephala macrorynchus) inhabiting Hawaiian waters have a stable hierarchical social structure, with familial social units associating in larger social clusters within island-associated communities. In this study, we test the hypothesis that sympatric social groups of short-finned pilot whales have acoustically differentiated dialects, which may be used to maintain the social structure. We first examined call composition of social calls collected from photographically identified social clusters of short-finned pilot whales around the Main Hawaiian Islands, using a catalog of manually classified calls, and found that call composition differed among clusters. We then conducted ANOVA and support vector machine (SVM) learning analyses of the acoustic features of social calls. Social clusters were significantly differentiated in their acoustic features, and the SVM classification accuracy was 60%. These results indicate that vocal repertoire reflects social segregation in short-finned pilot whales and may be a driving mechanism of differentiation, potentially contributing to genetic diversity within populations. This suggests divergent acoustic population structure; however, the small sample size in this study decreases the ability to detect acoustic differences among groups. Additional sampling will improve our power to detect acoustic differences among social clusters of Hawaiian pilot whales and improve classification accuracy. The pattern described here highlights the importance of increasing the spatial and temporal resolution of conservation and management plans for this species, in order to conserve subpopulation genetic and social structure. Significance statement: In some species, vocal repertoires differ among social groups or populations of a species that use the same habitat. These differences, called dialects, are thought to be important to maintaining segregation among groups of animals with overlapping distributions, and in some cases may increase intra-specific ecological or genetic variability. This study is the first to provide evidence that sympatric social clusters of short-finned pilot whales have different vocal repertoires, and that vocal repertoire within groups may change with behavioral context. In terrestrial (e.g., elephants) and marine (e.g., killer whales, sperm whales) species with similarly stable social hierarchies, where acoustic dialects, genetic diversity, and/or ecological variability are linked with social structure, anthropogenic stressors have precipitated rapid declines in abundance with slow or nonexistent recovery. Given the myriad threats faced by short-finned pilot whales in the Hawaiian Islands, including fisheries bycatch, military and commercial anthropogenic noise, and vessel strikes, understanding intra-population social structure and its links with genetic structure and ecological variability is imperative to the proper conservation and management of this species. © 2018, This is a U.S. Government work and not under copyright protection in the US; foreign copyright protection may apply.",Terrestrial biodiversity (Population);,,,negative,10.1007/s00265-018-2596-1,11868,7846,11869,RKJAQJ3S,journalArticle,2018,"Van Cise, A.M.; Mahaffy, S.D.; Baird, R.W.; Mooney, T.A.; Barlow, J.",Song of my people: dialect differences among sympatric social groups of short-finned pilot whales in Hawai’i,Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology,,03405443 (ISSN),10.1007/s00265-018-2596-1,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85058940267&doi=10.1007%2fs00265-018-2596-1&partnerID=40&md5=68bdc631c94fb7660a46da9fd85302fc,"Abstract: In many social species, acoustic dialects are used to differentiate among social groups within a local population.

However, the ecological and biological variables determining the structure of their communities within natural habitats are less documented in general and especially in the Comoe National Park, a Sudano-Guinean savanna zone located in the north-eastern part of Côte d’Ivoire (West Africa). Using a standardized method of belt transects, the structure of termite’s communities was estimated within habitats differing in the structure of their vegetation, soil characteristics, and the disturbance level caused by annual occurrences of bushfires. The effect of a set of environmental variables (habitat type, occurrence of annual bushfire, woody plant density, woody plant species richness, and soil physicochemical parameters) was tested on the habitat-specific recorded termite species. Sixty species of termites belonging to 19 genera, seven subfamilies and two families, namely Rhinotermitidae (Coptotermitinae and Rhinotermitinae) and Termitidae (Apicotermitinae, Cubitermitinae, Macrotermitinae, Nasutitermitinae, and Termitinae) were sampled. These species were assigned to the four feeding groups of termites: fungus growers (18 species), wood feeders (17 species), soil feeders (19 species) and the grass feeders (6 species). The highest diversity of termites was encountered in forest habitats, with 37 and 34, respectively, for the gallery forest and the forest island. Among savanna habitats, the woodland savanna was identified as the most diversified habitat with 32 recorded species, followed by the tree savanna (28 species) and the grassy savanna (17 species). The distribution of termite species and their respective feedings groups was determined by the habitat type and a set of environmental variables such as Woody Plant Diversity (WPD), Woody plant Families Diversity (WPFD), and Organic Carbon (OC). The annual Fire Occurrence (FO) was found to indirectly impact the characteristics of termite assemblages within natural habitats via their respective Herbaceous Species Richness (HSR) and Woody Plant Species Richness (WPSR).

While invasions by non-indigenous species are common and recognized as a significant conservation threat in terrestrial habitats of the Archipelago, little is known about the magnitude of invasions in its coastal marine waters. Based upon recent field surveys, available literature, and analysis of the biogeographic status of previously reported taxa, we report 53 non-indigenous species of marine invertebrates in the Galápagos Islands. Forty-eight (90.6%) of these species are newly reported or newly recognized as introduced, a nearly ten-fold increase from the five species previously recognized as non-indigenous. Of these 48 species, 30 (62.5%) were newly discovered in surveys commenced in 2015. Ascidians (11 species), bryozoans (10), polychaetes (9), and hydroids (8) account for 38 (71.7%) of the introduced species. Our analyses further detected 33 cryptogenic invertebrate and algal species and one littoral vascular plant. Most taxonomic groups remain to be assessed for the presence of non-indigenous species. Importantly, the recent field surveys were restricted predominantly to one habitat (harbor biofouling) on two islands, further suggesting that introduced species richness for the Galápagos Islands may be considerably higher. Most of the introduced species treated here were likely brought to the Galápagos by ships. While we presume that most if not all of the many thousands of vessels arriving in the Galápagos Islands since the 1500s had marine animals and plants attached to their hulls, we hypothesize that the general absence in the Islands of extensive shoreline structures (in the form of wharves, docks, pilings, and buoys) until the last half of the 20 th century may have constrained extensive colonization by fouling species. The proliferation of shoreline structures may have both provided expanded habitat for non-indigenous species that had earlier colonized natural substrates, as well as having facilitated a 20 th and 21 st century wave of new invasions in the Galápagos Islands. Our results represent the greatest reported increase in the recognition of the number of invasions for any tropical marine environment in the world. This work suggests that the number and potential ecological impacts of non-indigenous species in tropical marine and maritime habitats may be substantially underestimated in other regions of the world.

While invasions by non-indigenous species are common and recognized as a significant conservation threat in terrestrial habitats of the Archipelago, little is known about the magnitude of invasions in its coastal marine waters. Based upon recent field surveys, available literature, and analysis of the biogeographic status of previously reported taxa, we report 53 non-indigenous species of marine invertebrates in the Galápagos Islands. Forty-eight (90.6%) of these species are newly reported or newly recognized as introduced, a nearly ten-fold increase from the five species previously recognized as non-indigenous. Of these 48 species, 30 (62.5%) were newly discovered in surveys commenced in 2015. Ascidians (11 species), bryozoans (10), polychaetes (9), and hydroids (8) account for 38 (71.7%) of the introduced species. Our analyses further detected 33 cryptogenic invertebrate and algal species and one littoral vascular plant. Most taxonomic groups remain to be assessed for the presence of non-indigenous species. Importantly, the recent field surveys were restricted predominantly to one habitat (harbor biofouling) on two islands, further suggesting that introduced species richness for the Galápagos Islands may be considerably higher. Most of the introduced species treated here were likely brought to the Galápagos by ships. While we presume that most if not all of the many thousands of vessels arriving in the Galápagos Islands since the 1500s had marine animals and plants attached to their hulls, we hypothesize that the general absence in the Islands of extensive shoreline structures (in the form of wharves, docks, pilings, and buoys) until the last half of the 20                             th                              century may have constrained extensive colonization by fouling species.

Southern hemisphere populations of taxa that are morphologically similar to northern counterparts have traditionally been considered to be extensions of such Northern hemisphere taxa, and may not exhibit differentiation amongst geographically isolated populations in the Southern Ocean. Smooth-shelled blue mussels of the genus Mytilus that exhibit an anti-tropical distribution are a model group to study phylogeography, speciation and hybridisation in the sea, and contribute to the theory and practice of marine biosecurity. Methods: We used a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs) panel that has the ability to accurately identify reference Northern and Southern hemisphere Mytilus taxa to test for evolutionary differentiation amongst native Southern Ocean island populations. Results: Native mussels from the Falkland Islands and the Kerguelen Islands exhibited greatest affinity to native M. platensis d'Orbigny 1846 from the Atlantic coast of South America. The major Southern Ocean current flow from west to east is likely to explain the spreading of M. platensis to remote offshore islands, as adults via the process of rafting or perhaps directly as larvae. SNPs variation revealed that mussels from Tasmania were native and clearly differentiated from all other blue mussel groups in the Southern and Northern hemispheres. The native mussels M. planulatus from Tasmania and from mainland New Zealand (NZ), and tentatively M. aoteanus from the two NZ Southern Ocean offshore island groups (the Auckland Islands and Campbell Island), formed a distinct M. galloprovincialis-like Southern hemisphere group with closest affinity to Northern hemisphere M. galloprovincialis from the Mediterranean Sea. In all cases, the SNPs revealed evidence of hybridisation between two or more distinct taxa. The invasive Northern hemisphere M. galloprovincialis was identified only in Tasmania, amongst native mussels of a distinct Australian M. planulatus lineage. Conclusion: Overall, our results reveal that Southern hemisphere island mussels have mixed genome ancestry and are native, not introduced by human activities. The preservation of distinct evolutionary lineages of Southern hemisphere species needs to be an ongoing focus of conservation efforts, given that population sizes on some of the remote offshore oceanic islands will be small and may be more easily adversely affected by invasion and subsequent hybridisation and introgression than larger populations elsewhere. © 2019 The Author(s).",Terrestrial biodiversity (Population);,,,negative,10.1186/s12983-019-0332-y,11333,8507,11334,WAF9FK5A,journalArticle,2019,"Zbawicka, M.; Gardner, J.P.A.; Wenne, R.","Cryptic diversity in smooth-shelled mussels on Southern Ocean islands: Connectivity, hybridisation and a marine invasion",Frontiers in Zoology,,17429994 (ISSN),10.1186/s12983-019-0332-y,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85070460271&doi=10.1186%2fs12983-019-0332-y&partnerID=40&md5=295f3650d734ceb721119d3a28b37812,"Background: Large numbers of endemic species inhabit subantarctic continental coasts and islands that are characterised by highly variable environmental conditions.

We predicted the future of plant species and communities on the unique páramo sky islands by implementing the Spatial Explicit Species Assemblage Modelling framework. Specifically we: (a) calculated species’ maximum dispersal distance; (b) modelled species’ present and future distributions up to 2100; and (c) assembled models into plant communities. The final vulnerability assessment was based on a multi-dimensional evaluation that considered the species, local plant community and sky island levels. Location: Ecuadorian super-páramo (>4,200 m). Methods: Using species trait data, the maximum dispersal distance of 435 species was calculated. Species distribution models (SDM) were fitted to obtain current and future distribution predictions based on dispersal and bioclimatic factors. The final current assemblages and those for 2100 were achieved by stacking all probabilistic SDMs and applying the probability ranking rule. The vulnerability of each sky island was evaluated by quantifying richness and composition changes. Results: Maximum dispersal distances ranged between 0.008 m/year and 6,027 m/year, and across all scenarios, 70% of models showed a net loss in species distribution, while 9% of all species were predicted to undergo extinction in Ecuador by 2100. Local richness was estimated to decrease by 56.63% on average, and compositional changes in each sky island suggested a mean loss of 64.74% of their original species pool against a 12.97% gain.

Additionally, the environmental variables underpinning these patterns have not been extensively studied, nor have the relationships between squamate species richness and biome variety, a proxy for habitat heterogeneity. Here, we deconstruct the latitudinal diversity gradient of squamates and investigate lizard and snake species richness in relation to environmental gradients and biomes across continental North America. Location: North America, excluding islands. Taxon: Squamata (lizards and snakes). Methods: We collated a suite of environmental variables (n = 10) and squamate species ranges (n = 1,152) in an equal-area grid system (100 × 100 km cells) spanning continental North America. We deconstructed the latitudinal diversity gradient of squamates and examined species richness patterns for all lizards, all snakes and several individual squamate clades. We used multiple linear regressions to determine which environmental factors are most important for each squamate clade. Finally, we documented species richness within biomes and tested for correlations between species richness and biome variety. Results: Squamates exhibit a strong latitudinal diversity gradient across continental North America. Snakes are more widespread and have a stronger gradient than lizards. Our multiple linear regression results indicate strong associations between species richness and environmental variables for all individual squamate clades analysed; temperature variables are strongly positively correlated with species richness. Biome variety is more strongly correlated with lizard species richness than snake species richness. Squamates are most species-rich in tropical/subtropical forests, deserts and mangroves. Main conclusions: Most snake clades in North America exhibit strong latitudinal diversity gradients, but only two lizard clades, Dactyloidae (anoles) and Gekkota (geckos), display strong gradients and thus drive the overall lizard pattern.

Additionally, the environmental variables underpinning these patterns have not been extensively studied, nor have the relationships between squamate species richness and biome variety, a proxy for habitat heterogeneity. Here, we deconstruct the latitudinal diversity gradient of squamates and investigate lizard and snake species richness in relation to environmental gradients and biomes across continental North America. Location: North America, excluding islands. Taxon: Squamata (lizards and snakes). Methods: We collated a suite of environmental variables (n = 10) and squamate species ranges (n = 1,152) in an equal-area grid system (100 × 100 km cells) spanning continental North America. We deconstructed the latitudinal diversity gradient of squamates and examined species richness patterns for all lizards, all snakes and several individual squamate clades. We used multiple linear regressions to determine which environmental factors are most important for each squamate clade. Finally, we documented species richness within biomes and tested for correlations between species richness and biome variety. Results: Squamates exhibit a strong latitudinal diversity gradient across continental North America. Snakes are more widespread and have a stronger gradient than lizards. Our multiple linear regression results indicate strong associations between species richness and environmental variables for all individual squamate clades analysed; temperature variables are strongly positively correlated with species richness. Biome variety is more strongly correlated with lizard species richness than snake species richness. Squamates are most species-rich in tropical/subtropical forests, deserts and mangroves. Main conclusions: Most snake clades in North America exhibit strong latitudinal diversity gradients, but only two lizard clades, Dactyloidae (anoles) and Gekkota (geckos), display strong gradients and thus drive the overall lizard pattern. Squamate clades differ in their responses to environmental gradients, as reflected by their species richness patterns, with warmer climates generally harboring more species. Lizards are more strongly associated with habitat heterogeneity than snakes are, consistent with results from previous studies.

The Balbina Hydroelectric Dam of Central Brazilian Amazonia inundated 312,900 ha of primary forests and created approximately 3500 variable-sized islands that still harbor vertebrate populations after nearly 3 decades after isolation. We estimated the species richness, abundance, biomass, composition, and group size of medium- to large-bodied forest vertebrates in response to patch, landscape, and habitat-quality metrics across 37 islands and 3 continuous forest sites throughout the Balbina archipelago. We conducted 1168 km of diurnal censuses and had 12,420 camera-trapping days along 81 transects with 207 camera stations. We determined the number of individuals (or groups) detected per 10 km walked and the number of independent photographs per 10 camera-trapping days, respectively, for each species. We recorded 34 species, and patch area was the most significant predictor of vertebrate population relative abundance and aggregate biomass. The maximum group size of several group-living species was consistently larger on large islands and in continuous patches than on small islands. Most vertebrate populations were extirpated after inundation. Remaining populations are unlikely to survive further ecological disruptions. If all vertebrate species were once widely distributed before inundation, we estimated that approximately 75% of all individual vertebrates were lost from all 3546 islands and 7.4% of the animals in all persisting insular populations are highly likely to be extirpated. Our results demonstrate that population abundance estimates should be factored into predictions of community disassembly on small islands to robustly predict biodiversity outcomes.

Here, we explore an extension of that concept to biological invasions. We compare biogeographical patterns in native and non-native beetle (Coleoptera) assemblages from around the world to test whether beetle invasions represent a random sample of species or whether some families are more prone to invade than others. Location: Global. Methods: Numbers of non-native beetle species established in ten regions worldwide were compared with the land area of each region. The distribution of species among families was compared with the distribution among families for all species native to the same region and with the distribution among families for the global pool of all known beetle species. Ordination analysis was used to characterize differences among native and non-native assemblages based upon the distribution of species among families. Results: We report a total of 1,967 non-native beetle species across all ten regions, and a classic log–log relationship between numbers of species per region and land area though relationships are generally stronger for native assemblages. Some families (e.g., Dermestidae and Bostrichidae) are over-represented and others (e.g., Carabidae, Scarabaeidae and Buprestidae) are under-represented in non-native assemblages. The distribution of species among families is generally similar among native assemblages with greatest similarities among nearby regions. In contrast, non-native species assemblages are more similar to each other than to native species assemblages. Main conclusions: Certain families are over-represented, and others are under-represented in non-native beetle assemblages compared to native assemblages, indicating “invasion disharmony” in the global representation of beetle families.

Edmonton is the northernmost city in North America with a population of over one million, and an industrial and transportation gateway for much of northern Canada. Lichen-based biomonitoring could be a tool to track airborne pollutants resulting from Edmonton’s growing populace and industrial activity. The first step towards such a program is documenting the diversity and distribution of lichens in the city. To accomplish this, we conducted a city-wide, systematic survey of 191 sites focused on epiphytes growing on deciduous boulevard trees. We augmented that survey with surveys of rare trees, opportunistic collections from river valley and ravine habitats, herbarium collections, phylogenetic analyses of a subset of collections, and observations submitted to online nature-reporting applications. We present ITS sequence barcode data for 33 species, phylogenetic analyses for Candelariaceae, Endocarpon, Flavopunctelia, the Lecanora dispersa group, Lecidella, Peltigera, Physconia, and Punctelia, and detailed descriptions of 114 species in 47 genera and 23 families. Two species are hypothesized to be new to North America (Endocarpon aff. unifoliatum, Lecidella albida), twelve more are new to Alberta (Amandinea dakotensis, Bacidia circumspecta, Candelaria pacifica, Candelariella antennaria, Heterodermia japonica, Lecania naegelii, Lecanora sambuci, Lecanora stanislai, Lecidea erythrophaea, Peltigera islandica, Phaeocalicium aff. tremulicola, and the introduced Xanthoria parietina), and five are putative new species to science (Physcia aff. dimidiata, Physcia aff. stellaris, Phaeocalicium sp., Phaeocalicium aff. tremulicola, Lichenaceae sp.). Illustrations are provided for all species to aid in verification and public outreach. Species richness was highest in foliose lichens (48), followed by crustose and calicioid lichens and allied fungi (41), with the lowest richness in fruticose lichens (25). We did a preliminary assessment of the suitability of species for citizen-science biomonitoring by assessing their distribution across the city, perceptibility to the public, identification accuracy, and, for a subset, how consistently species were surveyed by trained novices. Compared to other urban areas where lichen diversity has been studied, Edmonton is relatively species-rich in calicioids and Peltigera. Promising bioindicators may be limited to chlorolichens, including Caloplaca spp., Evernia mesomorpha, Flavopunctelia spp., Phaeophyscia orbicularis, Physcia adscendens, Physcia aipolia group, Physcia aff. stellaris, Usnea spp., and Xanthomendoza fallax. Other genera that may be responsive to pollutants such as Cladonia and Peltigera were almost exclusively restricted to river valley and ravine ecosystems, limiting their application as bioindicators. Some species commonly used as biomonitors elsewhere were too rare, small, poorly developed, or obscured by more common species locally (e.g., Candelaria concolor s.l., Xanthomendoza hasseana). The low overlap with lists of biomonitoring species from other regions of North America illustrates the necessity of grounding monitoring in knowledge of local diversity.

Here, we explore how pelagic fish species diversity relates to functional diversity by sampling two locations, which, on the basis of biogeography, environmental conditions and human pressures, were expected to host pronounced differences in species composition and abundances and therefore functionality. Strings of five drifting mid-water Baited Remote Underwater Video Systems were used to survey pelagic vertebrate diversity and abundance in two isolated oceanic island systems, the Malpelo Fauna and Flora Sanctuary—a large, 25-year-old marine protected area—and an unprotected area in Cape Verde. Functional diversity, which offers insight into a community’s resilience against disturbance, was analysed using six key functional traits of marine fishes. Abundance was recorded as MaxN, the maximum number of individuals of a given species in a single frame during the 2-h deployment time. Cape Verde showed high overall abundance (Total MaxN 873) and low biomass (3559 kg), with a predominance of smaller fishes. Malpelo showed high biomass (7839 kg) but lower abundance (Total MaxN 465), with a predominance of large species. Species and functional diversity were marginally different between locations. Multivariate analysis of species relative abundances showed significant divergence between locations, although community functional traits overlapped strongly, suggesting that both communities share a similar structure and vulnerability. The existence of a common functional ‘backbone’ in diverging species communities across the oceans, under different productivity regimes, and under different protection levels, suggests that although pelagic communities may differ considerably in terms of species composition, this does not translate into a differing functional structure and resilience potential.

To explain the proportions of these species groups in grid cells, using Generalized Additive Models, we tested the effects of three categories of predictors: i) urban structure, represented by the distance from the city centre, population density, soil sealing, and quality of residential environment index, ii) habitat predictors, represented by habitat diversity and geologic diversity, and iii) environmental conditions, represented by urban heat island (UHI). Species richness decreases with the distance from the city centre and is highest in the cells with intermediate habitat diversity.

The proportion of archaeophytes is higher where habitats are more diverse and increases with the distance from the city centre. Grid cells with highest proportion of neophytes are located in the most built-up areas and in the city centre, which is positively associated with soil sealing, but negatively with UHI.

Most previous studies of northern lake biodiversity responses to environmental changes have focused on only a single organismal group. Investigations at whole-lake scales that integrate different habitats and trophic levels are currently rare, but highly necessary for future lake monitoring and management. We analysed spatial biodiversity patterns of 74 sub-Arctic lakes in Norway, Sweden, Finland, and the Faroe Islands with monitoring data for at least three biological focal ecosystem components (FECs)—benthic diatoms, macrophytes, phytoplankton, littoral benthic macroinvertebrates, zooplankton, and fish—that covered both pelagic and benthic habitats and multiple trophic levels. We calculated the richnessrelative (i.e. taxon richness of a FEC in the lake divided by the total richness of that FEC in all 74 lakes) and the biodiversity metrics (i.e. taxon richness, inverse Simpson index (diversity), and taxon evenness) of individual FECs using presence–absence and abundance data, respectively. We then investigated whether the FEC richnessrelative and biodiversity metrics were correlated with lake abiotic and geospatial variables. We hypothesised that (1) individual FECs would be more diverse in a warmer and wetter climate (e.g. at lower latitudes and/or elevations), and in hydrobasins with greater forest cover that could enhance the supply of terrestrial organic matter and nutrients that stimulated lake productivity; and (2) patterns in FEC responses would be coupled among trophic levels. Results from redundancy analyses showed that the richnessrelative of phytoplankton, macrophytes, and fish decreased, but those of the intermediate trophic levels (i.e. macroinvertebrates and zooplankton) increased with decreasing latitude and/or elevation. Fish richnessrelative and diversity increased with increasing temporal variation in climate (temperature and/or precipitation), ambient nutrient concentrations (e.g. total nitrogen) in lakes, and woody vegetation (e.g. taiga forest) cover in hydrobasins, whereas taxon richness of macroinvertebrates and zooplankton decreased with increasing temporal variation in climate. The similar patterns detected for richnessrelative of fish, macrophytes, and phytoplankton could be caused by similar responses to the environmental descriptors, and/or the beneficial effects of macrophytes as habitat structure. By creating habitat, macrophytes may increase fish diversity and production, which in turn may promote higher densities and probably more diverse assemblages of phytoplankton through trophic cascades. Lakes with greater fish richnessrelative tended to have greater average richnessrelative among FECs, suggesting that fish are a potential indicator for overall lake biodiversity. Overall, the biodiversity patterns observed along the environmental gradients were trophic-level specific, indicating that an integrated food-web perspective may lead to a more holistic understanding of ecosystem biodiversity in future monitoring and management of high-latitude lakes. In future, monitoring should also focus on collecting more abundance data for fish and lower trophic levels in both benthic and pelagic habitats.

Constructing permanent plots and monitoring them long-term has been regarded as an important and effective method for solving the challenge of soil animal biodiversity loss.

Results: First, we must confirm which scientific questions need to be solved and decide the basic principles to be observed for scientific investigation and monitoring in permanent plots of agricultural soil animals. Eighteen scientific questions have been proposed from a basic theory and practical application standpoint, and four basic principles have been proposed: Integrating the needs and ideas of scientific research and agricultural practice, scientific setting and selecting monitoring indices, concerning spatio-temporal heterogeneity and detection probability of monitoring indices, and emphasizing the effects of agricultural productions and human activities. Second, we need to standardize the terminology for long-term investigation and monitoring, such as site, plot, square, sample and specimen.

Then, the large permanent plot of agricultural soil animal can be established in terms of BCI 50-ha field protocols. Third, focusing on soil animal biodiversity and its effects on agricultural ecosystem health and function, we need to carry out long-term monitoring for four-class and twenty-seven-item scientific indices. Moreover, the field investigation and laboratory experiment should be performed based on a unified and standardized workflow. For field investigation, the working processes include drawing detailed sampling point map, training all investigators, looking for and locating the permanent plot of agricultural soil animals in the field using GPS or other instruments, labeling the sampling points in the permanent plot, and collecting samples.

Here, we studied the phylogeny and phylogeography of F. fruticum using two mitochondrial markers: cytochrome oxidase subunit I (COI) and 16S ribosomal RNA (16S); and four nuclear markers: 18S ribosomal RNA (18S), 28S ribosomal RNA (28S), internal transcribed spacer (ITS-2), and histone 3 (H3). The study was based on 59 populations sampled across the range. Whereas nuclear markers showed little differentiation, phylogenetic analysis of COI sequences clearly confirmed the distinctness of the European Fruticicola and Asian Bradybaena (p-distance 0.229). Within Fruticicola 54 haplotypes were detected, haplotype diversity (Hd) = 0.973 ± 0.006, nucleotide diversity (π) = 0.137 ± 0.005. ABGD and PTP delimitation analyzes distinguished eight mOTUs. Two sequences (our mOTU C) from Russia were published in the GenBank as two distinct species: F. schrenckii and F. transbaicalia. Seven further mOTUs identified in our study formed three distinct lineages, regarded as species. The first (mOTU A and mOTU B), represented by 40 populations, occupies a wide range across northern and central Europe, extending east to Ukraine and south to northern Croatia (mOTU B). It encompasses the type locality of F. fruticum, and can be recognized as F. fruticum sensu stricto. Another lineage (mOTU D and mOTU E), represented by six populations in central Romania, appears to form another species. Both mOTUs were found together in one population. A third lineage, containing mOTUs F, G and H, represented by 14 populations, was distributed across the Balkans from N.E. Croatia to Bulgaria. p-distances between the three species ranged from 0.172 to 0.219, and between all the mOTUs, pooled together, from 0.172 to 0.258. The highest genetic diversity was found in species 3 (0.112) and the lowest in species 1 (0.025), despite its largest geographic distribution. Pairwise p-distances, Tamura 3-parameter distances, composite likelihood distances, as well as the coancestry coefficient FST, calculated for all populations pooled together were significantly associated with geographic distance, but this was not the case within each of these three species. The significant association for all populations reflected high diversity between the species coupled with high geographic distances between their populations, not the character of intraspecies diversity. With a few exceptions, there hold a rather infinite island model with low migration. AMOVA detected 78% of the variance between the three species, 18% among populations within the species, and only 3.6% within the populations. The low genetic diversity of widespread F. fruticum s. stricto, compared with much higher diversity of two narrowly distributed newly found species of Fruticicola, may reflect the rapid spread of the former into previously uninhabitable regions, while the latter were able to maintain populations in glacial refugia. The estimated time of divergence between the three species, 1.7–2.19 mya, suggests their ancestors’ isolation in southern European refugia during the lower Pleistocene, the Gelasian/Calabrian. There was no clear association of variation in shell morphology and lineage or mOTU identity; on external characters, these species are semicryptic, subtle differences in reproductive anatomy among them were found. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.",,Island (Population);,,negative,10.1016/j.ympev.2022.107402,13018,10939,13019,E74UVPZH,journalArticle,2022,"Hofman, S.; Cameron, R.A.D.; Proćków, M.; Sîrbu, I.; Osikowski, A.; Jaszczyńska, A.; Sokół, M.; Falniowski, A.","Two new pseudocryptic species in the medium-sized common European land snails, Fruticicola Held, 1838; as a result of phylogeographic analysis of Fruticicola fruticum (O.

Despite permanent protections for some remnants, they continue to face anthropogenic threats including habitat fragmentation, invasive species, and climate change. Conservationists have sought to buffer remnants from threats using prairie restoration but limited research has assessed such practices at the landscape-level. We reexamine the flora of Mormon Island, the largest tract of lowland tallgrass prairie remaining in the Central Platte River Valley (CPRV) of Nebraska, USA, nearly 40-years after it was initially inventoried and following widespread restoration. We also conducted preliminary inventories of nearby Shoemaker Island and adjacent off-island habitats using an ecotope-based stratified random sampling approach. We examined change at Mormon Island between 1980-1981 and 2015–2020 and compared it to adjacent conservation lands using a number of vegetation indices. We documented 389 vascular plant species on Mormon Island, 405 on Shoemaker Island, and 337 on off-island habitats from 2015-2020, which represented an increase in native and exotic species richness on Mormon Island compared to 1980–1981 results. Floristic quality index (FQI) values increased at Mormon Island between 1980-1981 and 2015–2020. Paradoxically, the distribution of exotic-invasive species also expanded. Mormon Island from 2015-2020 was more similar to Shoemaker Island and off-island habitats from 2015-2020 than Mormon Island from 1980-1981. Widespread restoration introduced a number of high conservation value species native to Nebraska but novel to the CPRV, which improved FQIs despite increased exotic species invasion. These concurrent trends appear to have driven biological homogenization across the study area. Restoration did not fully buffer Mormon Island from exotic species invasion but it may have partially mitigated the impact considering the persistence of most native species across a 40-year period.

This study aimed to survey the spatial–temporal land degradation patterns and explore its driving mechanism based on a geographical detector in Hainan Island from 2000 to 2020. First, the areas of forest, cultivated land, and construction land were analysed, and their mutation year was determined through the Mann-Kendall abrupt test. Then, change vector analysis was used to create a double-evaluation system by combining the normalized difference vegetation index and net primary productivity. Finally, the geographical detector was used to identify the driving mechanism of different land-use types. The results show that 2013 was the mutation year of the three land-use types. From 2000 to 2013 (Stage 1), the land degradation areas of forest, cultivated land, construction land, grassland, and unutilised land reached 1977.13, 613.25, 165.81, 261.06, and 4.25 km2, respectively. From 2013 to 2020 (Stage 2), the degraded land area accounted for only 0.91 % of the island's total area. From the single factor perspective, the elevation (DEM), least distance to residential area (LDP), and variety of mean annual temperature (VTem) were found to be the dominant factors of land degradation of cultivated land and grassland, forest, construction land in Stage 1. On the other hand, in Stage 2, the main factor of land degradation was the variety of the density of GDP (VGDP) in cultivated land, grassland, and construction land, while it was the variety of mean annual precipitation (VPre) in the forest. Moreover, all pair-factors provided a higher determinant power for degraded land areas than a single factor. From the interaction effect perspective in Stage 1, VPOP ∩ LDR (i.e. the variety of the density of population density and least distance to roads or railways), LDP ∩ LDR, and VTem ∩ LDR were the most significant pair-factors of the interaction effect on land degradation of cultivated land, forest and grassland, and construction land. In Stage 2, the most significant pair-factors of the interaction effect in different land-use types were DEM ∩ VPOP and VPre ∩ POP in degraded cultivated land, VPre ∩ DEM and VPre ∩ LDR in degraded forest land, DEM ∩ VTem in degraded grassland, and VGDP ∩ LDR in degraded construction land.

Ö. 2023. Paleoecological investigation of the Miocene (23.03-5.33 mya) rodents (Mammalia: Rodentia) in Anatolia. Bulletin of the Mineral Research and Exploration 170, 15-30 (doi: https://doi.org/10.19111/ bulletinofmre.1139009), there are several uncited or quoted passages. For this, the authors apologise to the readers. In this paper, additional explanations are reported and necessary corrections are made in defective parts of the article. 1. In the first paragraph of the page 15, there is an uncited/quoted passage which was corrected as in the following: Order Rodentia is suggested to have first appeared in the Late Paleocene (Hartenberger, 1998) and the Early Paleocene (Wu et al., 2012). This group includes more than 40% of the entire mammals, with 30 families and over 2.000 species (Carleton and Musser, 2005). The addition of paleontological findings to these numbers may provide a better understanding regarding the diversity of rodents (Chaline and Mein, 1979). Their worldwide distribution except Antarctica and some oceanic islands reflects that they have adapted to almost all habitat types (Erdal, 2017). 2. In the second paragraph of the page 15, there is an uncited/quoted passage which was corrected as in the following: The Anatolian mainland was formed by the collision of the Arabian Plate with Eurasia in the Middle Miocene. The elevation of Anatolia provided a land bridge, allowing for the trans-continental migration of species (Şengör, 1980). The formation of Paratethys Sea was completed in the Oligocene, and terrestrial areas around it increased during the Early Miocene (Rögl, 1999). Connections formed over the Indian Ocean during the Middle Miocene. Towards the end of this period, migration routes between Paratethys and the Mediterranean closed off as a result of the collision between Eurasia and the Arabian Plate (Rögl, 1999). Land masses expanded due to the gradual retraction of Paratethys during the Miocene, and therefore, the fossil records in Anatolia are mostly recognized in Neogene terrestrial deposits (Kaya, 2017). 3. In the second paragraph of the page 16, there is an uncited/quoted passage which was corrected as in the following: The fossil pollen analyses indicate the existence of open habitats in Central and Western Anatolia during the Early Miocene, as well as moist and swampy habitats in the western parts (Akgün et al., 2007; Akkiraz et al., 2011; Kayseri Özer et al., 2014). Ecological environments with humid forests are also reported in Anatolia in the Early Miocene (Fortelius et al., 2014). Page 16, Material and Methods Citation for the NOW database is not Fortelius et al. 2014, it must be like this: The NOW Community (2023). New and Old Worlds Database of Fossil Mammals (NOW). Licenced under CC BY 4.0. Retrieved (year of data download) from https://nowdatabase.org/now/database/. 4. In the first paragraph of the section 3.2 (Middle Miocene Rodentia from Anatolia and Their Localities) in page 20, there is an uncited/quoted passage which was corrected as in the following: Although the paleoecological structure of the Middle Miocene is similar to that of the Early Miocene, the tropical regions shifted towards the north during this period because of expanding glaciation. As tropical areas expanded over Eurasia, the mammalian diversity in these regions also increased (Kaya, 2017). 5. In the first paragraph of the Result section in page 25, there is an uncited/quoted passage which was corrected as in the following: During the Early Miocene, Anatolia had a paleoenvironment with low seasonality and the mammal species adapted to humid environments (Fortelius et al, 2014). 6. In the last paragraph in page 25, there is an uncited/quoted passage which was corrected as in the following: The Middle Miocene is generally characterised by humid habitats, but dry areas are also known to sporadically exist (Fortelius et al., 2002). 7. In the first paragraph in page 26, there is an uncited/quoted passage which was corrected as in the following: During the Middle Miocene, the diversity of family Gliridae declined drastically which also coincides with the increase in biodiversity of murines and emergence of open habitats (Kaya and Kaymakçı, 2013). The Anatolian land is known to have experienced warmer temperatures and a humid paleoecology during the Middle Miocene (Akkiraz et al., 2011), however, hypsodonty measurements suggest the existence of more open, grassland ecosystems here (Fortelius et al., 2014). The discovery of Gliridae species in Anatolia points to the existence of deciduous forests during the Middle Miocene (Kaya and Kaymakçı, 2013). 8. In the third paragraph in page 26, there is an uncited/quoted passage which was corrected as in the following: A glimpse at the paleoecology of the Late Miocene suggests widespread presence of open habitats and an increase in the number of open land adapted mammal species. The dominance of open areas during this period led to a change in the fauna, and the period is characterized by Myomimus species (Kaya and Kaymakçı, 2013). Furthermore, fossil pollen analyses yielded a dry ecology throughout the inner parts of Anatolia (Akgün et al., 2007). 9. In the first paragraph in page 27, there is an uncited/quoted passage which was corrected as in the following: Members of the family Gliridae are reported in the Late Eocene and diversify in the Miocene (Freudenthal, 1997). In Anatolia, this family is represented by the genera Gliridinus, Glis, Vasseuromys, Microdyromys, Paraglirulus, Miodyromys, and Bransatoglis ((Kaya and Kaymakçı, 2013). In Europe and Eastern Mediterranean, environmental changes from the Middle to the Late Miocene led to a dramatic decline in the population of Gliridae species. 10. In the last part of first paragraph in page 27, there is an uncited/quoted passage which was corrected as in the following: In the family extant Gliridae in Turkey, unlike the genus Myomimus, Dryomys has adapted for climbing trees. While Myomimus lives in wooded parts of the open areas in Anatolia, Dryomys prefers bushy and mountainous forests (Kurtonur and Özkan, 1991; Nowak, 1999; Holden, 2005). © 2023 General Directorate of Mineral Research and Exploration (MTA).

To address this issue, it is imperative to maintain up-to-date biological inventories, as they serve as a primary source of information for the conservation of species and ecosystems. However, the maintenance of systematic inventories of vascular plants in Chile is virtually non-existent, especially outside protected wilderness areas. The data we have come from an inventory of vascular plant species along a stretch of coastal road in Puerto Cisnes (Aysén Region), characterised by a cut slope in the rock. The site is located between mountain ranges, in a region known for its protected wilderness areas and low levels of anthropogenic alteration. The study adopted an observational sampling design, using the road as a transect. For each species identified, the growth substrate, habit and dispersal mode were recorded. A total of 70 species (36 herbs, 23 shrubs and 11 trees) belonging to 42 families were found. The most represented families were Hymenophyllaceae (nine species) and Myrtaceae (four species). We recorded nine introduced species belonging to seven botanical families (Cirsium vulgare (Savi) Ten., Crocosmia crocosmiiflora (Lemoine ex Burb. & Dean) N.E.Br., Cytisus scoparius (L.) Link, Digitalis purpurea L., Lotus pedunculatus Cav., Plantago lanceolata L., Polygonum campanulatum Hook. f., Prunella vulgaris L., Rubus constrictus Lefèvre & P.J.Müll). Of these nine species, seven are invasive, while the remaining two species have not been assessed for invasive potential (i.e. Crocosmia crocosmiiflora and Polygonum campanulatum). In particular, Crocosmia crocosmiiflora and Rubus constrictus are new regional records. The majority of species were found growing on the ground (44 species), while a significant proportion were found exclusively on rocky slopes (17 species). According to their seed dispersal mechanism, the most common syndromes were anemochory (32 species) and ornithochory (20 species). Other mechanisms such as mammalochory, ballochory or myrmecochory were less common (less than four species). New information This study provides valuable data on the vascular flora of Puerto Cisnes, Chile, a modest human settlement in a minimally altered landscape. The region, dominated by native forests and a burgeoning salmon farming industry, has few inventories, so the database presented here adds significantly to local botanical knowledge. The main novelty of this research is that it is the first inventory carried out on a road in a slightly altered area surrounded by protected wilderness areas (such as Magdalena Island National Park and Queulat National Park). The study systematically categorises species according to substrate, habitat and dispersal mode, dimensions that are rarely combined in a single database. The inventory identifies 70 species (36 herbs, 23 shrubs and 11 trees) in 42 families. The most represented families were Hymenophyllaceae (with nine species) and Myrtaceae (with four species). Additionally, we recorded, two introduced species (Crocosmia crocosmiiflora and Rubus constrictus) at least 100 km south of their known distribution. © Pincheira-Ulbrich J.

We investigated the functional diversity and functional trait filtering of aerial insectivorous bats in both insular forest patches created by a vast ~30-year-old hydropower reservoir and the adjacent mainland continuous forest in Central Amazonia. Bats were surveyed using passive bat recorders across 34 forest sites. Based on a set of morphological traits derived for each species recorded, we estimated both the bat functional richness, functional evenness and functional dispersion at each surveyed site. We further assessed the effects of local vegetation, patch and landscape features on patterns of functional diversity. The interaction between functional traits, environmental characteristics, and species distribution was investigated using a combination of RLQ and fourth-corner analyses. We found that mainland sites retained higher functional richness and lower functional evenness compared to forest islands, indicating a more complete functional assemblage in the mainland. Additionally, species composition was affected by local vegetation structure and forest area, with small isolated islands exhibiting pervasive loss of functional traits. RLQ and fourth-corner analyses showed that larger understorey foraging species with greater dispersal capacity, constant frequency–frequency modulated calls, and higher frequency of maximum energy were associated with more isolated small islands. Conversely, forest subcanopy species, exhibiting quasi-constant frequency calls and presenting low dispersal capacity were associated with continuous forests and islands with greater forest area, and were therefore more sensitive to habitat insularization. Our study calls attention to the pervasive impacts induced by large dams on the functional diversity of tropical insectivorous bats. We recommend that future assessments of the effects of habitat fragmentation on mammals should include traits linked to ecosystem services. In designing and licensing new dams, we suggest the creation of extensive protected areas surrounding mainland forests to minimize the detrimental impacts of small isolated islands and safeguard the full complement of key ecological functions provided by insectivorous bats.

Relative abundance data for 41,594 individual fish belonging to 121 species was collected, 87 functional entities were identified, and functional diversity and vulnerability estimated based on five functional traits. The influence of spatial and environmental variability and human impact on functional entity composition and richness were also assessed. Galapagos reef fish communities have a high vulnerability to reduced functional diversity if species are lost due to the low redundancy and high sensitivity of reef fish functional entities. However, there may be some ecosystem resilience against species loss from species filling ecologically similar niches instead of redundant species filling the same niche.

Location: Eastern Carpathian Mountains, Romania, Europe. Methods: We fitted linear and generalized linear models (LM and GLM) to examine whether pond area and current distance from the Olt River predict plant species richness, Shannon diversity and relative cover of different social behaviour types and overall plant species richness and Shannon diversity. Using historical maps, we measured pond distance from the river ca. 60 years before the Olt River was regulated, and we refitted the LM and GLM models using pond area and past distance from the river as independent variables. Results: Total plant species richness increased with pond area, and it decreased with the distance from the river, but total plant Shannon diversity index was affected, positively, only by pond area. The strength of responses to pond area and connectivity of species richness, Shannon diversity and relative cover varied across the different social behaviour types. Past and current distances between ponds and riverbeds had similar effects on plant diversity, with some evidence for stronger effect of the present connectivity on specialist species Shannon diversity and a weaker effect on disturbance tolerants, generalists and competitors.

We collated presence data from public databases of species distributions, a literature review, and personal communications with resource managers and researchers.

However, pure covers are hard to obtain without substantial management, and mixed covers—wherein some spontaneous species coexist with sown cover crops—seem to be a good alternative. Greater insight into factors influencing the composition and density of the spontaneous plant community is needed to achieve relatively good control of the performances of this mixed cover. Here we addressed two questions: 1) How does the functional structure of communities with a highly competitive sown cover crop and/or high initial species diversity differ from the functional structure of communities with the opposite characteristics? 2) Can aboveground species traits explain interactions between cover crops and spontaneous species present in the same community? In a fallowed field in Guadeloupe (West French Indies), we studied communities composed of one sown cover crop species and spontaneous species growing simultaneously in the plot. The study was conducted along two unrelated experimentally-devised gradients resulting from cropping practices: a competitivity gradient of a sown cover crop species and an initial species diversity gradient resulting from an initial soil perturbation induced by the false seedbed technique. These factors (soil tillage modality before cover crop sowing and cover crop species identity) were combined in a split-plot design. Seven and twelve months after cover crop sowing, community species densities and biomasses were assessed. Leaf trait values of the 12 most present species were measured at flowering to describe the functional structure of the community using the community weighted trait means and variances, and a functional diversity index. Our results showed high functional divergence in communities with highly competitive cover crops, which suggests differentiation of functional niches between species, but no clear differences in communities with high and low initial species diversity. We also showed that the studied species were positioned along a gradient from acquisitive to conservative strategies of resource capture and use according to their leaf trait values, regardless of their type (cover crops or spontaneous species), and that cover crop species had higher trait values related to size than spontaneous species. Finally, we demonstrated that interactions between cover crops and spontaneous species could be better explained by the cover crop dynamic height or community biomasses than by the measured aboveground functional traits and that the plant growth habit had a central role.

However, floral communities associated with traffic-related green spaces are rarely considered valuable elements of urban green infrastructure (UGI). Objectives: The main objective of this work was to assess if traffic-related green spaces in Finland possess species-rich floral communities and can assist urban ecological restoration—converting degraded areas into functionally diverse ecosystems. Thus, we evaluated richness, cover, and community composition of insect-pollinated plants (emphasizing flowering ones) on traffic islands, parking lots, and road verges. Methods: The assessment was performed during the mean flowering phenophase of insect-pollinated plants in the European boreal zone (July and August) using a standard quadrat (1 m2) placement method. We studied plants in urban and suburban locations of three highly populated (> 170 000 inhabitants) Finnish cities—Helsinki, Tampere, and Turku. There were 90 sampling sites with 15 replicates per location type in each city and five measurement replicates per green space (habitat) type. The species richness, cover, and composition were assessed in relation to location, habitat type, city, the average daily traffic (ADT), and distance to the road. Results: Urban locations had lower total plant species richness and fewer indicator species (characterized only by a single indicator species) compared to suburban locations (characterized by five indicator species). Species richness of plants flowering during the time of the survey did not differ among locations. Traffic islands were richer habitats for flowering plants than road verges but did not differ from parking lots. Total vegetation cover and cover of insect-pollinated flowering plants increased with an increasing distance from the road. Vegetation cover differed among habitats being higher on road verges than on traffic islands irrespective of ADT. In all habitat types, the two most common flowering species were yarrow Achillea millefolium and autumn hawkbit Leontodon autumnalis which occurred at 70.2% and 67.8% of the sampling sites, respectively. However, the mean cover of the ten most common flowering species (when present) was low and varied between 1.5 and 9.5% per m2. Conclusions: Similar richness of flowering plants (but not total plant species) in urban and suburban locations might indicate equal importance of ecosystem services provided by flowering plants in cities irrespective of location. Because traffic islands and parking lots contain rich plant communities, they should be better integrated into UGI and valued by city planners. Management intensity in terms of grass cuts should be ecologically justified.

We compare species-area relationships for mixed-species flocks to those for the entire bird community and determine how ‘nuclear’ species, those important to flock formation or cohesion, which often have functional traits such as intraspecific gregariousness, influence flock species richness. We hypothesized that mixed flocks would only form on large islands where nuclear species are present. On the subset of larger islands, we expected flock species richness to rise with island area, reflecting a larger pool of species. Location: Thirty-one islands of varying area in the reservoir system of Thousand Island Lake, China. Taxon: The resident forest bird community and its subcomponent of flock participants. Similar to elsewhere in southern China, the primary nuclear species was Huet's Fulvetta (Alcippe hueti), which averaged 20 individuals per flock, and led the flocks when present. Methods: Birds were surveyed in the winter of 2017 and the autumn of 2021. Results: The probability for a flock to be present, and the species richness of birds per transect, increased with island area, but the species richness of flocks did not. Flocks with Huet's Fulvetta were only found on islands larger than 30 ha. Flocks on smaller islands formed around secondary nuclear species typical of northern Chinese flocks. Main Conclusion: Gregariousness as a functional trait may make nuclear species more susceptible to disappearing in small fragments, leading to flock collapse. The extreme gregariousness of fulvettas may also act to increase competition in the flocks they lead and limit the flocks' species richness.

However, little is known about the effects of canyons on fish biodiversity, in particular on oceanic islands, which are imbedded in regions of low productivity. Using submersibles and high-definition video surveys, we investigated demersal fish assemblages in two submarine canyons and slope areas off the island of Moloka'i, Hawai'i, at depths ranging from 314 to 1100m. We addressed the interactions between the abundance, species richness and composition of the fish assemblage, and organic matter input and habitat heterogeneity, testing the hypotheses that heterogeneous bottom habitats and higher organic matter input in canyons enhance demersal fish abundance, and species density, richness and diversity, thereby driving differences in assemblage structure between canyons and slopes. Sediment type, substrate inclination, water-mass properties (temperature and dissolved oxygen) and organic matter input (modeled POC flux and percent detritus occurrence) were put into multivariate multiple regression models to identify potential drivers of fish assemblage structure. A total of 824 fish were recorded during ~13h of video yielding 55 putative species. Macrouridae was the most diverse family with 13 species, followed by Congridae (5), Ophidiidae (4) and Halosauridae (3). Assemblage structure changed markedly with depth, with the most abrupt change in species composition occurring between the shallowest stratum (314-480m) and intermediate and deep strata (571-719m, 946-1100m). Chlorophthalmus sp. dominated the shallow stratum, macrourids and synaphobranchid eels at intermediate depths, and halosaurs in the deepest stratum. Assemblages only differed significantly between canyon and slope habitats for the shallow stratum, and the deep stratum at one site. Dissolved oxygen explained the greatest proportion of variance in the multivariate data, followed by POC flux and percent organic-detritus occurrence. Fish abundances were generally higher in canyons but only statistically significant for the deepest stratum. Reduced fish abundances both in canyon and slope transects occurred at intermediate depths within the core of the oxygen minimum zone (OMZ). Species density, diversity and richness and abundance were usually higher in the canyons, but only statistically higher in the deepest stratum. Possible causes for increased abundance and species densities and richness in the deepest stratum in canyons include reduced disturbance at deeper depths.

Temporal patterns of endemic and widespread species descriptions in the European fauna,"Essl, F; Rabitsch, W; Dullinger, S; Moser, D; Milasowszky, N",2013,GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND BIOGEOGRAPHY,,10.1111/j.1466-8238.2012.00787.x,"Aim To analyse if the historical species description process in 10 animal groups differed among widespread and endemic species and to evaluate whether our current knowledge about the diversity of these groups is complete. Location Sixty-nine terrestrial regions (countries, large islands, archipelagos) covering all of Europe. Methods Based on data from the Fauna Europaea project, we reconstructed the description histories of four vertebrate groups (amphibians, fish, mammals, reptiles) and six well-studied invertebrate groups (butterflies, grasshoppers, ground beetles, snails, spiders, true bugs) living in terrestrial and freshwater environments. We used accelerated failure time models to test for a possible delay of endemic species detection and to provide conservative estimates of the as yet undescribed proportions of the existing diversity. Results Our data set includes 24,092 species, of which 7202 (30%) are endemic to one Fauna Europaea region. Species descriptions over time follow different trajectories for endemic and widespread species, with endemic species being described 79 years later than widespread ones, on average. Rates of widespread species descriptions have been low throughout the 20th century despite increasing numbers of active taxonomists, and models indicate that only a minor fraction of extant species is unknown (0.43%). By contrast, endemic species accumulation curves do not seem to have levelled off yet. Conservative model predictions suggest that up to 19% of the existing endemic diversity still awaits description in some taxonomic groups. Conclusions Our results suggest that even for well-studied groups in the world's biogeographically best-known continent, scientific knowledge of species richness is far from complete and is biased towards widespread species.

Location Sixty-nine terrestrial regions (countries, large islands, archipelagos) covering all of Europe. Methods Based on data from the Fauna Europaea project, we reconstructed the description histories of four vertebrate groups (amphibians, fish, mammals, reptiles) and six well-studied invertebrate groups (butterflies, grasshoppers, ground beetles, snails, spiders, true bugs) living in terrestrial and freshwater environments. We used accelerated failure time models to test for a possible delay of endemic species detection and to provide conservative estimates of the as yet undescribed proportions of the existing diversity. Results Our data set includes 24,092 species, of which 7202 (30%) are endemic to one Fauna Europaea region. Species descriptions over time follow different trajectories for endemic and widespread species, with endemic species being described 79 years later than widespread ones, on average. Rates of widespread species descriptions have been low throughout the 20th century despite increasing numbers of active taxonomists, and models indicate that only a minor fraction of extant species is unknown (0.43%). By contrast, endemic species accumulation curves do not seem to have levelled off yet. Conservative model predictions suggest that up to 19% of the existing endemic diversity still awaits description in some taxonomic groups. Conclusions Our results suggest that even for well-studied groups in the world's biogeographically best-known continent, scientific knowledge of species richness is far from complete and is biased towards widespread species. Research and conservation priorities may thus be misdirected, as, for example, regions with high numbers of as yet unrecognized endemics may not be adequately considered when setting conservation priorities.

Methods We tested whether species traits and trait space vary between facultative (i.e. species that clean only during the juvenile stages or sporadically) and dedicated (i.e. species that clean during their whole lives) cleaner types. We compiled data from local checklists (relative richness) and belt transects (standardized richness and abundance). We built four models to test whether past and current isolation (i.e. distance from Quaternary refugia and biodiversity centres), sea temperature, primary productivity, local species pool and abundance of potential clients influenced the relative richness and abundance of cleaners.

14395,Diel variation affects estimates of biodiversity and abundance of nudibranch (Gastropoda) faunas,"Chang, YW; Chen, TC; Willan, RC; Mok, HK; Yu, MH",2013,NAUTILUS,,,"With approximately 3000 species worldwide, the Nudibranchia is numerically the largest group of sea slugs (Gastropoda: Heterobranchia). In most previous surveys on diversity and abundance of nudibranch faunas, researchers only undertook daytime surveys and neglected nighttime surveys for practical reasons. In order to assess whether such estimates are accurate if they are based only on daytime surveys, we undertook replicated diel (i.e., day and night) surveys for 12 consecutive months (from December 2009 to November 2010) at Shilang Marine Reserve, Green Island (Lyudao), Taiwan. We analyzed the species accumulation curves, diversity indices, and similarity of species composition as statistical estimates of overall biodiversity and species abundance. Fifty-three species of nudibranchs were recorded during all our surveys, but the cumulative number of species showed no sign of reaching a plateau at the end of our survey. We recorded 34 species during the daytime surveys and 42 species during the nighttime surveys. The mean number of species observed during the day and night was 6.3 and 8.9, respectively. Phyllidiella pustulosa was the species observed most often during the daytime surveys, while Tritonia sp. 1 (an undescribed species) was the most abundant species at night. Species composition was clearly different between day and night. Our results for this particular region of the tropical Indo-Pacific Ocean, which is adjacent to the ""Coral Triangle"" region of global maximum biodiversity of nudibranchs, lead us to conclude that estimates of faunal diversity and species composition within local communities (richness) are strongly influenced by whether surveys are conducted during the day or the night.

The organisms that are able to survive on these ecosystems frequently experience strong selective pressures and constrictions to gene flow with marine populations, which could contribute to genetic divergence among populations inhabiting coastal lagoon and marine environments. Therefore, the main aims of this study are to asses the genetic diversity and population structure of Holothuria arguinensis across geographical ranges, to test the hypothesis of coastal lagoons as hotspots of genetic diversity in the Ria Formosa lagoon, and to determine the role of exporting standing genetic variation from the lagoon to open sea and their implications to recent geographical expansion events.
 To reach these objectives, we investigate the genetic structure of H. arguinensis using two mitochondrial DNA markers (COI and 16S) at different spatial scales: i) small, inside Ria Formosa coastal lagoon, South Portugal; 2) large, including most of the geographical distribution of this species (South and Western Portuguese coast and Canary islands); these results will allow us to compare the genetic diversity of lagoonal and marine populations of H. arguinensis.

This study examines the distribution of invasive alien plant species relative to vegetation, site characteristics, and disturbance indicators in a relatively unfragmented matrix forest block (similar to 8,000 ha) in southern New England and provides the first quantitative description of the forested vegetation of this region. Within 139 - 10 X 10 in sample plots, percent ground coverage was estimated for each vascular plant species and basal area determined for all woody species reaching breast height (1.4 m). Site conditions, including topography, soil moisture and fertility, and evidence of current and historical site disturbance, were assessed to identify factors influencing invasive plant abundance. Fifteen relatively distinct vegetation types were identified using NMS ordination and cluster analysis, including wetland forest, terrestrial open woodland, and terrestrial closed canopy vegetation types. Of the 209 species occurring in sample plots, only 10 (4.8%) were invasive. Most abundant were Berberis thunbergii, Celastrus orbiculatus, and Rosa multiflora, each occurring in 5% or fewer plots. Moist sites were invaded most frequently, especially those with high species richness, lower canopy cover, and those dominated by Acer rubrum or Pinus strobus.

Soc. 136: 500-519. 2009.-Invasive plant species pose serious threats to ecosystem function and community diversity, dominating many natural systems through Suppression or, competition with, and replacement of native species. This study examines the distribution of invasive alien plant species relative to vegetation, site characteristics, and disturbance indicators in a relatively unfragmented matrix forest block (similar to 8,000 ha) in southern New England and provides the first quantitative description of the forested vegetation of this region. Within 139 - 10 X 10 in sample plots, percent ground coverage was estimated for each vascular plant species and basal area determined for all woody species reaching breast height (1.4 m). Site conditions, including topography, soil moisture and fertility, and evidence of current and historical site disturbance, were assessed to identify factors influencing invasive plant abundance. Fifteen relatively distinct vegetation types were identified using NMS ordination and cluster analysis, including wetland forest, terrestrial open woodland, and terrestrial closed canopy vegetation types. Of the 209 species occurring in sample plots, only 10 (4.8%) were invasive. Most abundant were Berberis thunbergii, Celastrus orbiculatus, and Rosa multiflora, each occurring in 5% or fewer plots. Moist sites were invaded most frequently, especially those with high species richness, lower canopy cover, and those dominated by Acer rubrum or Pinus strobus. Site disturbance, particularly roads, trails, and former land use, also was correlated with invasive abundance.

Uncertainty over the management of headwater areas and potential effects on sensitive species has led to our Riparian Buffer Study. Four integrated studies are being conducted within the experimental treatments of the ""Density Management Studies"" J. Tappeiner et al. (in this proceedings) to provide information to aid riparian reserve width decisions when forest thinning is conducted in headwaters. Pretreatment surveys to characterize 40 to 70 years-old managed Douglas-fir/western hemlock forest communities in latitudinal (perpendicular to) and longitudinal (along) profiles to streams have yielded new information about habitats and species conditions in unthinned managed headwater subdrainages.
 First, microsites and microclimates are being examined in transects perpendicular to streams. Pre-treatment results of these intact young stands show: 1) macroclimate conditions associated with site locations, versus microsite features such as vegetation and topography, often account for the majority of the variation observed in microclimate; 2) microsite conditions tend to be different within the first 15 m from streams, and rapidly approximate upland forest conditions at distances beyond about 15 m; 3) light levels are low and are often likely to be a limiting factor for understory development and 4) large woody debris is in primarily advanced decay stages, and little recruitment is occurring. These pre-thinning results provide a reference against which post-harvest impacts will be evaluated.; Second, stream habitats and their fish and amphibian fauna are being characterized at our managed forest headwater sites before thinning treatments are installed. The 15 species found in and along headwater streams sort into multiple distinct faunal assemblages, associated with different headwater microhabitats. Upslope, >2m from water, the assemblages collapse to primarily 2 amphibian species. Most relevant for headwater stream management in western Oregon forests is that torrent salamanders (under status review for United States Threatened and Endangered listing) are associated with discontinuous channels, the most frequent stream type at our headwater sites. Riparian management approaches (e.g., buffers, leave areas, harvest treatments) are recommended to identify and manage habitats of these critical populations in the uppermost headwaters.; Third, forest arthropod diversity of headwater areas is under investigation. Aquatic insect assemblages are compared between perennial and ephemeral stream segments (emergence traps). Terrestrial arthropod assemblages are compared between riparian zone, the upslope ""ecological break"" (interface between streamside and upland), and upland forest habitat (pitfall traps). The abundance of aquatic insects was greatest in ephemeral reaches due to higher numbers of Diptera (flies) ephemeral streams appear to play a disproportionately important role in forest aquatic ecology relative to this taxa. However, arthropod diversity was greater in perennial streams. Perpendicular to streams, terrestrial arthropod abundance was greater in riparian zones, where unique species occurrence was highest as well. Our pre-treatment results show that all species characteristic of the forest floor may be preserved within the riparian zone.; Fourth, lichens and bryophytes also are being examined in these managed forest stands. Diversity and abundance ""hotspots"" of these taxa are associated with managed forest microhabitats including riparian areas, hardwood gaps, remnant trees, and wolf trees. Our hypothesis is that creative thinning practices that preserve these habitat features can promote lichenbryophyte species richness and abundance. This hypothesis is being tested in the BLM Density Management project, which places 14 to 1 acre leave-islands around these features within an upslope thinning treatment. The responses of these taxa to various thinning densities also is being examined, through analysis of selected species' growth rates and pre- and post-thinning analyses of their communities.; In summary, pre-treatment findings from our integrated studies indicate:; Across all taxa, species thought to be associated with. late-successional, old-growth forest conditions are being found in our managed forest sites.; The near-stream environment in headwater landscapes is distinct from upslope areas relative to microsite and microclimate, and amphibian and arthropod diversity.; The array of water flow patterns in headwaters creates a complex habitat mosaic, in which unique arthropod and amphibian assemblages are found in the uppermost segments of the stream network.; Lichen and bryophyte diversity hotspots are tied to habitat features including riparian areas, hardwood gaps, remnant and wolf trees.; Under investigation are: 1) conservation of the integrity of near-stream and instream habitats and fauna with alternative Riparian Buffer widths in a thinning matrix; and 2) conservation of upslope habitats for biodiversity with alternative thinning densities, and creative thinning designs including patch upslope reserves (leave islands).",,Island (Population);,,negative,nan,0,1360,1,GAY9UFPD,journalArticle,2003,"Barré, N.; Bachy, P.",Complement to the list of the birds of New Caledonia,Alauda,,00024619 (ISSN),,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0038672025&partnerID=40&md5=08686e36ebe228a5d4ae2f144e92ed87,"Over the last five years, ten species of birds not previously known on the island have been seen, increasing the number of species/subspecies recorded in New Caledonia to about 192 taxa.

 In terrestrial plant communities, the relationship between native species diversity and exotic success is typically scale-dependent. It is often proposed that within local neighbourhoods, high native diversity limits resources, thereby inhibiting exotic success. However, environmental variation that manifests over space or time can create positive correlations between native diversity and exotic success at larger scales. In marine habitats, there have been few multi-scale surveys of this pattern, so it is unclear how diversity, resource limitation and the environment influence the success of exotic species in these systems.; Location; Washington, USA.; Methods; I analysed nested spatial and temporal surveys of fouling communities, which are assemblages of sessile marine invertebrates, to test whether the relationships between native richness, resource availability and exotic cover supported the diversity-stability and diversity-resistance theories, to test whether these relationships changed with spatio-temporal scale, and to explore the temperature preferences of native and exotic fouling species.; Results; Survey data failed to support diversity-stability theory: space availability actually increased with native richness at the local neighbourhood scale, and neither space availability nor variability decreased with native richness across larger spatio-temporal scales.

It is often proposed that within local neighbourhoods, high native diversity limits resources, thereby inhibiting exotic success. However, environmental variation that manifests over space or time can create positive correlations between native diversity and exotic success at larger scales. In marine habitats, there have been few multi-scale surveys of this pattern, so it is unclear how diversity, resource limitation and the environment influence the success of exotic species in these systems.; Location; Washington, USA.; Methods; I analysed nested spatial and temporal surveys of fouling communities, which are assemblages of sessile marine invertebrates, to test whether the relationships between native richness, resource availability and exotic cover supported the diversity-stability and diversity-resistance theories, to test whether these relationships changed with spatio-temporal scale, and to explore the temperature preferences of native and exotic fouling species.; Results; Survey data failed to support diversity-stability theory: space availability actually increased with native richness at the local neighbourhood scale, and neither space availability nor variability decreased with native richness across larger spatio-temporal scales.

Despite global efforts to address this challenge, the documented number of alien species is rapidly increasing worldwide. However, the magnitude of the impact of alien species may vary significantly across habitats. For example, some habitats are naturally less prone to biological invasions due to stringent abiotic and biotic characteristics, selecting for a limited number of introduced species possessing traits closely related to the native organisms. Subterranean ecosystems are quintessential examples of habitats with strong environmental filters (e.g. lack of light and scarcity of food), driving convergent adaptations in species that have successfully adapted to life in darkness. Despite these stringent environmental constraints, the number of records of alien species in subterranean ecosystems has increased in recent decades, but the relevant literature remains largely fragmented and mostly anecdotal.

While invasions by non-indigenous species are common and recognized as a significant conservation threat in terrestrial habitats of the Archipelago, little is known about the magnitude of invasions in its coastal marine waters. Based upon recent field surveys, available literature, and analysis of the biogeographic status of previously reported taxa, we report 53 non-indigenous species of marine invertebrates in the Galapagos Islands. Forty-eight (90.6%) of these species are newly reported or newly recognized as introduced, a nearly ten-fold increase from the five species previously recognized as nonindigenous. Of these 48 species, 30 (62.5%) were newly discovered in surveys commenced in 2015. Ascidians (11 species), bryozoans (10), polychaetes (9), and hydroids (8) account for 38 (71.7%) of the introduced species. Our analyses further detected 33 cryptogenic invertebrate and algal species and one littoral vascular plant. Most taxonomic groups remain to be assessed for the presence of non-indigenous species. Importantly, the recent field surveys were restricted predominantly to one habitat (harbor biofouling) on two islands, further suggesting that introduced species richness for the Galapagos Islands may be considerably higher. Most of the introduced species treated here were likely brought to the Galapagos by ships. While we presume that most if not all of the many thousands of vessels arriving in the Galapagos Islands since the 1500s had marine animals and plants attached to their hulls, we hypothesize that the general absence in the Islands of extensive shoreline structures (in the form of wharves, docks, pilings, and buoys) until the last half of the 20th century may have constrained extensive colonization by fouling species. The proliferation of shoreline structures may have both provided expanded habitat for non-indigenous species that had earlier colonized natural substrates, as well as having facilitated a 20th and 21st century wave of new invasions in the Galapagos Islands.

16664,MODE OF INTERCHANGES OF CONTINENTAL VERTEBRATES BETWEEN NORTH AND SOUTH-AMERICA DURING THE LATE CRETACEOUS AND PALEOCENE,"GAYET, M; RAGE, JC; SEMPERE, T; GAGNIER, PY",1992,BULLETIN DE LA SOCIETE GEOLOGIQUE DE FRANCE,,,"Interchanges of terrestrial vertebrates, including fresh water ones, between North and South America during the late Cretaceous and early Cainozoic have been rejected by most palaeontologists for a long time. This has resulted from the fact that, on palaeogeographic reconstructions based on geophysical data, South and North America are separated by a wide oceanic basin. As a consequence, palaeontologists have supposed that the noticed interchanges resulted from waif or island hopping dispersals. However, during the past few years, palaeontologists have agreed first that a land route was present between North and South America during the latest Cretaceous, and that this route still existed during the Palaeocene.
 Thus far, studies dealing with this problem have been based on tetrapod vertebrates only. In this study, data provided by tetrapods are listed and reevaluated. Moreover, information provided by fresh water fishes are taken into account and emphasized, since numerous fossils have been recently discovered in South America. Assuming that fossil fishes regarded as fresh water lineages were actually fresh water dwellers, these fishes are considered to be highly significant. Such fishes spread through continuous fresh water connections, i.e. their dispersal required unbroken land route with fresh water at the surface.; Exchanges are recorded in both directions. Hadrosaurid dinosaurs (as also, perhaps, ceratopsians if Notoceratops bonarellii is not a hadrosaurid) are the only terrestrial vertebrates which illustrate an ascertained North America-South America dispersal during the late Cretaceous. The mammal Cimolestes (Leptictidae) was also involved in a dispersal to South America, but it is not established whether this event took place during the latest Cretaceous or the Paleocene. Apart from these two reptilian groups, possibly Leptictidae and cypriniform fishes could represent immigrants from North America during the Maastrichtian, though this is till highly questionable.; Evidence of late Cretaceous and Palaeocene dispersals from South America to North America is stronger than in the opposite direction. They included fishes, reptiles and mammals. Lepisosteid fishes, at least the genus Lepisosteus, reached North America during the latest Cretaccous following a continental (fluviatile) route. Teiid lizards, aniliid and boid snakes, both families being of Gondwanian origin, entered North America in Maastrichtian time, along with titanosaurids (genus Alamosaurus), a dinosaur family widely distributed on Gondwanian continents. Several mammals passed from South America to North America during late Cretaceous and Palaeocene times : Caroloameghinidae entered North America in the latest Cretaceous: Pantodonta reached North America in the middle Palaeocene at the latest, whereas Didelphidae and Notoungulata arrived on that continent during the late Palaeocene.; Other continental vertebrates passed from South America to North America, but it is not established whether their dispersal occurred during the latest Cretaceous or the Paleocene. These vertebrates are phareodontine osteoglossid and ariid fishes, iguanid lizards, tropidopheid snakes and didolontid or phenacodontid and mioclaenine hyopsodontid mammals. It should be noted that it is not clearly established whether ariids were really fresh-water fishes; they were possibly littoral dwellers and they perhaps did not make use of a true terrestrial route but only followed shorelines.; Some vertebrates provide strong evidence of terrestrial interchange-but the direction of interchange remains indeterminate. So is Avisaurus of the Maastrichtian of both South and North America. Avisaurus is a member of Avisauridae, a family belonging either to theropod dinosaurs or to enantiornithes (flightless) birds. Also mammal Peradectes (Peradectidae) which according to several authors is considered to have entered either North America or South America as it is known at latest Cretaceous age in both continents.; Taphrosphys (bothremydid turtle), Hyposaurus (dysosaurid crocodile), and Nyctosaurus (cryorhynchid pterosaur) were vertebrates involved in dispersal. But, because of their habits aquatique andor aerial, their presence in both North and South America is not significantly indicative of a continuous land route : Taphrosphys (latest Cretaceous or Paleocene dispersal) and Hyposaurus (Maastrichtian dispersal) were littoral dwellers whereas Nyctosaurus (latest Cretaceous dispersal) was of aerial habits.; A few other groups which were involved in interchanges between indeterminate Gondwanian and Laurasian continents by late Cretaceous or Paleocene times could have taken part in inter-American dispersals. Ceratophryine frogs, sebecosuchian crocodiles, phorusrhacids, which were large flightless birds, and ratite birds dispersed northwards; their dispersal perhaps took place between the Americas, but crossing of the Tethyan area between Africa and Europe cannot be ruled out. The latter possibility seems likely, at least for ziphodont mesosuchians.; None of the groups involved in the interchanges appeared in both North America and South America prior to the Campanian. Consequently, it may be proposed that the exchanges began at that time. Few taxa took part in the interchanges at that time but their number increased during the Maastrichtian and Palaeocene.; Although latest Cretaccous and Palaeocene interchanges are well documented, it is of interest to note that several terrestrial groups of vertebrates which were often rather widely distributed either in the Laurasian realm or on Gondwanian continents in the late Cretaceous and the Paleocene, never crossed the central America area (and even did not cross any part of the Tethyan area) ; acipenserid, polyodontid and gonorhynchoid fishes, as well as palaeobatrachid frogs, baenid turtles, and anguimorph lizards inhabited North America during the Cretaceous; hiodontid and esocid fishes were present on that continent during the Palaeocene. None of these northern groups reached South America. Conversely, polypterid, chanid, characiform, and coelacanthiform fishes, as well as pipid frogs and araripemyid turtles, known in the Cretaceous of South America, did not enter North America. The above listed vertebrates rank among the most significant ones that did not take part in the late Cretaceous and Paleocene interchanges. Other groups could be added to this list but, for the time being, they cannot be considered to be very conclusive because their distribution is still inadequatly known.; The failure of various groups to cross the central America area would apparently favour the hypothesis of a discontinuous terrestrial route or even an island hopping hypothesis. But the ascertained dispersals of large-size animals such as Titanosauridae and of fresh water fishes (Lepisosteidae, Phareodontidae, and perhaps Ariidae) are inconsistent with such possibilities as they require a continuous land (fluviatile for the fishes) route. These failures could result from climatic factors, faunal interactions (niches occupied by ecologically vicarious autochthonous forms) or shortness of duration of the unbroken nature of the land route. Several brief phases of dispersal apparently took place during the late Cretaceous and Palaeocene in connection with emergence and submergence of parts of the land bridge.; Northward dispersals markedly outnumbered those in the southward direction. It is supposed that the central American land route which permitted the interchanges was first connected to South America. Thus, various South American vertebrates were able to colonize a latest Cretaceous ""Central America"" before it was also linked to North America. In such a case, South America faunas would have been advantaged.; The terrestrial bridges which linked North and South America by latest Cretaceous and Palaeocene times probably comprised the Greater Antilles and the Aves Ridge which consisted of a magmatic submitted to uplift and deformation between North and South America at that time. Part of this arc began to collide with both North and South America during the Campanian, an age which corresponds to the beginning of the faunal interchanges. Another volcanic arc was present at that time on the southwestern margin of the Caribbean plate but it was very probably highly discontinuous and therefore could not act as a land bridge.",,Island (Population);,Monitoring (Outcome);,negative,nan,0,1360,1,GAY9UFPD,journalArticle,2003,"Barré, N.; Bachy, P.",Complement to the list of the birds of New Caledonia,Alauda,,00024619 (ISSN),,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0038672025&partnerID=40&md5=08686e36ebe228a5d4ae2f144e92ed87,"Over the last five years, ten species of birds not previously known on the island have been seen, increasing the number of species/subspecies recorded in New Caledonia to about 192 taxa.

However, there is little information on the diversity and abundance of viruses of allochthonous origin, particularly from non-anthropogenic sources, in freshwater and marine ecosystems. We investigated the presence of nucleopolyhedroviruses (NPV) (Baculovirus), which commonly infect terrestrial lepidopteran taxa, across the landscape of Appledore Island, Gulf of Maine.

In Tierra del Fuego, people from interior regions ate more terrestrial fauna, as suggested by ethnohistoric reports, than did people from the coast.

We examined the effects of plot‐, patch‐ and landscape‐scale variables on the patterns of floristic diversity across 34 forest islands that had experienced 26 years of isolation since the creation of the 4437 km 2 Balbina Hydroelectric Reservoir of central Brazilian Amazonia. In addition, three undisturbed continuous forest sites in neighbouring mainland areas were also sampled across a comparable elevational gradient. We identified all live trees ≥10 cm DBH at species level within a total of 87 quarter‐hectare forest plots and conducted a comprehensive compilation of functional attributes of each tree species. We then examined species‐area relationships ( SAR s) and the additional effects of patch and landscape‐scale metrics on patterns of tree assemblage heterogeneity, both in terms of taxonomic and functional diversity. Despite a clearly positive SAR , edge‐mediated forest disturbance was the single most important driver of species composition and abundance within islands. Our results suggest that non‐random floristic transitions within island plots followed a predictable pattern, with different life‐history traits either penalizing or rewarding local persistence of different functional groups. Distance to edges mediated the probability of tree mortality induced by windfalls and episodic surface fires, clearly resulting in faster species turnover and unidirectional changes in guild structure within small islands where light‐wooded fast‐growing pioneers largely replaced heavy‐wooded species of the old‐growth flora.

 The aim of this study was to understand whether the large-scale biogeographical patterns of the species–area, species–island age and species–isolation relationships associated with marine shallow-water groups in the Atlantic Ocean vary among marine taxa and differ from the biogeographical patterns observed in terrestrial habitats.
 
 Location
 Atlantic Ocean.
 
 Methods
 Reef fish, gastropod and seaweed species richness as well as reef fish endemic species data were obtained for 11 Atlantic oceanic islands. Using a multimodel inference approach based on linear and nonlinear regressions, we tested hypotheses regarding the variation in species richness and endemism as a function of island area, age and isolation. Best models were selected using ratios between Akaike weights corrected for small sample size (AICc). Results were compared between the three shallow-water species groups and contrasted against previous studies of marine and terrestrial systems.
 
 Results
 Island area was the best single predictor of gastropod and seaweed richness, although it was not an improvement compared to the null model for reef fish. Island age explained richness in all taxa and was the best single predictor of reef fish richness. Isolation was a good predictor of seaweed richness but not of fish and gastropod richness, possibly because of their overall higher dispersal capacity. Reef fish endemism was influenced solely by island isolation.
 
 Main conclusions
 This work reveals large-scale island biogeographical patterns for marine shallow-water organisms in the Atlantic Ocean. Our results suggest that reduced gene flow is a potentially important mechanism for the maintenance of reef fish endemism in oceanic islands. The role of island age regarding the species richness of all taxa emphasizes the importance of habitat history for the geographical distribution of marine shallow-water biodiversity.

 To evaluate the potential of island systems as tools for investigating how species affect ecosystem properties. This is done by first reviewing the available literature, and then by focusing on a study in an archipelago of lake islands in northern Sweden.
 
 Location
 Islands in lakes Uddjaure and Hornavan in the northern Swedish boreal forest.
 
 Results
 The available literature suggests that islands offer two types of opportunities for investigating how species affect ecosystem properties. The first emerges from the fact that island biotas are often relatively depauperate compared with corresponding continental biotas. This enables the effects of species to be assessed against a less complicated background. The second involves the use of islands as spatially independent replicate ecosystems, which can be used to evaluate the effects of ecosystem drivers over larger spatial scales than is possible through most other approaches that allow proper replication of ecosystems. Examples are presented of the use of each approach. The Swedish lake island system is based on fifty independent islands. A wildfire frequency gradient across these islands favours different plant functional types on different islands; this leads to plant species effects influencing a range of properties both above- and below-ground. Two examples are presented of ecological issues that can be investigated using this island system. First, the difference in fire frequency across islands enables assessment of the effects of fire (and hence fire suppression) on terrestrial carbon storage, and the global change implications of this. Secondly, the system can be used to address theories about the importance of plant community composition and biodiversity in driving ecosystem properties at the across-island spatial scale.
 
 Conclusions
 Islands provide real opportunities for investigating biological drivers of ecosystem functioning, although they have been vastly underused for such purposes. Further, island studies have significant potential for investigating the effects of global change phenomena on terrestrial ecosystems, ranging from the impacts of biodiversity loss and invasive organisms to issues relating to terrestrial carbon sequestration.

 Location Oklahoma Panhandle, USA.
 
 Methods We surveyed mammal, reptile and amphibian communities on 36 black-tailed prairie dog (Cynomys ludovicianus) towns during the summers and falls of 1997 to 1999. We used a Geographic Information System (GIS) to characterize the landscape within 10 km of each town. We used Principal Components Analysis (PCA), Correlation Analysis, and Linear Regression to test for patterns in species richness relative to area and isolation of towns, local habitat characteristics, and characteristics of the adjacent landscape.
 
 Results Species richness was not significantly correlated with town size, town isolation, or local habitat characteristics. On the other hand, species richness was significantly correlated with characteristics of the landscape within 10 km of the focal town. In addition, species richness of mammals at prairie dog towns during the summer increased in a northerly direction, while richness of mammals at towns during fall increased to the west.
 
 Main conclusions These results, albeit contrary to traditional island biogeography theory, are consistent with an emerging view that communities on relatively small islands are strongly influenced by characteristics of the adjacent landscape (or seascape).

Location. Oklahoma Panhandle, USA. Methods. We surveyed mammal, reptile and amphibian communities on 36 black-tailed prairie dog (Cynomys ludovicianus) towns during the summers and falls of 1997 to 1999. We used a Geographic Information System (GIS) to characterize the landscape within 10 km of each town. We used Principal Components Analysis (PCA), Correlation Analysis, and Linear Regression to test for patterns in species richness relative to area and isolation of towns, local habitat characteristics, and characteristics of the adjacent landscape. Results. Species richness was not significantly correlated with town size, town isolation, or local habitat characteristics. On the other hand, species richness was significantly correlated with characteristics of the landscape within 10 km of the focal town. In addition, species richness of mammals at prairie dog towns during the summer increased in a northerly direction, while richness of mammals at towns during fall increased to the west. Main conclusion. These results, albeit contrary to traditional island biogeography theory, are consistent with an emerging view that communities on relatively small islands are strongly influenced by characteristics of the adjacent landscape (or seascape). We recommended that to the extent possible, networks of reserves for prairie dogs and their associated species should include clusters of large towns (i.e. larger than those studied here), as well as large but isolated towns, and that conservation efforts should include management of the intervening matrix of anthropogenic habitats.",2003,2025-04-16 10:10:35,2025-04-16 10:10:35,,275-286,,4,12,,Global Ecol.

Cribra orbitalia, a form of porotic hyperostosis associated with iron deficiency anemia, is just as common among these fisherpeople, whose diet was rich in iron and essential amino acids, as it is among maize-dependent agriculturalists.

Four large cages were placed over other, similar, islands to determine the persistence of populations trapped inside the cages in the absence of immigration. In addition, six traps located in the study area showed the general movement patterns of arthropods. A distinction was made between transient and resident species colonizing the islands based partly upon 3 previous yr of data on the arthropod communities of the area.

106,Butterfly diversity and a preliminary comparison with bird and mammal diversity,"Robbins, Robert; Opler, Paul",1997,,,,"Butterflies are among the best-known insects•an estimated 90% of the world's species have scientific names. As a consequence, their biology has been extensively investigated (Vane-Wright and Ackery, 1984), and they are perhaps the best group of insects for examining patterns of terrestrial biotic diversity and distribution. Butterflies also have a favorable image with the general public. Hence, they are an excellent group for communicating information on science and conservation issues such as diversity. Perhaps the aspect of butterfly diversity that has received the most attention over the last century is the striking difference in species richness between tropical and temperate regions. For example, Bates (1875) wrote that it would convey some idea of the diversity of butterflies (in the neighborhood of Belem, a town near the mouth of the Amazon River) when he mentioned that about 700 species are found within a hour's walk of the town, whereas the total number found in the British Islands does not exceed 66, and the whole of Europe supports only 321. This early comparison of tropical and temperate butterfly richness has been well confirmed (e.g., Owen, 1971; Scriber, 1973). A general theory of diversity would have to predict not only this difference between temperate and tropical zones, but also patterns within each region, and how these patterns vary among different animal and plant groups. However, for butterflies, variation of species richness within temperate or tropical regions, rather than between them, is poorly understood. Indeed, comparisons of numbers ofspecies among the Amazon basin, tropical Asia, and Africa are still mostly ""personal communication"" citations, even for vertebrates (Gentry, 1988a). In other words, unlike comparisons between temperate and tropical areas, these patterns are still in the documentation phase. In documenting geographical variation in butterfly diversity, we make some arbitrary, but practical decisions. Diversity, number of species, and species richness are used synonymously; we know little about the evenness of butterfly relative abundances. The New World fauna makes up the preponderance of examples because we are most familiar with these species. By focusing on them, we hope to minimize the errors generated by imperfect and incomplete taxonomy. Although what is and is not a butterfly is technically controversial.
 The first three sections of this chapter summarize general patterns of butterfly diversity throughout the world, within the conterminous United States, and in the Neotropics, respectively. The fourth section points out, albeit preliminarily, how the distributions of butterflies•and presumably other insects• paint a different biogeographical picture of the world than the distributions of birds and mammals.

Spatial subsidies, defined as the flow of energy, nutrients, organisms or pollutants from one habitat to another, have been shown to affect the food–web dynamics in a wide range of ecosystems. An important subsidy to riparian communities is the contribution of adult stream insects to terrestrial predators such as birds, bats and lizards, but also invertebrates including ground and web-building spiders.
 
 2. We surveyed 37 first- and second-order forest streams across differing environmental gradients in the Central South Island, New Zealand, to investigate the relationship between potential aquatic prey subsidies and predatory riparian arachnids. We anticipated that stream-insect biomass would be positively associated with riparian arachnids, as a result of emergent adult aquatic insect subsidies to the adjacent habitat.
 
 3. We confirmed positive associations between stream-insect biomass as a predictor variable and riparian arachnid biomass (R2 = 0.42, F1,34 = 25.2, P < 0.001) and web densities (R2 = 0.45, F1,14 = 11.5, P < 0.01) respectively as dependent variables after adjusting for the confounding effects of environmental variables. Hierarchical partitioning confirmed the importance of stream insect biomass as a statistically significant contributor to the total explained variance in analyses calculated for arachnid biomass, abundance and web density.
 
 4. A concurrent survey of spider-web density along 20-m transects from the stream edge into the forest indicated a strong decline in web-building spider density moving away from the stream (R2 = 0.41, F1,158 = 109, P < 0.001), with stream-insect biomass as a significant covariate (F1,149 = 17.7, P < 0.001).
 
 5. Our results suggest that productivity gradients present in the donor system affect the magnitude of the interaction between adjacent habitats. Productivity gradients may lead to increased reciprocal subsidies through a positive feedback loop involving the predation of spiders and other predatory terrestrial invertebrates by aquatic predators. However, terrestrial insectivores such as birds, bats and lizards that are not readily used as prey by aquatic predators may circumvent the feedback cycle by consuming a large proportion of emergent aquatic-insect biomass.

Abundance estimation is a pervasive goal in ecology. The rate of detection by motion-sensitive camera traps can, in principle, provide information on the abundance of many species of terrestrial vertebrates that are otherwise difficult to survey. The random encounter model (REM, Rowcliffe et al. 2008) provides a means estimating abundance from camera trap rate but requires camera sensitivity to be quantified.
 
 2. Here, we develop a method to estimate the area effectively monitored by cameras, which is one of the most important codeterminants of detection rate. Our method borrows from distance sampling theory, applying detection function models to data on the position (distance and angle relative to the camera) where the animals are first detected. Testing the reliability of this approach through simulation, we find that bias depends on the effective detection angle assumed but was generally low at less than 5% for realistic angles typical of camera traps.
 
 3. We adapted standard detection functions to allow for the possibility of smaller animals passing beneath the field of view close to the camera, resulting in reduced detection probability within that zone. Using a further simulation to test this approach, we find that detection distance can be estimated with little or no bias if detection probability is certain for at least some distance from the camera.
 
 4. Applying this method to a 1-year camera trapping data set from Barro Colorado Island, Panama, we show that effective detection distance is related strongly positively to species body mass and weakly negatively to species average speed of movement. There was also a strong seasonal effect, with shorter detection distance during the wet season. Effective detection angle is related more weakly to species body mass, and again strongly to season, with a wider angle in the wet season.

Eight of 12 bird species in the terrestrial insectivore guild, with historical breeding records from BCI, are now extinct on the island. I tested the hypothesis that interspecific variation in nest design and placement underlies differential avian extinction from BCI. Selecting five species from the terrestrial insectivore guild, two that are extinct and three that persist on BCI, I constructed 200 hand—made mimics of their nests (40 each of five types) using species—specific nest materials collected in local forest. Artificial nests, containing Coturnix quail eggs as bait, were placed on two island and two mainland plots for representative incubation periods (15 d) and checked at 3—d intervals for predation. Experiments were repeated in February, late April, and June of 1988 to assess seasonal shifts in predation pressure in relation to timing of breeding in understory birds, and temporal constancy of interspecific differences in nest lost rates. BCI nest losses were higher than on the mainland in two of the three experiments and predation intensity varied seasonally. Peak losses occurred in April—May (late in the dry season), immediately before the onset of breeding in understory insectivorous birds, suggesting nest predation may influence the timing of nesting activities. Two nest types designed to mimic the nests of species now extinct from BCI suffered lower predation on BCI and on the mainland than three nest types of species persisting on BCI. However, ratios of island to mainland predation rates were disproportionately higher for BCI—extinct nest types than for BCI—persistent nests in two of the three samples. Results suggest that over evolutionary time species—specific rates of nest loss may determine clutch replacement capability, thereby causing variation in tolerance of inflated insular nest predation. In this way, interspecific variation in nest design and placement among terrestrial insectivorous birds may underlie the pattern of differential extinction from Barro Colorado Island.",Island (Population);,,,negative,10.2307/1941477,7892,268,7893,5RTUHD4G,journalArticle,1992,"Sieving, K.E.",Nest predation and differential insular extinction among selected forest birds of central Panama,Ecology,,00129658 (ISSN),10.2307/1941477,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0027060143&doi=10.2307%2f1941477&partnerID=40&md5=8ffee5504db972701278bc05a4b4f857,"Barro Colorado Island (BCI) is a 75-yr-old tropical forest isolate where depredation of understory bird nests is hypothesized to be more intense than in nearby mainland forest.

Success in Nolana may be attributed to characters that confer a competitive advantage in unpredictable and water-dependent environments, such as succulent leaf anatomy and ecophysiology, and the reproductive mericarp unique to Nolana. The processes affecting or shaping the biota of western South America are discussed. © 2009 Institute of Botany, Chinese Academy of Sciences.",2009,2025-04-16 10:12:46,2025-04-16 10:12:46,,457-476,,5,47,,J.

Empirical support of this idea is weak in terrestrial systems, though tests of fragmentation effects are typically confounded with landscape composition and potentially obscured by imperfect detection. Here, we used multispecies occupancy models and a mensurative experimental design to test competing hypotheses about how forest fragmentation influences distributions of breeding forest bird species and communities. Location Southern Indiana, USA. Methods During the breeding seasons of 2011–2013, we recorded over 80,000 bird detections in 202 forest fragments using a sampling design that isolated the effects of patch size per se from the effects of forest amount within a 2 km radius, edge distance, local vegetation and sampling area. We modelled the effects of these covariates on distributions of individual species categorized by ecological trait groups (i.e., forest, forest interior or forest edge), and evaluated how forest loss and fragmentation impact species richness. Results Though our results indicated little effect of patch size on total species richness, decreasing patch size had a negative effect on interior species, and a positive effect on edge species. The effects of total forest amount were much more variable, and surprisingly had a negative influence on many species, particularly cavity nesters. Main conclusions Our results do not support theoretical predictions that forest patch size should positively influence bird species richness.

Arboreal and terrestrial ants differed markedly in their preferences for protein- or carbohydrate-based baits; arboreal ants preferred protein-based baits and terrestrial ants preferred carbohydrate-based baits. Foraging preference for protein suggests that protein resources were limiting for arboreal ants, particularly during the dry season, and that carbohydrate resources were limiting for terrestrial ants. Fundamental differences in arboreal and terrestrial habitats may promote the differences in foraging strategies observed during an annual cycle in a seasonal tropical forest.",2002,2025-04-16 10:10:22,2025-04-16 10:10:22,,348-356,,3,34,,Biotropica,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Publisher: Association for Tropical Biology Inc.,,,,El Niño; food preference; Seasonality; Hymenoptera; ant; seasonality; Formicidae; Panama; foraging behavior; Foraging; Ants; Barro Colorado Island; utritive value; bait; Bait preferences; canopy; Forest canopy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.0041,0.001-0.012,0.004,100.00%

Plant functional traits determine vegetation responses to environmental variation, but variation in trait values is large, even within a single site. Likewise, uncertainty in how these traits map to Earth system feedbacks is large. We use a vegetation demographic model (VDM), the Functionally Assembled Terrestrial Ecosystem Simulator (FATES), to explore parameter sensitivity of model predictions, and comparison to observations, at a tropical forest site: Barro Colorado Island in Panama. We define a single 12-dimensional distribution of plant trait variation, derived primarily from observations in Panama, and define plant functional types (PFTs) as random draws from this distribution. We compare several model ensembles, where individual ensemble members vary only in the plant traits that define PFTs, and separate ensembles differ from each other based on either model structural assumptions or non-trait, ecosystem-level parameters, which include (a) the number of competing PFTs present in any simulation and (b) parameters that govern disturbance and height-based light competition. While single-PFT simulations are roughly consistent with observations of productivity at Barro Colorado Island, increasing the number of competing PFTs strongly shifts model predictions towards higher productivity and biomass forests. Different ecosystem variables show greater sensitivity than others to the number of competing PFTs, with the predictions that are most dominated by large trees, such as biomass, being the most sensitive. Changing disturbance and height-sorting parameters, i.e., the rules of competitive trait filtering, shifts regimes of dominance or coexistence between early- and late-successional PFTs in the model. Increases to the extent or severity of disturbance, or to the degree of determinism in height-based light competition, all act to shift the community towards early-successional PFTs. In turn, these shifts in competitive outcomes alter predictions of ecosystem states and fluxes, with more early-successional-dominated forests having lower biomass. It is thus crucial to differentiate between plant traits, which are under competitive pressure in VDMs, from those model parameters that are not and to better understand the relationships between these two types of model parameters to quantify sources of uncertainty in VDMs.",Island (Population);,,,negative,10.5194/bg-17-3017-2020,14576,9277,14577,6IVCLHDG,journalArticle,2020,"Koven, C.D.; Knox, R.G.; Fisher, R.A.; Chambers, J.Q.; Chambers, J.Q.; Christoffersen, B.O.; Davies, S.J.; Detto, M.; Detto, M.; Dietze, M.C.; Faybishenko, B.; Holm, J.; Huang, M.; Kovenock, M.; Kueppers, L.M.; Lemieux, G.; Massoud, E.; McDowell, N.G.; Muller-Landau, H.C.; Needham, J.F.; Norby, R.J.; Powell, T.; Rogers, A.; Serbin, S.P.; Shuman, J.K.; Swann, A.L.S.; Varadharajan, C.; Walker, A.P.; Joseph Wright, S.; Xu, C.","Benchmarking and parameter sensitivity of physiological and vegetation dynamics using the Functionally Assembled Terrestrial Ecosystem Simulator (FATES) at Barro Colorado Island, Panama",Biogeosciences,,17264170 (ISSN),10.5194/bg-17-3017-2020,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85087217589&doi=10.5194%2fbg-17-3017-2020&partnerID=40&md5=73fe9218a91a4339bf4e5552311cf6e1,"Plant functional traits determine vegetation responses to environmental variation, but variation in trait values is large, even within a single site.

We tested the Walker and Syers model in semiarid piñon–juniper woodlands by measuring soil P fractions under tree canopies and in intercanopy spaces along a well‐constrained, ∼3000 ka (1 ka = 1000 years) volcanic substrate age gradient in northern Arizona, USA. The various pools of soil P behaved largely as predicted; total soil P and primary mineral P declined consistently with substrate age, labile inorganic P increased early in soil development and then declined at later stages, and organic phosphorus increased consistently across the chronosequence. Within each site, soils under tree canopies tended to have higher concentrations of labile and intermediately available P fractions compared to intercanopy soils. However, the degree of spatial heterogeneity conferred by tree islands was moderated by the stage of soil development. In contrast, tree islands had no influence on within‐site distribution of more recalcitrant soil P pools, which appear to be controlled solely by the stage of pedogenesis. Coincident with declines in total P, primary mineral P, and labile inorganic P, we found that phosphatase enzyme activity increased with substrate age; a result consistent with greater ecosystem‐level P demand on older, more highly weathered substrates.

In total, 334 species from 117 genera were identified in both polar regions, i.e. 210 spp. (98 genera) in the Arctic, 120 spp. (73 genera) in the maritime and 59 spp. (41 genera) in the continental Antarctic. Forty-four species (13% of all species) were common to both Arctic and Antarctic freshwater bodies and 19 spp. to both Antarctic areas (12% of all species). Many taxa are cosmopolitans but some, e.g. Stentor and Metopus spp., are not, and over 20% of the taxa found in any one of the three areas are new to science.

Marine data also show large numbers of rare species, even if the extent of the study is greatly increased from a few square metres to hundreds of square kilometres. Fitting log‐normal distributions to data on species abundance distributions (SADs) for marine benthic assemblages from the continental shelf of Norway, and for the well‐studied tropical tree data of Barro Colorado Island, Panama (BCI), show patterns suggesting that more than one log‐normal distribution occurs. We have developed a simple model of SADs comprising two groups of log‐normally distributed species, a group of rare species and a group of common species. The model appears to fit the marine data and also applies to the BCI tropical tree data and yet is simpler than Hubbell's Zero‐Sum Multinomial (ZSM) distribution model. The plots of the model results show that the marine data are dominated by the rare group of species at all scales studied. In the tropical tree assemblage a similar pattern to that in the marine data is apparent only at small spatial scales (5 and 10 ha), but not at the larger extent (25–50 ha). It is important to note, however, that marine data at all the scales studied are samples from a given area, whereas the terrestrial data are exact counts of all species of tree within the total 50 ha plot studied. Most ecological data are likely to be based on samples rather than exact counts so the patterns found with the marine data are likely to be common, and our findings general ones. A biological explanation for the two‐group log‐normal model is that recruitment of rare species from outside the studied area dominates benthic assemblages of soft sediments at all sampled scales. Within the tropical forest the dominance of recruitment processes are only apparent at small scales.

197,"An evaluation of peat loss from an Everglades tree island, Florida, USA.","Aich, Sumanjit; Ewe, Sharon; Gu, Ben; Dreschel, Thomas",2014,Mires and Peat,,,"The tree islands of the Everglades are considered to be biodiversity “hotspots”, where the majority of terrestrial species of the Everglades are found. Drainage for agricultural and urban development in the early 1900s has had a severe impact, converting many of them into “ghost tree islands” which have lost most of their woody vegetation and much of their altitude (elevation). A survey conducted in 1973 on one of the prominent ghost tree islands, named “Dineen Island”, provides insights into the past. We compared the results of the 1973 survey with those of a survey conducted in 2009, in order to examine changes in Dineen Island that had taken place over 36 years and to provide information about general trends in the Everglades. Peat loss at Dineen Island was roughly 4 mm yr- 1. This subsidence, as a consequence of peat loss, has been accompanied by losses in nitrogen and phosphorus of 234 and 2.5 metric tons (4.5 and 0.05 metric tons per hectare), respectively. As many of the Everglades tree islands have been lost from the landscape due to historical water management practices, quantifying nutrient losses from this ecosystem may be useful in helping to predict non-anthropogenic nutrient biogeochemistry shifts in Everglades oligotrophy.",Island (Population);,,,negative,nan,0,1360,1,GAY9UFPD,journalArticle,2003,"Barré, N.; Bachy, P.",Complement to the list of the birds of New Caledonia,Alauda,,00024619 (ISSN),,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0038672025&partnerID=40&md5=08686e36ebe228a5d4ae2f144e92ed87,"Over the last five years, ten species of birds not previously known on the island have been seen, increasing the number of species/subspecies recorded in New Caledonia to about 192 taxa.

Ponds surrounded by terrestrial landscape are an example of patchy distribution of physical conditions and constitute ""islands"" for odonates. Few studies have focussed on dispersal in odonates. We have used the direct method of dispersal observing (capture-mark-recapture technique) in order to estimate the degree of linkage in three patchy populations of odonate localised on three ponds. We also examined the differences in dispersal ability within and among three species (Coenagrion puella, Coenagrion scitulum and Libellula depressa). The ponds were situated in southwest France on a limestone plateau. In this arid area, these ponds constitute the only surface water available and are relatively sparsely distributed. The size of the ponds ranged from 48 to 79 m2 and they were 200 and 775 m apart. We demonstrated that three factors influence the dispersal ability of these odonates. The first is represented by the abiotic factors and especially weather conditions. This determines the number of days that dispersal is possible. The second is interspecific differences. We showed that sensitivity to weather conditions, species size and species behaviour influence dispersal ability. The third factor is the intraspecific characteristics. We demonstrated that there are differences in dispersal ability according to sex and age.

We have used the direct method of dispersal observing (capture-mark-recapture technique) in order to estimate the degree of linkage in three patchy populations of odonate localised on three ponds. We also examined the differences in dispersal ability within and among three species (Coenagrion puella, Coenagrion scitulum and Libellula depressa). The ponds were situated in southwest France on a limestone plateau. In this arid area, these ponds constitute the only surface water available and are relatively sparsely distributed. The size of the ponds ranged from 48 to 79 m2 and they were 200 and 775 m apart. We demonstrated that three factors influence the dispersal ability of these odonates. The first is represented by the abiotic factors and especially weather conditions. This determines the number of days that dispersal is possible. The second is interspecific differences. We showed that sensitivity to weather conditions, species size and species behaviour influence dispersal ability. The third factor is the intraspecific characteristics. We demonstrated that there are differences in dispersal ability according to sex and age.

This study provides improved methanol emission estimates on the global scale, in particular for the largest methanol source, the terrestrial biosphere, and for biomass burning. To this purpose, one complete year of spaceborne measurements of tropospheric methanol columns retrieved for the first time by the thermal infrared sensor IASI aboard the MetOp satellite are compared with distributions calculated by the IMAGESv2 global chemistry-transport model. Two model simulations are performed using a priori biogenic methanol emissions either from the new MEGANv2.1 emission model, which is fully described in this work and is based on net ecosystem flux measurements, or from a previous parameterization based on net primary production by Jacob et al. (2005). A significantly better model performance in terms of both amplitude and seasonality is achieved through the use of MEGANv2.1 in most world regions, with respect to IASI data, and to surface- and air-based methanol measurements, even though important discrepancies over several regions are still present. As a second step of this study, we combine the MEGANv2.1 and the IASI column abundances over continents in an inverse modelling scheme based on the adjoint of the IMAGESv2 model to generate an improved global methanol emission source. The global optimized source totals 187 Tg yr−1 with a contribution of 100 Tg yr−1 from plants, only slightly lower than the a priori MEGANv2.1 value of 105 Tg yr−1. Large decreases with respect to the MEGANv2.1 biogenic source are inferred over Amazonia (up to 55 %) and Indonesia (up to 58 %), whereas more moderate reductions are recorded in the Eastern US (20–25 %) and Central Africa (25–35 %). On the other hand, the biogenic source is found to strongly increase in the arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia (up to a factor of 5) and Western US (factor of 2), probably due to a source of methanol specific to these ecosystems which is unaccounted for in the MEGANv2.1 inventory. The most significant error reductions achieved by the optimization concern the derived biogenic emissions over the Amazon and over the Former Soviet Union.

Five lagoonal zones based on population densities around the coast of Tahiti were identified, and within each zone a transect from the fringing reef to the barrier reef was sampled, a total of 18 stations. Only large macrofauna collected on a 2 mm sieve were considered in this study. Multivariate analysis using total biomass and environmental factors showed that the stations formed 3 main groups which were related to sediment characteristics, including percentage of silt, organic matter and phaeopigment levels. The distribution of the major feeding groups was related to the amounts of terrestrial inputs and distance from the shore. The stations on the barrier reef and those in zones adjacent to low population areas were not impacted by these terrestrial inputs. Deposit-feeding communities of capitellid polychaetes were dominant in the channel parts of the lagoon, which acted as decanting ponds. Chaetopterid polychaetes played an important role in recycling sediments of terrigenous origin in the fringing ecosystem. The patterns of diversity, density and biomass of the benthos around the lagoon revealed that some areas were impacted by moderate terrigenous inputs. It appears that the intermediate disturbance hypothesis explains the functioning of the parts of the benthic lagoonal ecosystem which are subjected to human impact. The organic enrichment by terrestrial inputs contrasts with food limitation that appears to occur in the non-disturbed areas. Despite high organic loads, the benthic communities present at the harbour station were not depauperate, as bioturbation by burrowing alpheids and callianassids prevented anoxic conditions from developing.

Five lagoonal zones based on population densities around the coast of Tahiti were identified, and within each zone a transect from the fringing reef to the barrier reef was sampled, a total of 18 stations. Only large macrofauna collected on a 2 mm sieve were considered in this study. Multivariate analysis using total biomass and environmental factors showed that the stations formed 3 main groups which were related to sediment characteristics, including percentage of silt, organic matter and phaeopigment levels. The distribution of the major feeding groups was related to the amounts of terrestrial inputs and distance from the shore. The stations on the barrier reef and those in zones adjacent to low population areas were not impacted by these terrestrial inputs. Deposit-feeding communities of capitellid polychaetes were dominant in the channel parts of the lagoon, which acted as decanting ponds. Chaetopterid polychaetes played an important role in recycling sediments of terrigenous origin in the fringing ecosystem. The patterns of diversity, density and biomass of the benthos around the lagoon revealed that some areas were impacted by moderate terrigenous inputs. It appears that the intermediate disturbance hypothesis explains the functioning of the parts of the benthic lagoonal ecosystem which are subjected to human impact. The organic enrichment by terrestrial inputs contrasts with food limitation that appears to occur in the non-disturbed areas. Despite high organic loads, the benthic communities present at the harbour station were not depauperate, as bioturbation by burrowing alpheids and callianassids prevented anoxic conditions from developing.",2000,2025-04-16 10:10:11,2025-04-16 10:10:11,,39-53,,,194,,Mar.

A substantial fraction of the freshwater available in neotropical forests is impounded within the rosettes of bromeliads that form aquatic islands in a terrestrial matrix. The ecosystem functioning of bromeliads is known to be influenced by the composition of the contained community but it is not clear whether bromeliad food webs remain functionally similar against a background of variation in the understorey environment. 2. We considered a broad range of environmental conditions, including incident light and incoming litter, and quantified the distribution of a very wide range of freshwater organisms (from viruses to macroinvertebrates) to determine the factors that influence the functional structure of bromeliad food webs in samples taken from 171 tank‐bromeliads. 3.

Algae, rotifers and collector and predatory invertebrates dominated bromeliad food webs in exposed areas, whereas filter‐feeding insects had their highest densities in shaded forest areas.

Despite this, diatom assemblages from lake sediment cores are often difficult to interpret due to a limited knowledge of the ecology of some species, some of which may originate from the adjacent limno-terrestrial landscape. Here, we compare diatom assemblages from two recently published Antarctic lake sediment cores collected from the northeast and southwest sides of Vega Island, Antarctic Peninsula. We further compare the sediment core assemblages with adjacent modern communities inhabiting four different limno-terrestrial habitat types to gauge the importance of landscape connectivity in determining paleo-assemblage structure. We found that diatom assemblage composition was significantly different between the two cores, and our survey of modern habitats further revealed habitat type to be an important factor determining the composition of limno-terrestrial samples. Differences in modern habitats were driven primarily by Chamaepinnularia krookiformis in mosses, Nitzschia paleacea in ponds, and Fistulifera pelliculosa in streams. When modern communities were compared with paleo-assemblages through ordination, the cored lake from the northeast side, which exhibited greater hydrological connectivity with its surroundings, clustered more closely with the adjacent modern samples. Meanwhile, the cored lake from the southwest side, which was more hydrologically isolated, formed a distinct cluster separate from the others. Overall, species richness and diversity were greater on the southwest side of the island than the northeast, and the known distributions of diatom taxa supported the notion that Vega Island was a transitional zone between the Maritime and Continental Antarctic bioregions. These results collectively suggested that while environmental and spatial controls may be influential in determining diatom community composition, the unique hydrogeological setting of individual waterbodies was an important consideration for determining the assemblage structure of lake cores.

Most previous studies of northern lake biodiversity responses to environmental changes have focused on only a single organismal group. Investigations at whole‐lake scales that integrate different habitats and trophic levels are currently rare, but highly necessary for future lake monitoring and management. We analysed spatial biodiversity patterns of 74 sub‐Arctic lakes in Norway, Sweden, Finland, and the Faroe Islands with monitoring data for at least three biological focal ecosystem components (FECs)—benthic diatoms, macrophytes, phytoplankton, littoral benthic macroinvertebrates, zooplankton, and fish—that covered both pelagic and benthic habitats and multiple trophic levels. We calculated the richness relative (i.e. taxon richness of a FEC in the lake divided by the total richness of that FEC in all 74 lakes) and the biodiversity metrics (i.e. taxon richness, inverse Simpson index (diversity), and taxon evenness) of individual FECs using presence–absence and abundance data, respectively. We then investigated whether the FEC richness relative and biodiversity metrics were correlated with lake abiotic and geospatial variables. We hypothesised that (1) individual FECs would be more diverse in a warmer and wetter climate (e.g. at lower latitudes and/or elevations), and in hydrobasins with greater forest cover that could enhance the supply of terrestrial organic matter and nutrients that stimulated lake productivity; and (2) patterns in FEC responses would be coupled among trophic levels. Results from redundancy analyses showed that the richness relative of phytoplankton, macrophytes, and fish decreased, but those of the intermediate trophic levels (i.e. macroinvertebrates and zooplankton) increased with decreasing latitude and/or elevation. Fish richness relative and diversity increased with increasing temporal variation in climate (temperature and/or precipitation), ambient nutrient concentrations (e.g. total nitrogen) in lakes, and woody vegetation (e.g. taiga forest) cover in hydrobasins, whereas taxon richness of macroinvertebrates and zooplankton decreased with increasing temporal variation in climate. The similar patterns detected for richness relative of fish, macrophytes, and phytoplankton could be caused by similar responses to the environmental descriptors, and/or the beneficial effects of macrophytes as habitat structure. By creating habitat, macrophytes may increase fish diversity and production, which in turn may promote higher densities and probably more diverse assemblages of phytoplankton through trophic cascades. Lakes with greater fish richness relative tended to have greater average richness relative among FECs, suggesting that fish are a potential indicator for overall lake biodiversity. Overall, the biodiversity patterns observed along the environmental gradients were trophic‐level specific, indicating that an integrated food‐web perspective may lead to a more holistic understanding of ecosystem biodiversity in future monitoring and management of high‐latitude lakes. In future, monitoring should also focus on collecting more abundance data for fish and lower trophic levels in both benthic and pelagic habitats.

In Australia, predation by introduced feral cats has been implicated in the extinction of many mammal species, and in the ongoing decline of many extant species.
 
 Here, we collate a wide range of records of predation by cats (including feral and pet cats) on Australian mammals and model traits of extant, terrestrial, native mammal species associated with the relative likelihood of cat predation. We explicitly seek to overcome biases in such a continental-scale compilation by excluding possible carrion records for larger species and accounting for differences in the distribution and abundance of potential prey species, as well as study effort, throughout each species’ range.
 
 For non-volant species, the relative likelihood of predation by cats was greatest for species in an intermediate weight range (peaking at ca. 400 g), in lower rainfall areas and not dwelling in rocky habitats. Previous studies have shown the greatest rates of decline and extinction in Australian mammals to be associated with these traits. As such, we provide the first continental-scale link between mammal decline and cat predation through quantitative analysis.
 
 Our compilation of cat predation records for most extant, terrestrial, native mammal species (151 species, or 52% of the Australian species’ complement) is substantially greater than previously reported (88 species) and includes 50 species listed as threatened by the IUCN or under Australian legislation (57% of Australia's 87 threatened terrestrial mammal species).

We tested this concept by flying a drone-mounted thermal infrared radiometric sensor over the wildlife-rich rainforests of Barro Colorado Island, Panama. Arboreal mammals had body temperatures around 27°C and were conspicuous in the thermal infrared imagery at night and early morning when the forest canopy was cool (23–25°C), but were difficult to detect by mid-morning, by which time the direct sunshine had heated up canopy vegetation to over 30°C.

Manu Park is occupied by &gt;460 settled Matsigenka Amerindians, 300–400 isolated Matsigenka, and several, little‐known groups of isolated hunter–gatherers, yet the impact of these native Amazonians on game vertebrate populations within the park remains poorly understood. On the basis of 1495 km of standardized line‐transect censuses, we present density and biomass estimates for 23 mammal, bird, and reptile species for seven lowland and upland forest sites in Manu Park, including Cocha Cashu. We compare these estimates between hunted and nonhunted sites within Manu Park, and with other Neotropical forest sites. Manu Park safeguards some of the most species‐rich and highest biomass assemblages of arboreal and terrestrial mammals ever recorded in Neotropical forests, most likely because of its direct Andean influence and high levels of soil fertility. Relative to Barro Colorado Island, seed predators and arboreal folivores in Manu are rare, and generalist frugivores specializing on mature fruit pulp are abundant. The impact of such a qualitative shift in the vertebrate community on the dynamics of plant regeneration, and therefore, on our understanding of tropical plant ecology, must be profound.

272,"Vegetation and vascular flora of the Mekong River, Kratie and Steung Treng Provinces, Cambodia","Maxwell, James",2009,DOAJ (DOAJ: Directory of Open Access Journals),,,"A preliminary and detailed botanical survey of the islands in the Mekong River between Kratie and Steung Treng was done. This area includes the most biologically intact and threatened riparian and terrestrial ecosystems along the river in Cambodia. The vegetation includes six riverine zones and four terrestrial facies. Riverine habitats are mostly intact while the terrestrial vegetation ranges from destroyed to degraded. Effective conservation measures are required to stop further habitat destruction and loss of biodiversity. One new species, 23 records for the Cambodian flora, and a total of 690 species were collected. Detailed descriptions of all habitats, a database, and photographs are included. Increased exploitative human settlement in the area has caused drastic environmental changes with extensive deforestation and hunting. The forests are grazed, burned, logged, and often cleared for agricultural use without effective control. Sustainable management and scientifically acceptable development must be implemented before the area is totally ruined. Properly conceived reforestation is urgently required as well as a conservation education project aimed directly at the people living in the area. Unless effective restraints are implemented the area will become biologically destitute and will not be able to provide the natural resources that people require--in short, the area will become uninhabitable. Restoration of degraded or destroyed places will be impossible or far more difficult than conservation and intelligent management of presently endangered places. The potential for profitable eco-tourism should also be considered since tourists will certainly want to visit natural ecosystems on some of the islands. Only if local people are directly involved in eco-tourism and understand the necessity of conservation can this activity be successful.

275,Implications of biogeography in the use of butterflyfishes (Chaetodontidae) as indicators for Western and Central Pacific areas,"Kulbicki, Michel; Bozec, Yves‐Marie; Green, Abigail",2005,Aquatic Conservation Marine and Freshwater Ecosystems,https://doi.org/10.1002/aqc.693,10.1002/aqc.693,"1.
 The biogeography in the Western and Central Pacific of butterflyfishes (Chaetodontidae) is analysed with respect to their diversity, diet, size and behaviour. This analysis, based on data from 48 islands, is used to discuss some of the assumptions underlying the use of these fishes as indicators of reef ecological condition and in reef fish monitoring programmes.
 
 2.
 The diversity of butterflyfishes is highly correlated to total diversity, and the relative importance of butterflyfishes for total diversity decreases as total diversity increases.
 
 3.
 Factors found significant in explaining butterflyfish diversity were distance to the biodiversity centre, island size and connectivity, the variance explained by these factors being at least 81%. Latitude, terrestrial influence and reef development were not significant.
 
 4.
 Feeding categories of butterflyfishes are not randomly distributed over their range: coral feeders and other sessile invertebrate feeders are more diverse than expected. The relative diversity of algae-feeding species and generalist feeders decreases with butterflyfish diversity. Small and medium size fishes are less diverse than expected, large fishes are more diverse than expected.
 
 5.
 Local species composition of butterflyfish may not reflect species composition at a larger scale, in particular biological and ecological traits are not necessarily distributed similarly at different spatial scales.

 including invasive species, infectious diseases, climate and land-use change. Motion sensitive camera traps offer a visual
 sensor to record the presence of a broad range of species providing location – specific information on movement and
 behavior. Modern digital camera traps that record video present not only new analytical opportunities, but also new data
 management challenges. This paper describes our experience with a terrestrial animal monitoring system at Barro Colorado
 Island, Panama. Our camera network captured the spatio-temporal dynamics of terrestrial bird and mammal activity at the
 site - data relevant to immediate science questions, and long-term conservation issues. We believe that the experience gained
 and lessons learned during our year-long deployment and testing of the camera traps as well as the developed solutions are
 applicable to broader sensor network applications and are valuable for the advancement of the sensor network research. We
 suggest that the continued development of these hardware, software, and analytical tools, in concert, offer an exciting sensornetwork solution to monitoring of animal populations which could realistically scale over larger areas and time spans.",Island (Population);,,,negative,nan,0,1360,1,GAY9UFPD,journalArticle,2003,"Barré, N.; Bachy, P.",Complement to the list of the birds of New Caledonia,Alauda,,00024619 (ISSN),,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0038672025&partnerID=40&md5=08686e36ebe228a5d4ae2f144e92ed87,"Over the last five years, ten species of birds not previously known on the island have been seen, increasing the number of species/subspecies recorded in New Caledonia to about 192 taxa.

These metrics are usually derived from telemetry or direct observations. Here, we describe and validate an entirely new alternative approach, using camera traps recording passing animals to measure movement paths at very fine scale. Dividing the length of a passage by its duration gives a speed observation, and average travel speed is estimated by fitting size‐biased probability distributions to a sample of speed observations. Day range is then estimated as the product of travel speed and activity level (proportion of time spent active), which can also be estimated from camera‐trap data. We field tested the procedure with data from a survey of terrestrial mammals on Barro Colorado Island, Panama. Travel speeds and day ranges estimated for 12 species scaled positively with body mass, and were higher in faunivores than in herbivores, patterns that are consistent with those obtained using independent estimates derived from tracked individuals. Comparisons of our day range estimates with independent telemetry‐based estimates for three species also showed very similar values in absolute terms. We conclude that these methods are accurate and ready to use for estimating travel speed and day range in wildlife. Key advantages of the methods are that they are non‐invasive, and that measurements are made at very high resolution in time and space, yielding estimates that are comparable across species and studies.

We investigated the fauna of 8 historical shipwrecks off the US east coast to assess whether species distribution patterns on the shipwrecks fit models from classical island theory. Invertebrates on the shipwrecks included both sessile (sponges, anemones, hydroids) and motile (crustaceans, echinoderms) species. Invertebrate communities were significantly different among wrecks. The size and distance between wrecks influenced the biotic communities, much like on terrestrial islands. However, while wreck size influenced species richness (alpha diversity), distance to the nearest wreck influenced community composition (beta diversity). Alpha and beta diversity on the shipwrecks were thus influenced by different abiotic factors. We found no evidence of either nested patterns or non-random co-occurrence of morphotypes, suggesting that the taxa on a given shipwreck were randomly selected from the available taxon pool. Species present on the shipwrecks generally had 1 of 2 reproductive modes: most motile or solitary sessile species had long-duration planktotrophic larvae, while most encrusting or colonial sessile species had short-duration lecithotrophic larvae and underwent asexual reproduction by budding as adults. Short-duration larvae may recruit to their natal shipwreck, allowing them to build up dense populations and dominate the wreck surfaces. A high degree of dominance was indeed observed on the wrecks, with up to 80% of the fauna being accounted for by the most common species alone. By comparing the shipwreck communities to known patterns of succession in shallow water, we hypothesize that the shipwrecks are in a stage of mid-succession.

Taking into account the essential significance of fluvial environments for the Amazonian biota, we propose that an enhanced understanding of the Amazonian riverscape will provide new insight for biogeographical studies in the region and contribute to the understanding of these megadiverse tropical lowlands.
 
 Location An area of 2.2 million km2 covering the Western Amazonian lowlands of the Andean foreland region, i.e. the upper reaches of the Amazon river system. Areas in Colombia, Venezuela, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil and Bolivia between longitudes 83 °W and 65 °W and latitudes 5 °N and 12 °S are included.
 
 Methods A mosaic of 120 Landsat TM satellite images was created with 100-m resolution, and water areas of over 1 ha in size or c. 60 m in width were extracted using a simple ratio threshold applicable to a large set of data. With this method, 99.1% of the water areas present in 30-m imagery were mapped with images with 100-m resolution. Water pixels of distinct river segments were assigned to river classes on the basis of their channel properties, and islands and lakes were distinguished separately and classified. Measures of water patterns such as structure, composition, richness and remoteness were provided for various spatial units. Riverine corridors were computed from the open-water mask by outer limits of active channels and floodplain lakes. Analytical results are shown as both thematic maps and statistics.
 
 Results A total of 1.1% of Western Amazonia is covered by open-water bodies over 1 ha in size or 60 m in width. River-bound waters comprise 98% of the total water surface. Whilst isolated lakes are scarce, river-bound oxbow and backchannel lakes are plentiful, comprising 17.5% of all waters. They are particularly frequent along meandering channels, which dominate both in area and length. The riverine corridors including active channels and floodplain lakes cover 17% of the land area. The average distance from any point of land to the nearest water is 12 km. Geographically speaking, the distribution of waters is uneven across the region, and the detailed characteristics of the riverscape are geographically highly variable. Three major, fluvially distinct regions can be identified: central Western Amazonia, the south, and the north-east. The proportional surface areas of the riverine corridors, numbers of lakes, sizes of islands and their distributions depend largely on the types and sizes of the rivers.
 
 Main conclusions Our results support the notion of Western Amazonia as a dynamic, highly fluvial environment, highlighting and quantifying considerable internal variation within the region in terms of fluvial patterns and the processes that they reflect and control. Biogeographically, the variety of types of fluvial environments and their characteristics are important constituents of what influences the distribution of species and dynamics of terrestrial habitats.

Methods: A mosaic of 120 Landsat TM satellite images was created with 100-m resolution, and water areas of over 1 ha in size or c. 60 m in width were extracted using a simple ratio threshold applicable to a large set of data. With this method, 99.1% of the water areas present in 30-m imagery were mapped with images with 100-m resolution. Water pixels of distinct river segments were assigned to river classes on the basis of their channel properties, and islands and lakes were distinguished separately and classified. Measures of water patterns such as structure, composition, richness and remoteness were provided for various spatial units. Riverine corridors were computed from the open-water mask by outer limits of active channels and floodplain lakes. Analytical results are shown as both thematic maps and statistics. Results: A total of 1.1% of Western Amazonia is covered by open-water bodies over 1 ha in size or 60 m in width. River-bound waters comprise 98% of the total water surface. Whilst isolated lakes are scarce, river-bound oxbow and backchannel lakes are plentiful, comprising 17.5% of all waters. They are particularly frequent along meandering channels, which dominate both in area and length. The riverine corridors including active channels and floodplain lakes cover 17% of the land area. The average distance from any point of land to the nearest water is 12 km. Geographically speaking, the distribution of waters is uneven across the region, and the detailed characteristics of the riverscape are geographically highly variable. Three major, fluvially distinct regions can be identified: central Western Amazonia, the south, and the north-east. The proportional surface areas of the riverine corridors, numbers of lakes, sizes of islands and their distributions depend largely on the types and sizes of the rivers. Main conclusions: Our results support the notion of Western Amazonia as a dynamic, highly fluvial environment, highlighting and quantifying considerable internal variation within the region in terms of fluvial patterns and the processes that they reflect and control. Biogeographically, the variety of types of fluvial environments and their characteristics are important constituents of what influences the distribution of species and dynamics of terrestrial habitats. Spatially consistent riverscape data can serve as a consistent and scalable source of relevant information for other biogeographical approaches in the region. © 2007 The Authors.",2007,2025-04-16 10:12:03,2025-04-16 10:12:03,,1374-1387,,8,34,,J.

312,"Two Genetically Distinct Populations of Bobtail Squid, Euprymna scolopes, Exist on the Island of O'ahu","Kimbell, Jennifer; McFall‐Ngai, Margaret; Roderick, George",2002,Pacific Science,https://doi.org/10.1353/psc.2002.0024,10.1353/psc.2002.0024,"Two Genetically Distinct Populations of Bobtail Squid, Euprymna scolopes, Exist on the Island of O'ahu1 J. R. Kimbell, M. J. McFall-Ngai, and G. K. Roderick Abstract Population structure of the endemic Hawaiian bobtail squid, Euprymna scolopes, was examined using both morphological and genetic data. Although allozyme polymorphism was negligible, measurements of eggs, juveniles, and adults, as well as genetic data sequences of mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase I, demonstrated highly significant population structuring between two populations found on the northeastern and southern coasts of the island of O'ahu. These data suggest that extremely low levels of gene flow occur among these populations. Population subdivision of marine shallow-water invertebrates in Hawai'i is not expected based on earlier surveys, but may reflect a more general pattern for organisms, both marine and terrestrial, that exhibit limited dispersal. The subdivision also provides insight into the pathway through which coevolution between E. scolopes and its internal symbiont, Vibrio fischeri, may proceed. The Hawaiian Archipelago presents unique opportunities for the study of evolutionary biology because of its relative isolation, high levels of endemism, and the explosive radiation of a number of taxa (Simon 1987, Wagner and Funk 1995). For example, the terrestrial invertebrate biota, which has been particularly well studied in genera such as Drosophila flies, Tetragnatha spiders, and Achatinellinae tree snails, typically exhibits extensive adaptive radiations comprising species endemic to the archipelago (Roderick and Gillespie 1998, Thacker and Hadfield 2000). These patterns are thought to result from the extremely heterogeneous nature of the terrestrial island landscape, which presents an abundance of spatially limited, yet distinct, niches ripe for adaptive radiation (Gillespie et al. 2001). Marine invertebrates, however, have much lower rates of endemism than their terrestrial counterparts, with endemism ranging from 2 to 20% for nearshore gastropods, brachyuran decapods, and certain polychaetes and echinoderms of the central Pacific (Scheltema 1986, Kay and Palumbi 1987). These benthic marine invertebrates appear instead to represent attenuated Indo-Pacific fauna, and the marine endemic species that do exist are usually distributed throughout all of the islands of the archipelago (Scheltema 1986). The wide geographic distributions of these marine invertebrate species indicate that fairly high gene flow must be occurring between populations within species (Palumbi 1992). Such gene flow is presumably facilitated by long planktonic larval phases, which ensure high dispersal. Yet, within such widespread species some population structure may nevertheless persist (Barber et al. 2000). Although much is known about marine invertebrate species with extended larval life histories, less is understood about species that do not have broadly dispersing larval or juvenile stages. One such species is the bobtail squid, Euprymna scolopes, which is endemic to [End Page 347] the Hawaiian Islands (Singley 1983). Female E. scolopes lay clutches of eggs on hard substrates in the shallow waters of the back reef. No true larval stages occur in this species (i.e., the juveniles hatch with a morphology and behavior very similar to those of the adult [Arnold et al. 1972]). Specifically, after a brief planktonic stage of hours to a few days, the juvenile squid take on the diel pattern of behavior characteristic of the species (i.e., they bury in the sand during the day and forage in the water column at night). Previously, it was observed that E. scolopes is notable for its habitat loyalty, and it has been suggested that two reproductively isolated populations exist on northeastern and southern coasts of the island of O'ahu (Singley 1983). The E. scolopes-Vibrio fischeri association has become a model for animal-bacterial symbiosis and in particular the persistent colonization of animal epithelia by extracellular bacteria (McFall-Ngai and Ruby 1998). Recent studies of the squid-vibrio symbioses at the level of species have provided strong evidence for coevolution of the host and symbiont (Nishiguchi et al. 1998). Whether population subdivision of E. scolopes exists is critical to understanding the co-evolution of this species with its bacteria partners—how isolated are populations of E. scolopes and at what scale would population-specific strains of V. fischeri be expected to evolve? In this study we tested the hypothesis of population subdivision of E. scolopes with both morphological and genetic data. Our results indicate...",,Terrestrial Biodiversity (Population);,,negative,10.1353/psc.2002.0024,9097,1152,9098,GHSI2JTP,journalArticle,2002,"Kimbell, J.R.; McFall-Ngai, M.J.; Roderick, G.K.","Two genetically distinct populations of bobtail squid, Euprymna scolopes, exist on the Island of O'ahu",Pacific Science,,00308870 (ISSN),10.1353/psc.2002.0024,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0036379120&doi=10.1353%2fpsc.2002.0024&partnerID=40&md5=511c62698109b5ef62f13947814cfc41,"Population structure of the endemic Hawaiian bobtail squid, Euprymna scolopes, was examined using both morphological and genetic data.

Thus, sedimentary disturbance regimes in which coastal marine benthic communities have evolved may be shifting as depositional events exceeding critical thresholds become more frequent. To understand the threat posed by terrigenous sedimentation in an embayment with increasing urban development, we determined the thickness and frequency at which terrigenous sediment deposits begin to affect the benthos. We performed manipulative experiments involving layers of terrigenous sediment <1 cm thick in a variety of intertidal habitats in the Whitford embayment, North Island, New Zealand. Results of 3 separate experiments performed at 5 sites were largely consistent. While experimental plots were never completely defaunated, as little as 3 mm of the terrigenous material was sufficient to significantly alter macrobenthic community structure (measured after 10 d, relative to 0 mm controls). The direction of change was predominantly negative; the number of individuals and taxa declined as a result of sediment application, as did the densities of nearly every common species. Large bivalves were less affected than smaller ones, and deeper-dwelling species were less affected than ones at the sediment surface. With repeated applications of thin terrigenous layers (3 mm thickness, monthly over a 6 mo period), the sandflat sediments gradually became finer (clay volume % increased), and macrofaunal community composition progressively diverged from controls. To summarise, macrofauna were negatively affected by extremely small amounts of terrigenous sediment, and repeated depositional events did more damage than single ones. With increasing defoliation and excavation of catchment hillsides, the frequency of depositional events of a given intensity is likely to quicken, indicating an enhanced likelihood of macrofaunal disturbance and degradation in estuarine tidal flats. Management decisions that protect coastal catchments may partially ameliorate the threat to the benthos in coastal receiving waters.

Recent theoretical and empirical research has shown that habitat isolation can have strong effects on patterns of abundance and population dynamics of animals. Effects of habitat patch isolation may be particularly strong in taxa such as amphibians, which may have limited dispersal abilities and yet rely on breeding habitats that are variable in space and time. 2. We manipulated the distribution of replicated artificial ponds in order to determine the effects of breeding pond isolation on the spatial and temporal dynamics of pond use by the tungara frog ( Physalaemus pustulosus Lynch), on Barro Colorado Island (BCI), Panama. Our principal objectives were to determine whether pond isolation affects if, when, and how much a pond will be used, and to determine the spatial scale over which isolation effects are likely to be important. 3. We used three sets of experimental ponds: ponds placed at distances from 1 to 200 m from active natural breeding sites; ponds placed at these same distances from recently abandoned breeding sites; and ponds placed among different terrestrial habitat types and at least 200 m from any known breeding sites (‘sampling ponds’). 4. We found that time to pond use increased with pond isolation, and that ponds near active sites were used more quickly than ponds near abandoned sites. The number of egg masses per pond decreased with pond isolation and was significantly lower near abandoned sites. Ponds near active breeding sites were more likely to be used by tungara frogs than both ponds near abandoned sites and sampling ponds. 5. Used sampling ponds were clumped at spatial scales less than 200 m, and mark–recapture data suggest that tungara frogs routinely move between ponds over these distances. 6. We conclude that breeding pond isolation is a primary determinant of the temporal and spatial dynamics of pond use by tungara frogs, and can result in spatial patterns in pond use that are independent of pond quality.

 of terrestrial earthworms that are now known from the island. In our survey, pheretimoid earthworms made
 up about half of the total number of the species, while the exotic Pontoscolex corethrurus (Müller, 1856)

However, communities occupying patchy environments typically exhibit non‐random distributions in which local assemblages of species‐poor patches are nested subsets of assemblages occupying more species‐rich patches. Nestedness of local communities implies interspecific differences in sensitivity to patchiness. Several hypotheses have been proposed to explain interspecific variation in responses to patchiness within a community, including differences in (1) colonization ability, (2) extinction proneness, (3) tolerance to disturbance, (4) sociality and (5) level of adaptation to prevailing environmental conditions. We used data on North American mammals to compare the performance of these ‘ecological’ hypotheses and the ‘physical landscape’ hypothesis. We then compared the best of these models against models that scaled landscape structure to ecologically relevant attributes of individual species. Location North America. Methods We analysed data on prevalence (i.e. proportion of patches occupied in a network of patches) and occupancy for 137 species of non‐volant mammals and twenty networks consisting of four to seventy‐five patches. Insular and terrestrial networks exhibited significantly different mean levels of prevalence and occupancy and thus were analysed separately. Indicator variables at ordinal and family levels were included in models to correct for effects caused by phylogeny. Akaike's information criterion was used in conjunction with ordinary least squares and logistic regression to compare hypotheses. Results A patch network's physical structure, indexed using patch area and isolation, received the greatest support among models predicting the prevalence of species on insular networks. Niche breadth (diet and habitat) received the greatest support for predicting prevalence of species occupying terrestrial networks. For both insular and terrestrial systems, physical features (patch area and isolation) received greater support than any of the ecological hypotheses for predicting species occupancy of individual patches. For terrestrial systems, scaling patch area by its suitability to a focal species and by individual area requirements of the species, and scaling patch isolation by species‐specific dispersal ability and niche breadth, resulted in models of patch occupancy that were superior to models relying solely on physical landscape features. For all selected models, unexplained levels of variation were high. Main conclusions Stochasticity dominated the systems we studied, indicating that random events are probably quite important in shaping local communities. With respect to deterministic factors, our results suggest that forces affecting species prevalence and occupancy may differ between insular and terrestrial systems. Physical features of insular systems appeared to swamp ecological differences among species in determining prevalence and occupancy, whereas species with broad niches were disproportionately represented in terrestrial networks. We hypothesize that differential extinction over long time periods in highly variable networks has driven nestedness of mammalian communities on islands, whereas differential colonization over shorter time‐scales in more homogeneous networks probably governed the local structure of terrestrial communities. Our results also demonstrate that integration of a species' ecological traits with physical features of a patch network is superior to reliance on either factor separately when attempting to predict the species' probability of patch occupancy in terrestrial systems.",Island (Population);,,,negative,10.1046/j.1365-2699.2003.00925.x,11308,1373,11309,RZG3M22Q,journalArticle,2003,"Swihart, R.K.; Atwood, T.C.; Goheen, J.R.; Scheiman, D.M.; Munroe, K.E.; Gehring, T.M.",Patch occupancy of north american mammals: Is patchiness in the eye of the beholder?,Journal of Biogeography,,03050270 (ISSN),10.1046/j.1365-2699.2003.00925.x,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0042734537&doi=10.1046%2fj.1365-2699.2003.00925.x&partnerID=40&md5=65065792ff85627ed181a3b86274326f,"Aim: Intraspecific variation in patch occupancy often is related to physical features of a landscape, such as the amount and distribution of habitat.

We hypothesize that differential extinction over long time periods in highly variable networks has driven nestedness of mammalian communities on islands, whereas differential colonization over shorter time-scales in more homogeneous networks probably governed the local structure of terrestrial communities. Our results also demonstrate that integration of a species' ecological traits with physical features of a patch network is superior to reliance on either factor separately when attempting to predict the species' probability of patch occupancy in terrestrial systems.",2003,2025-04-16 10:10:39,2025-04-16 10:10:39,,1259-1279,,8,30,,J.

Specifically non-silicate minerals may contribute significantly to the weathering derived fluxes from silicate-dominated lithological classes. The Japanese Archipelago consists of predominantly silicate-dominated lithologies with a high proportion of volcanics. However, the spatially explicit representation of chemical weathering rates remains difficult for such a large region, because many controlling factors on chemical weathering rates are correlated with each other. Due to the spatial heterogeneity of lithology, a multi-lithological model approach to estimate spatially explicit chemical weathering rates for unmonitored areas is applied here. To achieve this, hydrochemical data of 381 catchments are used to train a set of models, recognizing the contribution of a variety of proposed factors influencing chemical silicate rock weathering rates (CSRWR: cations plus dissolved silica flux). The monitored catchments cover ~ 44% of the Japanese Archipelago. Cation chemical weathering rates (excluding Si) are linearly correlated with CSRWR and show outliers if basic volcanics or pyroclastic flows are present due to increased silica release rates. Lithology and runoff are identified as the strongest predictors for chemical weathering rates. Temperature and gradient of slope are of less relevance for the regional scale prediction while further proposed factors like soil properties or land cover are not identified as major predictors. Latter findings are partly attributed to geodata quality, low variability of parameter values as well as spatial correlations of proposed controlling factors with lithology or runoff. The calculated average CSRWR of the Archipelago is ~ 25 t km−2 a− 1 and ranges from 5.9 to 107 t km−2 a− 1 in monitored catchments. Weathering rates per lithological class as a function of runoff can be grouped into three classes: a) pyroclastic flows showing the highest chemical weathering rates; b) alluvial deposits, mixed sediments and basic to intermediate volcanics with medium rates; and c) metamorphics, siliciclastic sediments, acid volcanics, acid plutonics and unconsolidated sediments (other than alluvial deposits), showing the lowest rates. The recognition of lithogenic sulfur would add 9.7% to CSRWR of considered catchments. Results suggest that the lithological classes acid volcanics and unconsolidated sediments contribute above average to the sulfur fluxes. Possible biases of this observation are discussed. The contribution of Ca-fluxes from non-silicate calcic minerals (named Ca-excess, Ca-fluxes in addition to silicate Ca-fluxes) is about 10% of the CSRWR on average and is attributed by a wide value range. The calculated ratio ""Ca-excess to total Ca-fluxes"" from chemical weathering averages around 62%, 75%, 56%, 83% and 84% for the lithological classes acid plutonics, metamorphics, siliciclastic sediments, mixed sediments and acid volcanics, respectively. This suggests a major Ca-contribution from non-silicate calcic minerals for these lithological classes. Phosphorus release from rocks due to chemical weathering is estimated to be between 1 kg P km−2 a− 1 and 390 kg P km−2 a− 1. The P-release patterns in dependence of runoff per lithological class are different from CSRWRs due to differences of applied P-content in rocks. The identified spatial P-release patterns suggest that the consideration of dynamic and spatially resolved P-release rates by chemical weathering might improve ecosystem studies. Later findings may be of importance for analysing the influence of P-release from rocks on the climate system via ecosystem functioning on geological time scales.

Major mortality agents of seeds were bruchid beetles (Amblycerus tachygaliae) and terrestrial vertebrates, while vertebrate herbivores and damping—off fungi killed seedlings. Seedlings survival and growth were enhanced under canopies of dying T. versicolor adults, relative to under canopies of living conspecific and nonconspecific adults. The majority of 2—yr—old seedlings occurred within 0.40 m from the parent trees, reflecting the original peak of the distribution of wind—dispersed seeds. Few seedlings persisted beyond 40 m. Seedling survival in the first 2 mo was higher in shaded understory than in light—gaps, due to higher vertebrate herbivory in sun than shade. Seedling growth and survival beyond 2 mo was higher in light—gaps than in shaded understory. T. versicolor seedlings exhibited a wide range in maximum net photosynthetic rate when grown in contrasting light conditions, and were able to acclimate to a sudden increase in light level by means of morphological and physiological adjustments of newly developed leaves. These results indicate that T. versicolor can utilize a wide range of light environments in the forest during seedling establishment. Relative to nomonocarpic wind—dispersed tree species previously studied in the same community. T. versicolor ranks near the top in its seed mass, dispersal capability, photosynthetic flexibility to contrasting light conditions, and probability of seedling survival in the shaded understory through 1 yr. These characteristics enable T. versicolor to establish large numbers of seedlings. The mean total number of offspring of two trees estimated to survive through 2 yr was 4395 out of 103 055 dispersed seeds and 30 529 germinated seeds.

 Despite a growing number of river restoration projects in Central Europe targeting hydromorphological improvements, it is still uncommon to evaluate the effects of restoration. Hydromorphological diversity in straightened, single-channel sections was compared with restored or naturally developed multiple-channel sections in German mountain rivers to identify parameters suitable for judging conservation value or restoration success.
 
 2.
 Seven multiple-channel sections were compared with nearby straightened single-channel sections. Six hydromorphological parameters at macro-, meso- and micro-scales were recorded with transect point protocols, including aquatic, terrestrial and transient areas and width of channel features (main and secondary channels, sidearms, standing water bodies, bars, banks, floodplains and embankments). Depth, velocity and substrate type were measured at 400 points per river section. With these data 12 metrics were calculated, to provide comparison between the sections.
 
 3.
 All macro- and meso-scale parameters were well differentiated between single-channel and multiple-channel sections: mean channel width and shoreline length increased by factors of 2.1 and 2.4, respectively; the average number of channel feature types increased from two to 10 per section.
 
 4.
 Micro-scale parameters, such as velocity and depth variance, were significantly different between single-channel sections and most multiple-channel sections. Substrate composition was more diverse in the restored sections; the share of the major substrate was on average reduced from 75% to 62%. The Spatial Diversity Index described differences in substrate patterns best. The individual parameters correlated only within scales, but rarely between them.
 
 5.
 Rapid assessment of restoration success or judgement of conservation value is made possible by combining simple macro- and meso-scale parameters, e.g. increase of overall width or of transient areas, and presence of bars and islands. Increase in aquatic area and diversity of habitats are the most appropriate micro-scale parameters required to evaluate habitat suitability for aquatic organisms.

The Spatial Diversity Index described differences in substrate patterns best. The individual parameters correlated only within scales, but rarely between them. 5. Rapid assessment of restoration success or judgement of conservation value is made possible by combining simple macro- and meso-scale parameters, e.g. increase of overall width or of transient areas, and presence of bars and islands. Increase in aquatic area and diversity of habitats are the most appropriate micro-scale parameters required to evaluate habitat suitability for aquatic organisms. For depth and velocity data, variance should be analysed. Copyright © 2008 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",2008,2025-04-16 10:12:41,2025-04-16 10:12:41,,1200-1216,,7,18,,Aquatic Conserv. Mar. Freshw.

Owing to its voracious appetite, wide environmental adaptability, high growth rate, and reproductive capacity, it has become an invasive species across the world, mainly in Southeast Asia, Japan, the western Pacific islands, and China. This pest can damage agricultural crops and is an intermediate host of many parasites that can threaten human health. However, genomic information of A. fulica remains limited, hindering genetic and genomic studies for invasion control and management of the species. Findings Using a k-mer–based method, we estimated the A. fulica genome size to be 2.12 Gb, with a high repeat content up to 71%. Roughly 101.6 Gb genomic long-read data of A. fulica were generated from the Pacific Biosciences sequencing platform and assembled to produce a first A. fulica genome of 1.85 Gb with a contig N50 length of 726 kb. Using contact information from the Hi-C sequencing data, we successfully anchored 99.32% contig sequences into 31 chromosomes, leading to the final contig and scaffold N50 length of 721 kb and 59.6 Mb, respectively. The continuity, completeness, and accuracy were evaluated by genome comparison with other mollusk genomes, BUSCO assessment, and genomic read mapping. A total of 23,726 protein-coding genes were predicted from the assembled genome, among which 96.34% of the genes were functionally annotated. The phylogenetic analysis using whole-genome protein-coding genes revealed that A. fulica separated from a common ancestor with Biomphalaria glabrata ~182 million years ago. Conclusion To our knowledge, the A. fulica genome is the first terrestrial mollusk genome published to date.

By simulating the presence of wolves (Canis lupus), tigers (Panthera tigris), and brown bears (Ursus arctos) at 19 transcontinental sites, I assayed three metrics of prey performance in areas with no large terrestrial carnivores (the polar islands of Greenland and Svalbard), extant native carnivores (Eastern Siberian Shield, boreal Canada, and Alaska); and repatriated carnivores (the Yellowstone region and Rocky Mountains). The loss and reestablishment of large carnivores changed the ecological effectiveness of systems by (1) dampening immediate group benefits, diminishing awareness, and diminishing flight reaction in caribou (Rangifer tarandus) where predation was eliminated and (2) reinstituting sensitivity to carnivores by elk (Cervus elaphus) and moose (Alces alces) in the Yellowstone region to levels observed in Asian elk when sympatric with Siberian tigers and wolves or in Alaskan moose sympatric with wolves.

We describe the dietary and behavioural responses of dingoes (Canis familiaris) to the occurrence of large-animal marine strandings (e.g. dead cetaceans, marine turtles and pinnipeds) between 2006 and 2016 on K’gari (Fraser Island), Australia, to better understand the trophic links between marine and terrestrial systems. A total of 309 strandings were recorded during this period (~3.1 strandings per month), yielding an annual average of 30.3 tons of available carrion to the 100–200 dingoes present on the island. Carcass monitoring with camera traps showed that dingoes used carcasses almost daily after a short period of decomposition.

We describe the dietary and behavioural responses of dingoes (Canis familiaris) to the occurrence of large-animal marine strandings (e.g. dead cetaceans, marine turtles and pinnipeds) between 2006 and 2016 on K'gari (Fraser Island), Australia, to better understand the trophic links between marine and terrestrial systems. A total of 309 strandings were recorded during this period (∼3.1 strandings per month), yielding an annual average of 30.3 tons of available carrion to the 100-200 dingoes present on the island.

461,Hypopterygiaceae of the World,"Kruijer, Johannes",2002,Blumea. Supplement,,,"This publication presents a systematic study of the Hypopterygiaceae Mitt. s.l., a small family of pleurocarpous mosses. It includes a taxonomic revision and phylogenetic analyses to clarify the circumscription of the family and the mutual relationships of its genera and species. The Hypopterygiaceae have a mainly Gondwanan distribution and occur in humid forests of (warm-)temperate to tropical areas of the world. They are characterised by having partly or entirely complanate foliate stems and branches, whereby the leaves are arranged in two rows of asymmetrical, lateral leaves and a single, ventral row of smaller, symmetrical amphigastria. Seven genera are recognised. The c. 160 validly published species and intraspecific taxa are reduced to 21 species. The family shows its greatest diversity in Indo Malaysia (11 species) and Australasia (9 species). Africa and the New World are poor in species with, respectively, 3 and 5 representatives. In the past, the Hypopterygiaceae were regarded as a monophyletic family, but during the last twenty years this status has frequently been discussed. Several authors suggested the Hypopterygiaceae to be polyphyletic, while others still regarded the family as monophyletic. However, a series of phylogenetic analyses performed in this study — based on 57 morphological characters and, initially, 34 species, including the Hypopterygiaceae and representatives of possibly related families — supports the monophyletic status of the Hypopterygiaceae. Based on the outcomes of the analyses, the genus Cyathophorella (Broth.) M. Fleisch. is united with Cyathophorum P. Beauv., which results in the well-supported, monophyletic genus Cyathophorum with 7 species. The genus is nested in a monophyletic Dendrocyathophorum Lopidium Cyathophorum clade. Lopidium Hook. f. & Wilson is a well-supported monophyletic genus of two species. Dendrocyathophorum Dixon is a monotypic genus that is maintained as a separate genus. One of the most characteristic features of Dendrocyathophorum, the central cavity in its axes, is a plesiomorphic condition and a synapomorphy of the DENDROCYATHOPHORUM L0PIDIUM C YATHOPHORUM CLADE Hypopterygium Brid. is a paraphyletic genus of 7 species, which has a basal position to the Dendrocyathophorum-Lopidium-Cyathophorum clade. The monotypic genera Catharomnion Hook. f. & Wilson and Canalohypopterygium W. Frey & Schaepe form a monophyletic clade with a basal position to the Hypopterygium grade. Catharomnion and Canalohypopterygium share the — for mosses unique — rudimentary branches and associated cavity system, but are maintained as separate genera, because of distinct morphological differences, in particular in sporophytic characters. Dendrohypopterygium is a newly described paraphyletic genus of two species, which has a basal position to the Hypopterygiaceae in the obtained phylogenetic trees. The distribution of extant Hypopterygiaceae is probably the result of a combination of dispersal and continental drift acting as vicariance and speciation events. Dispersal of Hypopterygiaceae occurs by means of detached branch fragments, detached leaves, gemmae, and spores. Vegetative propagulae and a portion of the spores mainly contribute to local dispersal and the maintenance and growth of local populations. Dispersal by spores is most common over longer distances. However, the survival rate of spores of Hypopterygiaceae under conditions occurring during long-distance transport in air streams is low. Effective long-range dispersal is probably rare in Hypopterygiaceae, and may have occurred only few times in the history of the family (e.g. Hypopterygium sandwicense on the Hawaiian Islands). Endemism in New Zealand, Australia, and South America suggests that the origin of the Hypopterygiaceae is situated in East Gondwanaland. The presumably terrestrial, dendroid ancestral species were probably distributed in active mountain ranges on the margin of the continent and faced cool temperate conditions and occupied humid, terrestrial habitats at low altitude. Descendants of the cool-temperate ancestor(s) probably moved to higher altitudes due to climatic changes in the course of the Cretaceous. Speciation was induced as a result of fragmentation of the original distribution area in combination with a change of ecological conditions towards a higher humidity and precipitation. Descendants of the terrestrial ancestral species became epiphytic and epilithic. The rise and radiation of angiosperms have presumably favoured the appearance of epiphytes. The Hypopterygiaceae are probably at least 84 million years old, but presumably much older. The existence of most extant species and their present distribution can be explained by northwards rafting on drifting fragments of East Gondwanaland during the Cretaceous or Cenozoic period in combination with mainly short range dispersal events. It seems that Hypopterygiaceae experienced low evolution rates, but part of the family faced probably a Cretaceous radiation event eventually resulting in the appearance of pinnate or simple epiphytic species. Intraspecific variation that is found in some Hypopterygium-species (H. tamarisci, H. flavolimbatum, and H. didictyon) is perhaps of Late Cenozoic origin, and may represent an early stage of a second radiation event due to the climatic changes in the Late Cenozoic.",Island (Population);,,,negative,nan,0,1360,1,GAY9UFPD,journalArticle,2003,"Barré, N.; Bachy, P.",Complement to the list of the birds of New Caledonia,Alauda,,00024619 (ISSN),,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0038672025&partnerID=40&md5=08686e36ebe228a5d4ae2f144e92ed87,"Over the last five years, ten species of birds not previously known on the island have been seen, increasing the number of species/subspecies recorded in New Caledonia to about 192 taxa.

This can restrict gene flow among populations and may promote genetic differentiation and the evolution of endemic populations or species among the forested terrestrial islands. The region has experienced cycles of cooling and warming throughout the Pleistocene and the current isolation among populations may date back only c. 11,000 years. Thus, some studies have found genetic structure that predates the current distribution of organisms. The effect of habitat fragmentation on genetic structure was tested using DNA sequences in a highly specialized herbivorous insect, grape phylloxera, Daktulosphaira vitifoliae, that exhibits poor dispersal capacity and natal-host associated mating that would seem to predispose it to genetic differentiation.

485,Effects of climate change on seagrasses and seagrass habitats relevant to the Pacific Islands,"Brodie, Gilianne; De Ramon N’Yeurt, Antoine",2018,,,,"Due to anthropogenic pressure, seagrass habitats are declining by over 7% annually worldwide, with approximately 29% of the world seagrass stock having already been destroyed. Losses in seagrass habitats for the tropical Pacific by the year 2100 are estimated to be between 5 to 35%, but a lack of knowledge on the extent and area cover of seagrass resources in Pacific Island Countries and Territories (PICTs) does not allow accurate assessments of resource status, or losses and gains in seagrass cover to be made. Low human resource capacity and little awareness by the general public and business community of the economic value and importance of seagrass ecosystem services, including a lack of inclusion of seagrass habitats at a regional policy level, is severely hampering conservation efforts. Seagrasses and seagrass habitats provide at least 24 different service benefits in the Indo-Pacific region. These include coastal protection, provision of food, cultural value and exceptional carbon storage ability beyond terrestrial forests. If properly managed, seagrass habitats could provide a highly significant carbon mitigation service in a high-CO2 world through a net influx of organic carbon both above and belowground. Massive seagrass carbon storage losses have recently been recorded in Australia after a period of elevated seawater temperature, and increased oceanic temperature will be one of the most important environmental stressors on seagrass habitats. Different tropical seagrass species show different tolerances to increased seawater temperatures, but thermal tolerance has not been well studied in seagrass in PICTs. Increases in seawater temperature also translate into stronger extreme weather events such as heavy rainfall and tropical cyclones and storms, which put additional stress on seagrass habitats through direct physical damage, increase in turbidity causing reductions in photosynthetic rates and growth, and a general loss of ecosystem resilience and productivity. Both gains and losses to seagrass resources will result from climate change, with increases in productivity due to higher CO2 levels being buffered by the negative consequences of higher seawater temperatures and most importantly additional anthropogenic factors such as “polluted” land runoff. These factors are very likely to be currently resulting in increasing losses of vital ecosystem services in the Pacific islands.",,Terrestrial Biodiversity (Population);,,negative,nan,0,1360,1,GAY9UFPD,journalArticle,2003,"Barré, N.; Bachy, P.",Complement to the list of the birds of New Caledonia,Alauda,,00024619 (ISSN),,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0038672025&partnerID=40&md5=08686e36ebe228a5d4ae2f144e92ed87,"Over the last five years, ten species of birds not previously known on the island have been seen, increasing the number of species/subspecies recorded in New Caledonia to about 192 taxa.

Despite being an evidence-based discipline, to date there has been no comprehensive review of the outcomes of systematic conservation plans and assessments of the relative effectiveness of applications in different contexts. To address this fundamental gap in knowledge, our primary research question was: what is the extent, distribution and robustness of evidence on conservation outcomes of systematic conservation planning around the globe? Methods A systematic mapping exercise was undertaken using standardised search terms across 29 sources, including publication databases, online repositories and a wide range of grey literature sources. The review team screened articles recursively, first by title only, then abstract and finally by full-text, using inclusion criteria related to systematic conservation plans conducted at sub-global scales and reported on since 1983. We sought studies that reported outcomes relating to natural, human, social, financial or institutional outcomes and which employed robust evaluation study designs. The following information was extracted from included studies: bibliographic details, background information including location of study and broad objectives of the plan, study design, reported outcomes and context. Results Of the approximately 10,000 unique articles returned through our searches, 1209 were included for full-text screening and 43 studies reported outcomes of conservation planning interventions. However, only three studies involved the use of evaluation study designs which are suitably rigorous for inclusion, according to best-practice guidelines. The three included studies were undertaken in the Gulf of California (Mexico), Réunion Island, and The Nature Conservancy’s landholdings across the USA. The studies varied widely in context, purpose and outcomes. Study designs were non-experimental or qualitative, and involved use of spatial landholdings over time, stakeholder surveys and modelling of alternative planning scenarios. Conclusion Rigorous evaluations of systematic conservation plans are currently not published in academic journals or made publicly available elsewhere. Despite frequent claims relating to positive implications and outcomes of these planning activities, we show that evaluations are probably rarely conducted. This finding does not imply systematic conservation planning is not effective but highlights a significant gap in our understanding of how, when and why it may or may not be effective. Our results also corroborate claims that the literature on systematic conservation planning is dominated by methodological studies, rather than those that focus on implementation and outcomes, and support the case that this is a problematic imbalance in the literature. We emphasise the need for academics and practitioners to publish the outcomes of systematic conservation planning exercises and to consider employing robust evaluation methodologies when reporting project outcomes.

We examined the importance of vegetation cover, predation, and tourism on the distribution of nests among islands. We found all nests only on islands and islets.

The perhumid region of the coastal temperate rainforest (CTR) of Pacific North America is one of the wettest places on Earth and contains numerous small catchments that discharge freshwater and high concentrations of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) directly to the coastal ocean. However, empirical data on the flux and composition of DOC exported from these watersheds are scarce. We established monitoring stations at the outlets of seven catchments on Calvert and Hecate islands, British Columbia, which represent the rain-dominated hypermaritime region of the perhumid CTR. Over several years, we measured stream discharge, stream water DOC concentration, and stream water dissolved organic-matter (DOM) composition. Discharge and DOC concentrations were used to calculate DOC fluxes and yields, and DOM composition was characterized using absorbance and fluorescence spectroscopy with parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC). The areal estimate of annual DOC yield in water year 2015 was 33.3 Mg C km−2 yr−1, with individual watersheds ranging from an average of 24.1 to 37.7 Mg C km−2 yr−1. This represents some of the highest DOC yields to be measured at the coastal margin. We observed seasonality in the quantity and composition of exports, with the majority of DOC export occurring during the extended wet period (September–April). Stream flow from catchments reacted quickly to rain inputs, resulting in rapid export of relatively fresh, highly terrestrial-like DOM. DOC concentration and measures of DOM composition were related to stream discharge and stream temperature and correlated with watershed attributes, including the extent of lakes and wetlands, and the thickness of organic and mineral soil horizons. Our discovery of high DOC yields from these small catchments in the CTR is especially compelling as they deliver relatively fresh, highly terrestrial organic matter directly to the coastal ocean.

As historically more focus has been put on the terrestrial realm in examining diversification and evolutionary processes on oceanic islands, publicly accessible and spatially resolved data of marine reef ecosystems remain scarce. To address this issue, we conducted the first environmental DNA (eDNA) metabarcoding surveys of the actinopterygian (ray‐finned) and elasmobranch fishes and of Scleractinia coral assemblages in the waters of the Ogasawara Islands.

As historically more focus has been put on the terrestrial realm in examining diversification and evolutionary processes on oceanic islands, publicly accessible and spatially resolved data of marine reef ecosystems remain scarce. To address this issue, we conducted the first environmental DNA (eDNA) metabarcoding surveys of the actinopterygian (ray-finned) and elasmobranch fishes and of Scleractinia coral assemblages in the waters of the Ogasawara Islands.

513,Eddies of the California Current System: Physical and Ecological Characteristis,"Owen, Robert",1980,,,,"This paper reviews eddies and their ecological effects in the California Current System (CCS). The importance of eddies lies in the physical properties of eddy motion and the effect on what we can identify to be systematic in flow patterns and in patterns of organism distribution. The Southern California Eddy (SC Eddy), which owes at least its character and perhaps its existence to the island and bank system off southern California, receives special attention because it is the most resolvable and ecologically significant eddy known in the CCS. Many terrestrial populations as well as littoral and planktonic marine communities may prove to be continuously or temporarily maintained by eddy processes in otherwise marginal habitats. The fate of manmade products (MacGregor 1974) and their effect on island coastal and oceanic populations are also in part determined by the flow perturbations of the CCS. Formation of eddies in the flow is of particular interest since organisms and substances in transit become rather differently distributed in space and time in gyre-like circulations. Concentra- tions of organisms and substances are maintained in eddies at higher levels and for longer periods, their trajectories are markedly different, and populations which would not otherwise interact are juxtaposed. Recirculation by eddies further affects such local environmental conditions as temperature and nutrient distribution in the water, and humidity, temperature, and cloud cover in the atmosphere. My purpose is to give examples of eddy circulation-both and stationary-and free to show that large eddies are more a rule than an exception in the CCS, particularly in the Southern California Bight (SC Bight). I wish also to support the hypothesis that eddies larger than 10 km in diameter and longer than a week’s duration have a major role in sustaining the high biological productivity which is characteristic of the inshore 200 km of the ccs .",Island (Population);,Terrestrial Biodiversity (Population);,Monitoring (Outcome);,negative,nan,0,1360,1,GAY9UFPD,journalArticle,2003,"Barré, N.; Bachy, P.",Complement to the list of the birds of New Caledonia,Alauda,,00024619 (ISSN),,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0038672025&partnerID=40&md5=08686e36ebe228a5d4ae2f144e92ed87,"Over the last five years, ten species of birds not previously known on the island have been seen, increasing the number of species/subspecies recorded in New Caledonia to about 192 taxa.

Our analysis of morphological and climatic sensitivity traits associated with population trends shows that species-specific responses to climate were most strongly linked with trends. Specifically, tiger moth species that are more abundant in warmer and wetter years are more likely to show population increases. Our study contrasts with recent findings indicating insect decline in tropical and temperate regions. These results highlight the significant role of biotic responses to climate in determining long-term population trends and suggest that future climate changes are likely to impact tropical insect communities. © 2022 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

543,Marine Soundscape Ecology,"Harris, Sydney; Radford, Craig",2014,,,,"In the face of accelerated climate change, monitoring biodiversity has become acritical task for ecologists. Habitat loss is occurring at an alarming rate both in terrestrial and marine ecosystems, resulting in endangerment and extinction of species up to 1,000 times faster than natural rates. However, traditional biodiversity measurements are logistically and financially difficult, making biodiversity monitoring a challenging obstacle to conservation efforts. In terrestrial environments, ""Soundscape Ecology"" has recently emerged as a potential solution to these problems, providing a mechanism for measuring biodiversity at various temporal and spatial scales using acoustic signatures. Several acoustic diversity indices have proven to be useful indicators of biodiversity in a variety of landscapes. Thus far, this technique has not been extended to marine environments. What isknownis that different marine habitats have distinct sound signatures both in temperate and tropical waters. For example, studies have shown that temperate reefs from within a marine reserve have a different spectral signaturecompared to reefs outside the reserve. Also, a fringing reef from a tropical island has a different spectral signature to those of the lagoon and back reefs.

In addition, we provide a list of an additional 48 taxa, 34 stygophiles and 14 troglophiles, found in the system, whose ecological status could change with detailed biological studies, which may change the number of strictly subterranean species present in the system. Indeed, at present, these numbers are provisional as they correspond to a small part of this sizeable cave system. The biodiversity of large areas of the system remains unknown as these areas have yet to be explored from the biological point of view. In addition, a large number of samples of both terrestrial and aquatic fauna are still under study by specialists. Furthermore, evidence of cryptic species within Bathynellacea (Crustacea) indicates an underestimation of biodiversity in the karstic system. Despite these limitations, the data available reveal the typical uneven distribution of subterranean aquatic fauna, and suggest that the great heterogeneity of the microhabitats in this wide and highly connected karstic extension led to the great richness of aquatic subterranean species. © 2021 by the authors.

The transformations of chemical constituents in subterranean estuaries (STEs) control the delivery of nutrient loads from coastal aquifers to the ocean. It is important to determine the processes and sources that alter nutrient concentrations at a local scale in order to estimate accurate regional and global nutrient fluxes via submarine groundwater discharge (SGD), particularly in boreal environments, where data are still very scarce. Here, the biogeochemical transformations of nitrogen (N) species were examined within the STE of a boreal microtidal sandy beach located in the Magdalen Islands (Quebec, Canada). This study revealed the vertical and horizontal distribution of nitrate (NO3−), nitrite (NO2−), ammonia (NH4+), dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) and total dissolved nitrogen (TDN) measured in beach groundwater during four spring seasons (June 2011, 2012, 2013 and 2015) when aquifer recharge was maximal after snowmelt. Inland groundwater supplied high concentrations of NOx and DON to the STE, whereas inputs from seawater infiltration were very limited. Non-conservative behaviour was observed along the groundwater flow path, leading to low NOx and high NH4+ concentrations in the discharge zone. The long transit time of groundwater within the beach (∼ 166 days), coupled with oxygen-depleted conditions and high carbon concentrations, created a favourable environment for N transformations such as heterotrophic and autotrophic denitrification and ammonium production. Biogeochemical pathways led to a shift in nitrogen species along the flow path from NOx-rich to NOx-poor groundwater. An estimate of SGD fluxes of N was determined to account for biogeochemical transformations within the STE based on a N-species inventory and Darcy's flow. Fresh inland groundwater delivered 37 mol NOx yr−1 per metre of shoreline and 63 mol DON m−1 yr−1 to the STE, and NH4+ input was negligible. Near the discharge zone, the potential export of N species was estimated around 140, 1.5 and 33 mol yr−1 per metre of shoreline for NH4+, NOx and DON respectively. In contrast to the fresh inland groundwater, the N load of beach groundwater near the discharge zone was dominated by NH4+ and DON. Our study shows the importance of tidal sands in the biogeochemical transformation of the terrestrial N pool.

We compared the predicted distribution maps to independent sightings from a subsequent island-wide aerial line transect survey, and found a close match between predicted and observed distributions.

580,UNDERPASS SYSTEMS FOR AMPHIBIANS,"Jackson, Scott",1996,,,,"The spotted salamander (Ambystoma maculatum) is found throughout the eastern United States and southeastern Canada. The life history of the spotted salamander is representative of many species of amphibians in New England. Essentially terrestrial animals, these amphibians must migrate to wetland breeding sites and, after breeding, move back into upland non-breeding habitats. In areas where roads or highways separate breeding ponds from upland, non-breeding habitat, road mortality can be a serious threat to amphibian populations. Incidences of high amphibian mortality associated with roadways have attracted the attention of the general public and has resulted in a number of amphibian tunnel projects, most of them in Europe. In 1987, North America's first salamander tunnels were constructed at a site in Amherst, Massachusetts. The tunnels were monitored during the spring migration in 1988. This study found that the tunnels were successful at moving salamanders across the road. At a minimum 75.9% of animals that reached the tunnel entrances successfully passed through them. Of the remaining 24.1%, it is not known whether these animals abandoned their migration, bypassed the fence system or passed through the tunnels on a subsequent night. As many of the salamanders appeared hesitant to enter the tunnels, an investigation was made to determine the possible cause. Preliminary results indicate that the absence of light is a factor responsible for tunnel hesitation. Future tunnels should be designed to maximize the amount of ambient light inside the tunnels. An additional concern is that amphibians typically require wet conditions for their migrations. Some mechanism must be found for allowing rain to moisten the substrate within the underpasses. More research is needed to determine whether amphibians will travel through a long culvert or underpass necessary to traverse a major highway, or whether shorter tunnels with an intermediate habitat island in the median strip would be more effective.",Island (Population);,,,negative,nan,0,1360,1,GAY9UFPD,journalArticle,2003,"Barré, N.; Bachy, P.",Complement to the list of the birds of New Caledonia,Alauda,,00024619 (ISSN),,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0038672025&partnerID=40&md5=08686e36ebe228a5d4ae2f144e92ed87,"Over the last five years, ten species of birds not previously known on the island have been seen, increasing the number of species/subspecies recorded in New Caledonia to about 192 taxa.

587,"8000 YEARS OF HUMAN SETTLEMENT AND LAND USE IN OLD RANCH CANYON, SANTA ROSA ISLAND, CALIFORNIA","Rick, Torben",2009,,,,"Abstract—Located on Santa Rosa Island’s northeast coast, Old Ranch Canyon contains abundant
 freshwater, and diverse marine and terrestrial ecosystems, including the nearby Skunk Point dune
 complex, adjacent Torrey Pine Grove, and Abalone Rocks estuary/marsh near the canyon mouth. These
 and other factors have made the area an attractive location for human settlement for much of the Holocene.
 Archaeological survey, 14C dating, and small-scale testing in the canyon and adjacent Skunk Point
 identified 67 archaeological sites, including shell middens, lithic scatters, and a large Chumash village
 complex. Radiocarbon dates demonstrate that the canyon and surrounding area were occupied for over
 8000 years, with Early, Middle, and Late Holocene occupation of the canyon mouth and hilltops/

Oceans represent 70% of the blue planet, and surprisingly, ocean emission in term of volatile organic compounds is poorly understood. The potential climate impacts on a global scale of various trace organic gases have been established, and the terrestrial inputs are well studied, but little is known about which of these can be emitted from oceanic sources. In the present study, atmospheric samples were taken over the Southern Indian Ocean, while crossing some oceanic fronts and different phytoplankton species. Such a study should aid in understanding oceanic emission, especially from phytoplankton, and will help modellers to determine concentrations of organic traces in the remote marine troposphere.

We surveyed medium and large terrestrial mammals of the Rincon Mountains within Saguaro National Park, and compared the results with previous surveys of the Rincons. We sampled in random locations in four elevational strata from May 2011 through April 2012. We detected 23 native species of mammals and estimated species richness to be 24.8 species. We failed to detect four native species documented by other methods during 1999-2012, as well as five species (bighorn sheep, grizzly bear, jaguar, gray wolf, and North American porcupine) documented during 1900-1999 that may be extirpated from the Rincons.

615,"Coral Cay Instability and Species-Turnover of Plants at Swain Reefs, Southern Great Barrier Reef, Australia","Flood, Peter; Heatwole, H.",1986,Journal of Coastal Research,,,"The coral cays of the Swain Reefs are far removed (up to 200 km) from any mainland influence. There is a complex inter-relationship between species distribution, species-turnover, and coral cay instability. Factors promoting cay instability include: (1) seasonal variation in wind direction, (2) short term cyclonic influences, and (3) longer term changes in the direction of the dominant winds. The cyclonic influence appears to be a major cause of inter-cay variations in plant species distribution. This is shown by comparing the orientation and position of the cays in 1964 with their present morphology. Gannet Cay for example only has a very small percentage of the vegetated area common to both the 1964 and 1984 cay outlines. A total of 13 species of terrestrial vascular plants have been recorded from the cays. Four species were prevalent and persistent since 1967. There was local extinction and immigration of plants which resulted in considerable species-turnover. Patterns of extinction and immigration varied among islands. In general, immigration was more prevalent early in the study and extinction more prevalent later. Unstable islands tended to have higher rates of species-turnover than did more stable ones.",Island (Population);,Terrestrial Biodiversity (Population);,,negative,nan,0,1360,1,GAY9UFPD,journalArticle,2003,"Barré, N.; Bachy, P.",Complement to the list of the birds of New Caledonia,Alauda,,00024619 (ISSN),,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0038672025&partnerID=40&md5=08686e36ebe228a5d4ae2f144e92ed87,"Over the last five years, ten species of birds not previously known on the island have been seen, increasing the number of species/subspecies recorded in New Caledonia to about 192 taxa.

Collected data were used for model-based abundance estimates of fin whales in 2 strata. The minimum average (± SE) density of fin whales was estimated at 0.0268 ± 0.0183 ind. km-2 in a 19750 km2 area around Elephant Island, resulting in a minimum abundance estimate of 528 ± 362 fin whales. In a 13550 km2 area around the South Orkney Islands, we estimated a minimum density of 0.0588 ± 0.0381 ind. km-2 and a minimum abundance of 796 ± 516 ind. The results of this study confirm a westerly extension of a recently described high-density area for fin whales in the West Antarctic Peninsula region. In the light of increasing krill fisheries in the local region, we suggest this area for further studies to assess the potential for conflict between recovering whale populations and emerging industrial interests.

631,Community structure influences species’ abundance along environmental gradients,"Eloranta, Antti; Helland, Ingeborg; Sandlund, Odd; Hesthagen, Trygve; Ugedal, Ola; Finstad, Anders",2015,Journal of Animal Ecology,https://doi.org/10.1111/1365-2656.12461,10.1111/1365-2656.12461,"Species' response to abiotic environmental variation can be influenced by local community structure and interspecific interactions, particularly in restricted habitats such as islands and lakes. In temperate lakes, future increase in water temperature and run-off of terrestrial (allochthonous) dissolved organic carbon (DOC) are predicted to alter community composition and the overall ecosystem productivity. However, little is known about how the present community structure and abiotic environmental variation interact to affect the abundance of native fish populations. We used a space-for-time approach to study how local community structure interact with lake morphometric and climatic characteristics (i.e. temperature and catchment productivity) to affect brown trout (Salmo trutta L.) yield in 283 Norwegian lakes located in different biogeographical regions. Brown trout yield (based on data from standardized survey gill net fishing; g 100 m(-2) gill net night(-1)) was generally lower in lakes where other fish species were present than in lakes with brown trout only. The yield showed an overall negative relationship with increasing temperature and a positive relationship with lake shoreline complexity. Brown trout yield was also negatively correlated with DOC load (measured using Normalized Difference Vegetation Index as a proxy) and lake size and depth (measured using terrain slope as a proxy), but only in lakes where other fish species were present.

In temperate lakes, future increase in water temperature and run-off of terrestrial (allochthonous) dissolved organic carbon (DOC) are predicted to alter community composition and the overall ecosystem productivity. However, little is known about how the present community structure and abiotic environmental variation interact to affect the abundance of native fish populations. We used a space-for-time approach to study how local community structure interact with lake morphometric and climatic characteristics (i.e. temperature and catchment productivity) to affect brown trout (Salmo trutta L.) yield in 283 Norwegian lakes located in different biogeographical regions. Brown trout yield (based on data from standardized survey gill net fishing; g 100 m-2 gill net night-1) was generally lower in lakes where other fish species were present than in lakes with brown trout only. The yield showed an overall negative relationship with increasing temperature and a positive relationship with lake shoreline complexity. Brown trout yield was also negatively correlated with DOC load (measured using Normalized Difference Vegetation Index as a proxy) and lake size and depth (measured using terrain slope as a proxy), but only in lakes where other fish species were present. The observed negative response of brown trout yield to increasing DOC load and proportion of the pelagic open-water area is likely due to restricted (littoral) niche availability and competitive dominance of more pelagic fishes such as Arctic charr (Salvelinus alpinus (L.)).

 Abstract
 This 25-y study monitored aquatic and terrestrial gamma-ray-emitting radionuclide levels near a nuclear power plant. It is the only known, long-term environmental survey of its kind. It was conducted neither by a utility owner, nor by a government agency, but rather by a private, environmental research institution. Compared to dozens of other flora and fauna, periphyton was found to be the best indicator to biomonitor the Susquehanna River, which runs near PPL Susquehanna's nuclear plant. Sampling began in 1979 before the first plant start-up and continued for the next 24 years. Monitoring began two months after the Three Mile Island accident of 28 March 1979 and includes Three Mile Island area measurements. Ongoing measurements detected fallout from Chernobyl in 1986, as well as 131I not released from PPL Susquehanna. Although this paper concentrates on radionuclides found in periphyton, the scope of the entire environmental program includes a wide variety of aquatic and land-based plants, animals, and inorganic matter. Other species and matter studied were fish, mussels, snails, crayfish, insects, humus, mushrooms, lichens, squirrels, deer, cabbage, tomatoes, coarse and flocculated sediment, and more. Results show periphyton works well for detection of radionuclide activity, even in concentrations less than 100 Bq kg−1 (picocuries per gram amounts). Data indicate that PPL Susquehanna's radionuclide releases have had no known environmental or human health impact.",Island (Population);,Terrestrial Biodiversity (Population);,,negative,10.1097/01.hp.0000228934.94734.3f,15346,2152,15347,34X4XE4Z,journalArticle,2007,"Patrick, R.; Palms, J.; Kreeger, D.; Harris, C.",Twenty-five-year study of radionuclides in the Susquehanna River via periphyton biomonitors,Health Physics,,00179078 (ISSN),10.1097/01.HP.0000228934.94734.3f,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-33845706691&doi=10.1097%2f01.HP.0000228934.94734.3f&partnerID=40&md5=0469de87145cbdfa0a38f25083042941,"This 25-y study monitored aquatic and terrestrial gamma-ray-emitting radionuclide levels near a nuclear power plant.

667,Ecological corridor construction based on target species protection:A case study of Chongming Island,"Jing-xue, NI",2009,Shengtaixue zazhi,,,"Landscape fragmentation and habitat loss are widely recognized as the major threats to the biodiversity decrease and species extinction. In order to widen wildlife' s living area, ecological corridors have been built between fragmented habitats, which can not only stimulate gene exchange, but also improve species viability in fragmented habitats. Chongming Island, as an isolated deposition sand island of Shanghai, is significantly threatened by the decrease and fragmentation of forest patches. As a result, a great number of terrestrial animals whose living depends on forest habitats are tended to be extinct. In this paper, we chose hedgehog (Erinaceus europaeus), the first class protected animal, as the target species. Based on the analysis of its living behavior and matrix' s spatial distribution, this paper adopted the least-cost model and Geographic Information System (GIS) to help finding the best corridor between the living habitats of E. europaeus.

Geothermal (acidic) hot water springs in India may reveal the presence of extremophilic unicellular red algal genera like Cyanidium, Cyanidioschyzon and Galdieria of the Cyanidiophyceae. Two maps showing the political and biogeographic zones of India are included. The need to preserve holotype and duplicate/voucher specimens with GPS data of future collections of red algal groups in a centralized national facility is also highlighted. © 2018 Magnolia Press.",2018,2025-04-16 10:23:26,2025-04-16 10:23:26,,1-48,,1,364,,Phytotaxa,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Publisher: Magnolia Press,,,,India; Estuarine; Freshwater; Bibliographic Catalog; Compsopogonophyceae; Florideophyceae; Non-Marine; Red Algae,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.004,0.001-0.012,0.004,100.00%

Little is known about the C, N and P stoichiometric ratios that exist in the soils and plants of Chenier Island in the Yellow River Delta (YRD). We examined the distribution patterns and relationships of C, N and P stoichiometry in the soils and plants of Chenier Island, as well as the potential influences of the island's micro-geomorphology. Based on a study of four soil profile categories and Phragmites australis and Suaeda heteroptera plant tissues, our results showed that micro-geomorphology could leave a distinct imprint on the soil and plant elemental stoichiometry of Chenier Island; significant variation in the atomic C:N:P ratios (RCNP) existed in soils and plants, indicating that the RCNP values in both the soil and plants are not well constrained at the Chenier Island scale.

Selected habitats in the study area (North-Sudan) have been investigated with a focus on diversity of flora, vegetation abundance, and a descriptive taxonomical study including collection, preparation and, identification. During this survey (Between 2007 and 2014) a total of 133 species of plants were identified, belonging to 42 families occupying different habitats. The islands permit the development of the highest number of plant species due to flood, sufficient moisture content and fertile soil. Riparian and arable lands in the study area are significantly rich in plant species, compared with valleys and desert habitats. The most highly represented families were the Poaceae with 17 species followed by the Mimosaceae with 11 species. A distinct zonal distribution of the plant communities was found The species were exposed to the same geographical conditions, and the environmental conditions in the area with regard to soil type and moisture are suitable for these plants The most important plant species are either major dominant species, like Desmostachya bipinnata and Rhyinchosia minima or endangered and vulnerable, e.g. Acacia nilotica and Sesbain sesban, or rare and threatened species and newly recorded for the area such as Lasiopogon muscoides.",Island (Population);,,,negative,nan,0,1360,1,GAY9UFPD,journalArticle,2003,"Barré, N.; Bachy, P.",Complement to the list of the birds of New Caledonia,Alauda,,00024619 (ISSN),,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0038672025&partnerID=40&md5=08686e36ebe228a5d4ae2f144e92ed87,"Over the last five years, ten species of birds not previously known on the island have been seen, increasing the number of species/subspecies recorded in New Caledonia to about 192 taxa.

These oceanographic perturbations coincide with significant declines in top predator populations attributed to shifts in the distribution and availability of prey, illustrating the interconnectedness between the marine and terrestrial ecosystems of the PEIs. This study investigated the influence of oceanographic variability on the marine ecosystem of the PEIs. A shift in phytoplankton and bacterial communities was observed that coincides with the position of the southern branch of the SAF, which was located to the north of the PEIs during 2014 and to the south during 2012, 2013, and 2015. These shifts in the diversity and structure of marine microbial communities correlate with significant perturbations in the position of the SAF relative to the islands leading us to conlclude that bacterial and phytoplankton communities in the PEI region are strongly influenced by shifts in the position of the SAF relative to the PEIs.

This study evaluates the temporal dynamics of a marginal terrestrial small-mammal community in an isolated Cerrado patch within the UPAF, at the southwestern distributional limit of the Cerrado and near the western limit of the UPAF in eastern Paraguay. Because the faunal members of marginal communities are living near the limits of their capabilities in terms of their abiotic and biotic environment, the communities in such areas are likely to be a mixture of Cerrado and UPAF species, sensitive to extrinsic variables such as climate change and anthropogenic changes in land use. In this 23-month study, temporal dynamics of a terrestrial small-mammal community were evaluated with respect to El Niño/Southern Oscillation, precipitation, and fire. Densities of some species were quite variable. Generally, responses to precipitation patterns became evident only several months after burning, or (on the frequently-burned grid) were not observed. Some species more characteristic of forest or second-growth vegetation were encountered only seasonally or sporadically.

Clustering of 21.6 mill sequence reads with a d value of 13 in swarm , returned about 25 K OTU reads.

Topographic heterogeneity and lateral subsurface flow at the hillslope scale of ≤1 km may have outsized impacts on tropical forest through their impacts on water available to plants under water-stressed conditions. However, vegetation dynamics and finer-scale hydrologic processes are not concurrently represented in Earth system models. In this study, we integrate the Energy Exascale Earth System Model (E3SM) land model (ELM) that includes the Functionally Assembled Terrestrial Ecosystem Simulator (FATES), with a three-dimensional hydrology model (ParFlow) to explicitly resolve hillslope topography and subsurface flow and perform numerical experiments to understand how hillslope-scale hydrologic processes modulate vegetation along water availability gradients at Barro Colorado Island (BCI), Panama. Our simulations show that groundwater table depth (WTD) can play a large role in governing aboveground biomass (AGB) when drought-induced tree mortality is triggered by hydraulic failure. Analyzing the simulations using random forest (RF) models, we find that the domain-wide simulated AGB and WTD can be well predicted by static topographic attributes, including surface elevation, slope, and convexity, and adding soil moisture or groundwater table depth as predictors further improves the RF models. Different model representations of mortality due to hydraulic failure can change the dominant topographic driver for the simulated AGB. Contrary to the simulations, the observed AGB in the well-drained 50 ha forest census plot within BCI cannot be well predicted by the RF models using topographic attributes and observed soil moisture as predictors, suggesting other factors such as nutrient status may have a larger influence on the observed AGB.

Some herbivorous insect traits, such as their spatio-temporal distribution, are especially relevant in the current scenario of global changes, which are more pronounced in high elevation areas, helping to improve the effectiveness of conservation actions. Here we evaluated the influence that different spatiotemporal scales have on three free-feeding herbivorous insect guilds (fluid-feeding, leaf-chewing, and xylophagous insects) in montane forest islands immersed in a grassland-dominated matrix ( campo rupestre ). We assessed whether species turnover or nestedness was the main component determining both spatial and temporal species composition variation (β-diversity) of the herbivorous insect community. We also checked the temporal effect on herbivorous insect guilds composition between vertical strata. We sampled herbivorous insects during two summers and two winters in 14 forest islands of different sizes and shapes in a natural mountainous fragment located in southeastern Brazil. A total of 6597 herbivorous insects representing 557 morphospecies were sampled, 290 of which were fluid-feeding, 147 leaf-chewing and 120 xylophagous insects. We found a main contribution of time scale in the organization of the herbivorous insect composition sampled in this study, mainly by turnover, with small differences among guilds.

Using video materials obtained online at one of the main island coastal rookeries of seals (on the island of Tonkyi, the archipelago of the Ushkany Islands, Lake Baikal) in 2011–2017, the dependence of the number of seals hauled out on the lake level and the peculiarities of the fishing regime was determined (the survey was conducted from May–June to October). A direct relationship was determined between the relative number of animals that had a moulting delay and the ice regime of a given year: the longer the floating ice in the northern part of Lake Baikal remained, the more numerous were the first approaches of seals to the studied rookery and the greater was the proportion of moulting individuals. It is reasonable to assume that the main reason for the Baikal seal to come ashore is not prolongued moulting time, but a physiological need for sunlight, which has a healing effect on the body of animals that lack solar radiation in winter. In general, climate warming has a negative impact on the state of the Baikal seal population.

Ecosystem-based management (EBM) in British Columbia began with the development of land use plans in the 1990s to address coastal and land use issues related to terrestrial land management. Managing marine resources is challenging on Canada's Pacific coast because of multiple, overlapping jurisdictions, unceded indigenous territories, and lack of coordination amongst governments in the region and their agencies. The Marine Plan Partnership for the North Pacific Coast (MaPP) was formed in 2011 and was a co-led partnership between 18 First Nations' and the Province of British Columbia governments. The purpose of the MaPP Initiative was to develop and implement marine plans for 102,000 square kilometers of coastal and offshore water in northern British Columbia. A co-led governance framework included the member First Nations and the Provincial government structured into multiple levels of decisions making, conflict resolution, and technical support. Integral to the planning process was broad and continual stakeholder engagement through multiple advisory committees as well as public engagement. The planning process made use of multiple information sources including traditional, scientific, and local knowledge and was completed in 3.5 years. The result was the development and signing into policy of four sub-regional marine plans (one for each of the four MaPP sub-regions: Haida Gwaii, North Coast, Central Coast, and North Vancouver Island) and a Regional Action Framework. The sub-regional plans delineate protection, special, and general management zones for multiple objectives and will inform future policy decisions for marine protected areas, tenures, resource management and coastal development through an EBM approach. The plans will inform permits for marine tenures including aquaculture, offshore renewable energy siting, contribute to Canada's marine protected areas network, and improve coastal infrastructure. The Regional Action Framework highlights activities to occur across the entire region through five main activity areas (Regional Governance, Ecological Integrity and Human Well-being, Compliance and Enforcement, Cumulative Effects Assessment, and Zoning Recommendations). Funding for planning was through a public-private model that also supported the development of the plans and decision support tools (e.g. planning and mapping portal).

Symptoms range from headache and muscle spasms in mild cases to coma and even death. Many human cases have been recorded around the world, with the majority in tropical and subtropical locations. The increase in numbers of human cases and the expansion of the geographic distribution of cases make this parasite and its hosts important research foci. Definitive hosts include various rat species such as Rattus norvegicus, R. rattus, and R. exulans, and a number of land and freshwater snails and slugs have previously been identified as intermediate hosts.1 Both definitive and intermediate hosts are obligate to the life cycle of A. cantonensis. Paratenic hosts span a wide range of fauna and are not needed in the nematode's life cycle, but act as reservoirs in which different larval stages of the parasite can persist but not develop further; they include freshwater shrimp, flatworms, and frogs.2–4 Accidental hosts, including humans and other mammals, as well as birds, permit development from the third larval stage to the subadult (fifth) stage but are then dead ends for the parasite.5,6 These hosts are infected primarily through consumption of raw or undercooked intermediate or paratenic hosts, either intentionally or accidentally via contaminated produce.7
 
 In Hawai‘i, there have been recent outbreaks with cases of infection on four of the main islands. Since there is currently a limited consensus on appropriate therapy, steps to prevent infection should be taken. The first step to facilitate this and to lay the groundwork for future management of the hosts is to identify the intermediate hosts of A. cantonensis and to determine its geographic distribution within the Hawaiian Islands. To do this over 1000 specimens of 37 terrestrial and freshwater snail and slug species (30 introduced, 7 native) from the six largest Hawaiian Islands were screened using a molecular approach.8 Total DNA was extracted from foot tissue of each specimen and was amplified using Angiostrongylus-specific primers.8 Amplicons were visualized on agarose gels to determine if specimens were positive or negative for A. cantonensis. All of the positive specimens and a random sample of all other specimens tested were also reamplified using species-specific primers.9 All positive samples were still positive with the newer primers. The parasite was present in 16 (14 alien, 2 native) of these species, from five of the six largest Hawaiian Islands. These species represent 10 phylogenetically diverse terrestrial pulmonate families and 2 more distantly related caenogastropod families (one terrestrial and one freshwater). This broad phylogenetic representation demonstrates that this parasite is not host specific, to the extent that perhaps even any snail or slug species could act as an intermediate host.",,Terrestrial Biodiversity (Population);,,negative,nan,0,1360,1,GAY9UFPD,journalArticle,2003,"Barré, N.; Bachy, P.",Complement to the list of the birds of New Caledonia,Alauda,,00024619 (ISSN),,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0038672025&partnerID=40&md5=08686e36ebe228a5d4ae2f144e92ed87,"Over the last five years, ten species of birds not previously known on the island have been seen, increasing the number of species/subspecies recorded in New Caledonia to about 192 taxa.

The aim of the present study was to examine meromictic lakes and their catchments on the far northern coast of Ellesmere Island, Nunavut, Canada, and to evaluate the results in the context of climate change. Our analyses revealed the presence of several PFCs in catchment snowpack, inflowing streams, lake water, and the aquatic food web of Lake A (83 °00′ N, 75 °30′ W), showing that dispersal of these contaminants reaches the northern limit of the terrestrial High Arctic. However, the concentrations were low (total PFCs: 27-754 pg L-1 for water, 134-848 pg L-1 for melted snow, 5-2149 pg g-1 wet weight for fish; PFOS: 66 pg g-1 dry weight in surficial sediments) and at or below values reported to date in the literature for other remote lakes. PFHpA, PFOA, and PFNA were the main compounds detected in water and melted snow, while PFNA, PFDA, and PFUnA were the predominant compounds in the aquatic biota, indicating their bioaccumulative potential. Salinity-temperature-depth profiles suggested that most of the present contaminant load enters the lake via streams and flows directly under the lake ice to the ocean.

The accessibility of large-bodied species and their characteristically high levels of genetic polymorphism make them excellent ecological and evolutionary models for studies on the phylogeography, phylogenetics, and conservation of organisms in fragmented populations. This study aims to elucidate the biodiversity, systematics, and distributions of genetic lineages within the genus Oreohelix at the northern and western periphery of their range. Results We found four mitochondrial clades, three of which are putative subspecies of Oreohelix subrudis . One clade was geographically widespread, occurring within numerous sites in Cypress Hills and in the Rocky Mountains, a second was geographically restricted to the Rocky Mountains in Alberta, and a third was restricted to the Cypress Hills region. A fourth clade was the small-bodied species, O. cooperi . ITS2 sequence and screening data revealed three genetic clusters, of which one was O. cooperi . Cluster 1 contained most individuals in COI clade X and some from clade B and cluster 2 was predominantly made up of individuals from COI clades B and B′ and a few from clade X. ITS2 alleles were shared in a narrow contact zone between two COI clades, suggestive of hybridization between the two. Conclusions A sky island known as Cypress Hills, in southeastern Alberta, Canada, is a biodiversity hotspot for terrestrial land snails in the genus Oreohelix .

A fourth clade was the small-bodied species, O. cooperi. ITS2 sequence and screening data revealed three genetic clusters, of which one was O. cooperi. Cluster 1 contained most individuals in COI clade X and some from clade B and cluster 2 was predominantly made up of individuals from COI clades B and B′ and a few from clade X. ITS2 alleles were shared in a narrow contact zone between two COI clades, suggestive of hybridization between the two. Conclusions: A sky island known as Cypress Hills, in southeastern Alberta, Canada, is a biodiversity hotspot for terrestrial land snails in the genus Oreohelix. The observed phylogeographic patterns likely reflect reproductive isolation during the Last Glacial Maximum, followed by secondary contact due to passive, long-range dispersal resulting from low vagility, local adaptation, and complex glacial history. © 2019 The Author(s).",2020,2025-04-16 11:00:26,2025-04-16 11:00:26,,,,1,20,,BMC Evol.

Field operations were carried out with three different autonomous platforms, an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV), an Autonomous Surface Vehicle (ASV) and a Lagrangian Drifter (LD), all deployed and recovered from the RV SOCIB support vessel, during a seven-day campaign in the Spanish marine and terrestrial protected area of Cabrera, Balearic Islands. Activities were designed and planned to collect video sequences in situ, from the AUV and from the LD, both navigating close to the seafloor in certain particular locations of the park colonized with the endemic seagrass species Posidonia oceanica (Po). Visual data was later composed in photo-mosaics and classified using machine learning algorithms. The joint application of all these technologies goes one step beyond the solutions already existing in the literature based on divers or remote sensing, and, in line with other solutions that apply underwater vehicles to monitor underwater ecosystems, it extends the range of operations for Po control in time, space and depth, obtaining the data in situ, eliminating risks to humans and automating the computation of several parameters that define the estate of the ecosystems.

We assess whether the current distribution of maritime Antarctic populations of the freshwater copepod Boeckella poppei is the result of (1) a post-Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) colonization, or whether (2) the species survived in regional glacial refugia throughout the LGM and earlier glaciations. Using 438 specimens from 34 different sampling sites across Southern South America, South Georgia, South Orkney Islands, South Shetland Islands, and the Antarctic Peninsula, we analyzed mitochondrial and nuclear sequences to uncover patterns of genetic diversity and population structure. We also performed median-joining haplotype network, phylogenetic reconstruction, and divergence time analyses. Finally, we evaluated past demographic changes and historical scenarios using the Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) method. Our data support the existence of two clades with different and contrasting biogeographic histories. The first clade has been present in maritime Antarctica since at least the mid-Pleistocene, with the South Orkney Islands the most likely refugial area. The second clade has a broader distribution including southern South America, South Georgia, South Shetland Islands, and the Antarctic Peninsula.

Re-colonization of ice-impacted Antarctic areas would have occurred following a LDD and Establishment model, pointing to the existence of possible post-dispersal barriers, despite widely assumed high passive dispersal capacity in freshwater invertebrates.",2022,2025-04-16 11:27:42,2025-04-16 11:27:42,,,,,10,,Front. ecol. evol.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Publisher: Frontiers Media S.A.,,,,phylogeography; last glacial maximum; refugia; DISPERSAL; Antarctic-Magellan connection; centropagidae; monopolization hypothesis; SOUTHERN-OCEAN; POPULATION-GENETICS; SIGNY ISLAND; EAST ANTARCTICA; LARSEMANN HILLS; EVOLUTIONARY; LAST GLACIAL MAXIMUM; ENVIRONMENTAL-CHANGES; RESTING EGGS,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.0044,0.001-0.009,0.003,100.00%

Oczkowski1,2,*, Michael E. Q. Pilson1, Scott W. Nixon1 1Graduate School of Oceanography, University of Rhode Island, Narragansett, Rhode Island 02882, USA 2Present address: United States Environmental Protection Agency, Atlantic Ecology Division, Narragansett, Rhode Island 02882, USA *Email: oczkowski.autumn@epa.gov ABSTRACT: Although stable isotopes of organic carbon (δ13C) are typically used as indicators of terrestrial, intertidal, and offshore organic carbon sources to coastal ecosystems, there is evidence that δ13C values are also sensitive to in situ ecosystem metabolism. To investigate this phenomenon, we examined δ13C values of filter-feeding hard clams Mercenaria mercenaria from 13 locations in Greenwich Bay, a sub-estuary of Narragansett Bay, Rhode Island (USA). The δ13C values of the clams showed a marked linear gradient of 2‰ over the 4 km length of Greenwich Bay (–19 to –17‰), from lower δ13C values in the inner bay to higher values at the mouth, where Greenwich Bay joins Narragansett Bay proper (R2 = 0.94, p < 0.0001). This is in contrast to previous work that has shown that δ13C values of clams in Narragansett Bay proper (over 40 km long) are homogenous (mean ± SD, –16.8 ± 0.6 ‰, n = 247). Mean daily pH, temperature, and salinity data from 2 fixed monitoring stations were used to estimate aqueous CO2 (CO2(aq)) concentrations in the surrounding water. CO2(aq) concentrations were higher in inner Greenwich Bay than immediately outside of the bay, suggesting that the dissolved inorganic carbon sources supporting phytoplankton production are quite different across the bay. The outer Greenwich Bay clams appear to feed on Narragansett Bay phytoplankton with higher δ13C values that are grown in a higher pH, more bicarbonate-rich environment. In contrast, the inner Greenwich Bay clams may feed on phytoplankton grown in lower pH water with a greater availability of CO2(aq). The lower δ13C of CO2(aq) relative to HCO3– is reflected in the phytoplankton and in the clams that feed on them. Our work suggests that δ13C values may be sensitive to changes in inorganic C in estuarine systems, which may confound attempts to use stable isotopes to identify organic carbon sources.

Here, we focus on an important form of demographic stochasticity: variation in litter sizes.

Since data on intraspecific litter size variation are often sparse, it is unclear what probability distribution should be used to describe the pattern of litter size variation for multiparous carnivores. Methodology/Principal Findings We used litter size data on 32 terrestrial carnivore species to test the fit of 12 probability distributions. The influence of these distributions on quasi-extinction probabilities and the probability of successful disease control was then examined for three canid species – the island fox Urocyon littoralis, the red fox Vulpes vulpes, and the African wild dog Lycaon pictus. Best fitting probability distributions differed among the carnivores examined. However, the discretised normal distribution provided the best fit for the majority of species, because variation among litter-sizes was often small.

It is influenced by alterations in meteorological conditions at micro- and mesoscale in cities as a result of urbanisation and the intensification of anthropogenic activities. One example is the urban heat island (UHI), i.e. the increase in temperature in city cores compared to their surroundings. In this study, we used plant phenological data from the High-Resolution Vegetation Phenology and Productivity dataset of the Copernicus Land Monitoring Service to explore the relationship between urbanisation intensity (i.e., proportion of built-up area) and the phenology and productivity of broadleaf deciduous and evergreen coniferous trees in the city of Madrid and its surroundings, one of the largest metropolitan areas in Europe. We found the average start of season date advanced by 0.79–11.79 days in broadleaf deciduous trees in highly urbanised areas, and was delayed by 5.77–9.16 days in evergreen coniferous trees. Although differences were also observed for the end and length of the growing season, these patterns showed great interannual variability. Both broadleaf deciduous and evergreen coniferous trees were most productive in highly urbanised areas. Although previous studies have explored the response of different land-cover types to urbanisation, to our knowledge, none have looked at this relationship at a fine spatial scale in a Mediterranean city with different vegetation functional groups.

One example is the urban heat island (UHI), i.e. the increase in temperature in city cores compared to their surroundings. In this study, we used plant phenological data from the High-Resolution Vegetation Phenology and Productivity dataset of the Copernicus Land Monitoring Service to explore the relationship between urbanisation intensity (i.e., proportion of built-up area) and the phenology and productivity of broadleaf deciduous and evergreen coniferous trees in the city of Madrid and its surroundings, one of the largest metropolitan areas in Europe. We found the average start of season date advanced by 0.79–11.79 days in broadleaf deciduous trees in highly urbanised areas, and was delayed by 5.77–9.16 days in evergreen coniferous trees. Although differences were also observed for the end and length of the growing season, these patterns showed great interannual variability. Both broadleaf deciduous and evergreen coniferous trees were most productive in highly urbanised areas. Although previous studies have explored the response of different land-cover types to urbanisation, to our knowledge, none have looked at this relationship at a fine spatial scale in a Mediterranean city with different vegetation functional groups. The analysis of more specific classes of vegetation enables a better understanding of the phenological response of vegetation to urbanisation intensity. © 2023 The Author(s)",2023,2025-04-16 11:10:15,2025-04-16 11:10:15,,,,,235,,Landsc.

Marine resource usage in the Rottnest Island Reserve, Western Australia","Beckley, L.E.",2003,,,,"Rottnest Island, located off the coast of Perth, has iconic status as a recreation destination for Western Australians. Although the island and surrounding waters (within 800m) have legal standing as the Rottnest Island Reserve, the conservation status remains somewhat enigmatic with terrestrial fauna and flora fully protected but the marine biota only subject to standard WA fisheries regulations. Half a million people visit the island annually and a large proportion of visitors engage in extractive or non-extractive marine resource usage. A multi-facetted study to investigate usage patterns (fishing, boating, diving, surfing etc) is underway. Results from an on-site questionnaire survey of shore anglers are presented here. The survey was conducted on weekends over a 12-month period in 2002/2003 and anglers were intercepted and interviewed while fishing around the island. Results on demographics of the shore anglers, frequency and patterns of use, socio-economic indicators (residential suburb, travel estimators and direct expenditure on bait and equipment) and actual catch are presented.

Vegetation plays a key role in the global carbon cycle and thus is an important component within Earth system models (ESMs) that project future climate. Many ESMs are adopting methods to resolve plant size and ecosystem disturbance history, using vegetation demographic models. These models make it feasible to conduct more realistic simulation of processes that control vegetation dynamics. Meanwhile, increasing understanding of the processes governing plant water use, and ecosystem responses to drought in particular, has led to the adoption of dynamic plant water transport (i.e., hydrodynamic) schemes within ESMs. However, the extent to which variations in plant hydraulic traits affect both plant water stress and the risk of mortality in trait-diverse tropical forests is understudied. In this study, we report on a sensitivity analysis of an existing hydrodynamic scheme (HYDRO) model that is updated and incorporated into the Functionally Assembled Terrestrial Ecosystem Simulator (FATES) (FATES–HYDRO V1.0). The size- and canopy-structured representation within FATES is able to simulate how plant size and hydraulic traits affect vegetation dynamics and carbon–water fluxes. To better understand this new model system, and its functionality in tropical forest systems in particular, we conducted a global parameter sensitivity analysis at Barro Colorado Island, Panama. We assembled 942 observations of plant hydraulic traits on 306 tropical plant species for stomata, leaves, stems, and roots and determined the best-fit statistical distribution for each trait, which was used in model parameter sampling to assess the parametric sensitivity. We showed that, for simulated leaf water potential and loss of hydraulic conductivity across different plant organs, the four most important traits were associated with xylem conduit taper (buffers increasing hydraulic resistance with tree height), stomatal sensitivity to leaf water potential, maximum stem hydraulic conductivity, and the partitioning of total hydraulic resistance above vs. belowground. Our analysis of individual ensemble members revealed that trees at a high risk of hydraulic failure and potential tree mortality generally have a lower conduit taper, lower maximum xylem conductivity, lower stomatal sensitivity to leaf water potential, and lower resistance to xylem embolism for stem and transporting roots.

Here, we examined the relationship between functional connectivity (gene flow) and structural connectivity (area and spatial configuration of habitats) in three co‐occurring short‐range plant taxa in an ancient terrestrial island system. Location Low‐altitude mountain range south‐western Australia. Methods We analysed spatial patterns of genetic differentiation at nuclear microsatellite loci using Bayesian clustering. Circuit theory modelling was used to generate all possible pathways that connect populations as resistance distance matrices based on two surfaces for each taxon. The first surface assumes a flat terrain and tests whether genetic similarity declines only with distance—isolation by distance (IBD). The second surface is habitat suitability based on species distribution modelling (SDM), which tests whether genetic similarity is a function of connected and suitable habitat. Multiple matrix regression with randomization was used to test the significance of the resistance distance matrices at predicting two metrics of genetic differentiation ( F ST and D EST ). Variance explained was partitioned using redundancy analysis. Results Genetic structure for the insect‐pollinated taxa— Acacia adinophylla— and Tetratheca aphylla subsp. aphylla was at similar spatial scales. Unexpectedly, a higher level of genetic structure was found in the wind‐pollinated Lepidosperma bungalbin . IBD best explained the gene flow of A. adinophylla ( R 2 = 0.41–0.43) with partial support provided by habitat suitability ( R 2 = 0.04–0.07). In contrast, connectivity by habitat suitability was highest for T. aphylla subsp. aphylla ( R 2 = 0.56–0.59). Drivers of L. bungalbin connectivity were inconsistent between the two measures of genetic differentiation. Main conclusions Gene flow is facilitated by different factors for the three taxa.

The first surface assumes a flat terrain and tests whether genetic similarity declines only with distance—isolation by distance (IBD). The second surface is habitat suitability based on species distribution modelling (SDM), which tests whether genetic similarity is a function of connected and suitable habitat. Multiple matrix regression with randomization was used to test the significance of the resistance distance matrices at predicting two metrics of genetic differentiation (FST and DEST). Variance explained was partitioned using redundancy analysis. Results: Genetic structure for the insect-pollinated taxa—Acacia adinophylla—and Tetratheca aphylla subsp. aphylla was at similar spatial scales. Unexpectedly, a higher level of genetic structure was found in the wind-pollinated Lepidosperma bungalbin. IBD best explained the gene flow of A. adinophylla (R2 = 0.41–0.43) with partial support provided by habitat suitability (R2 = 0.04–0.07). In contrast, connectivity by habitat suitability was highest for T. aphylla subsp. aphylla (R2 = 0.56–0.59). Drivers of L. bungalbin connectivity were inconsistent between the two measures of genetic differentiation. Main conclusions: Gene flow is facilitated by different factors for the three taxa. Habitat fragmentation would most strongly impede gene flow for T. aphylla subsp. aphylla. Geographical distance cannot be assumed as the sole or best determinant of gene flow among populations, nor can findings be generalized to coexisting taxa. © 2019 The Authors.

Studies on the diversification of aquatic subterranean organisms in these habitats generally support the ‘subterranean island’ hypothesis, whereby isolated subterranean refuges lead to patterns of short‐range endemism. However, their terrestrial counterparts have received less attention. We aimed to elucidate the applicability of the ‘subterranean island’ hypothesis to terrestrial subterranean fauna through genetic analyses of two widespread troglomorphic cockroach species. To investigate the influence of subterranean biogeography, we also analysed a closely related species that inhabits ‘classic’ cave environments to represent a contrasting biogeographic comparison. Location Pilbara region, Western Australia, and the Chillagoe‐Mungana Caves, Queensland (Australia). Taxa Cave cockroach species: Nocticola cockingi , Nocticola quartermainei and Nocticola australiensis. Methods We used DArTseq to generate genome‐wide SNPs in 78 samples, and Sanger sequencing to generate 16S mtDNA data. We then applied various population genomic analyses to characterize the distribution of genetic diversity within the three study species. Results We identified distinct genetic clusters within the two Pilbara species; however, there appeared to be a notable lack of discernible population differentiation across large parts of their range (&gt;135 km), opposing the subterranean island hypothesis.

Their presence delimitates areas with microendemic species (AMs), denoting a spatial unit comprising at least one population of at least one microendemic species. AMs are assumed to be distributed distinctively and associated with specific ecological, historical, and anthropogenic attributes. However, the level of influence of these factors remains unclear. Thus, we studied the distribution patterns of microendemic species within the Brazilian Atlantic Forest to (a) identify the region’s AMs; (b) evaluate whether ecological (latitude, altitude, distance from the coastline), historical (climate stability), and anthropogenic (ecological integrity) attributes distinguish AMs from non-AMs; and (c) assess the conservation status of the Atlantic Forest’s AMs. Methods We mapped the ranges of 1,362 microendemic species of angiosperms, freshwater fishes, and terrestrial vertebrates (snakes, passerine birds, and small mammals) to identify the region’s AMs. Further, spatial autoregressive logit regression models were used to evaluate whether latitude, altitude, distance from the coastline, Climate Stability Index, and ecological integrity can be used to discern AMs from non-AMs. Moreover, the AMs’ conservation status was assessed by evaluating the region’s ecological integrity and conservation efforts (measured as the proportion of AMs in protected areas). Results We identified 261 AMs for angiosperm, 205 AMs for freshwater fishes, and 102 AMs for terrestrial vertebrates in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest, totaling 474 AMs covering 23.8% of the region. The Brazilian Atlantic Forest is a large and complex biogeographic mosaic where AMs represent islands or archipelagoes surrounded by transition areas with no microendemic species. All local attributes help to distinguish AMs from non-AMs, but their impacts vary across taxonomic groups.

Battery energy storage systems provide power during peak times, alleviating grid stress and reducing the necessity for grid upgrades. By 2030, one of the proposed capacity development scenarios on the island involves deploying large-scale lithium-ion batteries to better manage the integration of solar generation. This paper focuses on the life cycle assessment and life cycle costing of a lithium iron phosphate large-scale battery energy storage system in Lombok to evaluate the environmental and economic impacts of this battery development scenario. This analysis considers a cradle-to-grave model and defines 10 environmental and 4 economic midpoint indicators to assess the impact of battery energy storage system integration with Lombok’s grid across manufacturing, operation, and recycling processes. From a life cycle assessment perspective, the operation subsystem contributes most significantly to global warming, while battery manufacturing is responsible for acidification, photochemical ozone formation, human toxicity, and impacts on marine and terrestrial ecosystems. Recycling processes notably affect freshwater due to their release of 4.69 × 10−4 kg of lithium. The life cycle costing results indicate that over 85% of total costs are associated with annualized capital costs at a 5% discount rate. The levelized cost of lithium iron phosphate batteries for Lombok is approximately 0.0066, demonstrating that lithium-ion batteries are an economically viable option for Lombok’s 2030 capacity development scenario.

Both saltmarsh and mangrove forest are important carbon sinks, and provide unique habitats for fish and many terrestrial species. Saltmarsh is particularly critical as roosting habitat for shorebirds, and a decline in saltmarsh habitat, in part due to mangrove encroachment associated with changing estuary water levels, has been observed in the estuary. The present research aimed at establishing the effects of flow manipulation in Area E of Kooragang Island, an important roosting site that has been subject to tidal reinstatement in 1995. We analysed accretion rates, carbon capture and vegetation distribution evolution as a result of these changes in order to support ongoing restoration efforts on the site. The methodology consisted of a combination of field data collection, laboratory experiments, statistical analysis and numerical hydrodynamic simulation. Results show that tidal reinstatement resulted in general increased accretion and carbon sequestration rates, and a continuous encroachment of mangrove into saltmarsh areas. Based on these results, a mangrove exclusion program through tidal hydraulic manipulation at the wetland inlet has been proposed.",Island (Population);,,,negative,nan,0,1360,1,GAY9UFPD,journalArticle,2003,"Barré, N.; Bachy, P.",Complement to the list of the birds of New Caledonia,Alauda,,00024619 (ISSN),,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0038672025&partnerID=40&md5=08686e36ebe228a5d4ae2f144e92ed87,"Over the last five years, ten species of birds not previously known on the island have been seen, increasing the number of species/subspecies recorded in New Caledonia to about 192 taxa.
