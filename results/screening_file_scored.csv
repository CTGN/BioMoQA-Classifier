",,,,"The vegetation, soil chemistry characteristics and altitudinal distributions of 23 habitats in 7 habitat complexes on sub-Antarctic Marion Island (47°S, 38°E) are described. The habitat complexes (number of habitats in complex) are; Coastal Salt-spray Complex (2); Fellfield Complex (2); Slope Complex (6); Biotic Grassland Complex (3); Biotic Herbfield Complex (3); Mire Complex (6); Polar Desert Complex (1). The habitat classification closely reflects the between-habitat variation in the relative magnitudes of the main forcing variables that determine ecological succession on the island (moisture, exposure, parent soil material, saltspray and manuring and trampling by seals and seabirds). Hence, it can serve as a framework against which to detect and evaluate ecological responses to the marked climatic change currently occurring in the sub-Antarctic. Suggestions are made on how the habitats might respond to climatic change (warming, drying) and other perturbations (increasing or decreasing influences of salt-spray and manuring).

",,,,"This first general inventory of Reunion's terrestrial Heteroptera was built in two steps. First, current knowledge was assessed and 108 species were reported as present in Reunion. Secondly, a morpho-species based identification method allowed the compilation of an overview of the actual diversity of the terrestrial Heteroptera fauna on Reunion including undescribed species and an estimate of the proportion in the different families. Over a period of eight years this method allowed a general approach at a community level over most of the island. Sampling took into account the large diversity of Reunion's vegetation and unique habitats. The analysis found 144 morpho-species and 15 species, and new identifications of one suborder, one family, two subfamilies, four tribes and 10 genera indicating a minimum of 18 new species. Based on current knowledge and the new identified taxa, a minimum of 126 species in 25 families are present on Reunion. Specifically, Reunion's terrestrial Heteroptera fauna is characterized by a very large proportion of Anthocoridae and Rhyparochromidae, a large proportion of Alydidae and a small proportion of Pentatomoidea. This article also reports the large number of undescribed species in Reunion, while previous studies led to the description of 11 endemic species of Reduviidae, Aradidae, Cydnidae, Tingidae, Largidae and Anthocoridae. Finally, a voucher collection (ie a reference set of morpho-species) has been assembled as stepping stones to a better understanding of the undescribed part of the Reunion's terrestrial Heteroptera fauna.","0037-9271

",,"Wiley
",,,,"The tiny island of South Bimini contains 4 species of lizards of he genus Anolis, a number surpassed only on the 4 largest islands of the Greater Antilles and on 2 very large and nearby satellite islands. These species are syntopic with respect to a two—dimensional area of the ground but divide the habitat according to perch height and perch diameter: sagrei is partly terrestrial but occurs more often on small and large low perches; distichus prefers the trunks and large branches of medium to large trees; angusticipes inhabits small twigs, especially at great heights; and carolinensis is found mostly on leaves or on the adjacent twigs and brances. The size classes of the species are staggered in such a way that the interspecific classes which overlap most in habitat overlap least in prey size. Similarities in prey size and prey taxa for classes of the same species are somewhat greater than those expected on the basis of habitat and morphology alone. The distribution of the species among the vegetation communities of Bimini can be explained on the basis of perch height and diameter preference. Within the same species, the larger lizards usually eat larger food, fewer items, and in sagrei more fruit; and they have a greater average range of food size per digestive tract. One species (distichus) is extremely myrmecophagous: about 75—90% of its food items are ants. In 3 of the 4 species, subadult males take more food and average smaller prey then females of the same head length. That species (distichus) which takes the smallest food items and whose classes overlap the most in habitat preference with those of other species is least dimorphic is size between the sexes. It is suggested that such small, nondimorphic species are best suited for insinuation into complex faunas, whereas larger, dimorphic forms are best for the colonization of empty areas. The usefulness of various measures of overlap and specialization is evaluated for this lizard association.","0012-9658

","Case, Judd",,,,,2006.0,,,177,186,,,,,,258,1,"Geological Society London Special Publications
",,"Geological Society of London
",,,,"The Middle Eocene Antarctic terrestrial vertebrate palaeofauna from the La Meseta Formation on Seymour Island (= Isla Marambio), Antarctic Peninsula has a U-shaped, bimodal distribution of body sizes. This palaeofauna includes a wide range of body sizes from small insectivorous, omnivorous and granivorous marsupials, a rodent-like non-therian gondwanathere, large-sized ungulates, a sloth and cursorial birds (a ratite and a phororachoid). Medium-sized, homeothermic animals in the size range represented by rabbit to small ungulate-sized animals have not been found.
For comparison, the Early Eocene Casamayoran (Vacan ‘subage’) mammalian palaeofauna from Patagonia has a reasonably normal distribution of body sizes, with the modal class represented by medium-sized mammals, a distribution that is the direct opposite of the Antarctic palaeofauna. A comparison of the Middle Eocene Antarctic palaeofauna from the La Meseta Formation to the early Eocene Vacan-aged mammal palaeofauna is appropriate, due to the taxonomic affinities of the Antarctic palaeofauna to Riochican (latest Palaeocene) and Vacan-aged palaeofaunas of Patagonia. If these Patagonian mammalian palaeofaunas (PMP) were the source for the La Meseta palaeofauna (LMP), then a similar normal distribution with less taxonomic diversity would be expected. However, the LMP does not meet this expectation or even a distribution where all size classes are equally represented. Thus, the pattern of size distribution is quite different from the PMPs.
Floral data for the Early Eocene of Patagonia indicate subtropical conditions with mean annual temperatures (MAT) of 15.6 °C and equable winter temperatures (>10 °C) generating high taxonomic diversity at the species level. Floral data from the La Meseta Formation of equivalent age to the mammalian fauna indicate a cooler MAT of 11–13 °C with a highly seasonal climate, where the mean winter temperature could have ranged from −3 to 2 °C. There is also a significant drop in floral taxonomic diversity, which is dominated by Nothofagus.
A bimodal body size distribution pattern is not an unusual pattern for higher latitude mammalian faunas. Modern boreal mammalian faunas of North America have a low frequency of species in the medium body size range in response to cold winter temperatures in these higher latitudes. The smaller-sized mammals have adapted their physiology to the cold winter temperatures. The larger animals have adapted to the cold winter conditions by conserving heat through small surface-area-to-volume ratios as a result of their greater bulk. The low frequency of medium-sized animals is due to the fact that neither of these thermal strategies is available to them and thus they are at a selective disadvantage.","0305-8719

As a result, the avifauna has remained remarkably consistent, although with some species turnover that reflects changes in the wider regional landscape, and some notable native species additions. Pacific rats were abundant across the island, and as a result reptiles are depauperate due to local extinctions. Bell frogs and Argentine ants are both recent arrivals on the island.

Among native species, we documented several new state records, which expanded known ranges considerably in a few cases. Statistical estimates of absolute species richness for several representative taxa indicated that less-diverse groups (e.g., millipedes) were sampled almost completely by our methods, but additional sampling is needed to thoroughly inventory more-diverse taxa (e.g., ground beetles).

these large continental islands are approximately 70 kilometres from the mainland and are

habitat, relatively undisturbed by European settlement and the effects of introduced plants and
animals.
This report presents the results of a two week field survey (3-17 October 1996) of wildlife in
freshwater ecosystems on Melville Island. At the initial planning stage of the project it was
intended to carry out surveys of freshwater ecosystems on both Islands, however, a funding
reduction restricted field work to the larger Melville Island only. Conducted in collaboration with
Aboriginal custodians, the survey aimed to assess wildlife associated with freshwater ecosystems,
including the fauna occurring in the various terrestrial habitats bordering the creeks and streams on
Melville Island. Results of the survey contribute to the assessment, conservation, documentation
and management of the Tiwi Islands’ natural values, and also provide baseline data for the
determination of faunal distributional patterns. Voucher specimens of most species recorded are
lodged in the scientific reference collections of the Museum and Art Gallery of the Northern
Territory (NTM).
From the targeted faunal groups, the survey recorded 187 species on Melville Island. These were
composed of 80+ aquatic insects, 49 fishes, 10 amphibians, 31 reptiles and 17 mammals. Results of
particular interest include that 26 species of aquatic insects were either new or could not be
identified to species with certainty. An as yet undescribed odonate (dragonfly) is the first record for
the genus Huonia in Australia. The freshwater fish survey determined that the two drainage
systems on the island (north and south) support different fish faunas, and terapontids (grunters)
common elsewhere in the Northern Territory, appear to be absent from the Island. The terrestrial
vertebrate survey recorded the Fawn Antechinus (a mouse-like marsupial) from the Tiwi Islands

By assessing the extent of the distribution of threatened species across all A ustralian cities, we aim to investigate the currently under‐utilized opportunity that cities present for national biodiversity conservation. Location A ustralian mainland, T asmania and offshore islands. Methods Distributions of A ustralia's 1643 legally protected terrestrial species (hereafter ‘threatened species’) were compiled. We assessed the extent to which they overlapped with 99 cities (of more than 10,000 people), with all non‐urban areas, and with simulated ‘dummy’ cities which covered the same area and bioregion as the true cities but were non‐urban. We analysed differences between animals and plants, and examined variability within these groups using species accumulation modelling. Threatened species richness of true versus dummy cities was analysed using generalized linear mixed‐effects models. Results A ustralian cities support substantially more nationally threatened animal and plant species than all other non‐urban areas on a unit‐area basis. Thirty per cent of threatened species were found to occur in cities. Distribution patterns differed between plants and animals: individual threatened plant species were generally found in fewer cities than threatened animal species, yet plants were more likely to have a greater proportion of their distribution in urban areas than animals. Individual cities tended to contain unique suites of threatened species, especially threatened plants. The analysis of true versus dummy cities demonstrated that, even after accounting for factors such as net primary productivity and distance to the coast, cities still consistently supported a greater number of threatened species. Main conclusions This research highlights that A ustralian cities are important for the conservation of threatened species, and that the species assemblages of individual cities are relatively distinct. National conservation policy should recognize that cities play an integral role when planning for and managing threatened species.

MethodsThe list of the living and Quaternary mammalian fauna of Japan and its geographical distribution was compiled from various published works. Introduced species, marine mammals and bats were not considered in this study. Simpson and Jaccard indices were used to quantify the similarities between the fauna from twelve selected islands from the Japanese archipelago. Regression lines and Pearson correlation coefficients were used to describe the relations between species richness and various geographical factors of the islands, such as area or descriptors of isolation. Lastly, we used the method proposed by Atmar & Patterson (1993) to measure the degree of nestedness of the Japanese terrestrial mammalian fauna.

ResultsSpecies richness on islands is highly correlated with island size. However, this study reveals the importance of non-equilibrium effects. At a large scale, the current distribution of mammals in Japan seems to be due to selective post-glacial extinction processes. A large proportion of the Japanese mammals are endemic forms, and extinctions were not balanced by the colonization of species from the Asiatic mainland. In addition, we show the major role played by inter-island dispersal processes, in particular from larger islands towards smaller ones, that are mainly effected by the presence of deep marine channels between islands.

Main conclusionsThe present distribution of the terrestrial mammalian fauna from Japan is thus mainly the result of post-glacial extinctions that were not compensated for by colonization of new species from the faunal Asiatic mainland source pool. However, this study emphasizes the importance of inter-island dispersal processes.","0305-0270

",,,,"The Society for Ecological Restoration (SER) is an international non-profit organization with members in 70 countries. SER advances the science, practice and policy of ecological restoration to sustain biodiversity, improve resilience in a changing climate, and re-establish an ecologically healthy relationship between nature and culture. SER is a dynamic global network, linking researchers, practitioners, land managers, community leaders and decision-makers to restore ecosystems and the human communities that depend on them. Via its members, publications, conferences, policy work, and outreach, SER defines and delivers excellence in the field of ecological restoration. Document development. International Principles and Standards for the Practice of Ecological Restoration (the Standards) was developed through consultation with professionals within the Society for Ecological Restoration and their peers in the global scientific and conservation communities. The first edition was launched in 2016 at the United Nations Biodiversity Conference in Cancún, Mexico. This event brought together key stakeholders from across the international policy arena, many of whom had been instrumental in driving the global initiatives to implement large-scale environmental restoration programs. Because the Standards were written as a living document to be modified and expanded through consultation and use by stakeholders, the launch included an open invitation for stakeholder input, to both improve the document and promote broad use. Subsequently, over a multi-year consultation period, SER invited input and review from a diverse spectrum of people and organizations contributing to ecological restoration. Key stakeholders contacted for comment included the secretariats of the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD) including its Science-Policy Interface, Global Environment Facility, the World Bank, and members of the Global Partnership on Forest Landscape Restoration (GPFLR). In 2017, SER partnered with the IUCN Commission on Ecosystem Management to deliver an invited Forum on Biodiversity and Global Forest Restoration at which the SER Standards were reviewed (SER and IUCN-CEM 2018). SER also organized a symposium on the SER Standards and an open Knowledge Café at the 2017 SER World Conference on Ecological Restoration. Additional input was received at other events, including the 9th Ecosystem Services Partnership World Conference in Shenzhen, China in 2017. To capture the perspectives of the SER community, SER invited online feedback via its website and sent an online survey to SER members, affiliates, and stakeholders. SER has also considered and responded to feedback from published critiques in its journal, Restoration Ecology. All comments received during the consultative review process were considered in the revision process. The second edition of the Standards was approved by the SER Science and Policy Committee, and the SER Board of Directors on 18 June 2019. As with the first edition, this version will be revised and improved as the discipline evolves through science, practice, and adaptive management. The Standards are compatible with and expand on the Open Standards for the Practice of Conservation (Conservation Measures Partnership 2013) and complement the REDD+ Social and Environmental Standards (REDD+ SES 2012), and other conservation standards and guidelines.

Ecological restoration, when implemented effectively and sustainably, contributes to protecting biodiversity; improving human health and wellbeing; increasing food and water security; delivering goods, services, and economic prosperity; and supporting climate change mitigation, resilience, and adaptation. It is a solutions-based approach that engages communities, scientists, policymakers, and land managers to repair ecological damage and rebuild a healthier relationship between people and the rest of nature. When combined with conservation and sustainable use, ecological restoration is the link needed to move local, regional, and global environmental conditions from a state of continued degradation, to one of net positive improvement. The second edition of the International Principles and Standards for the Practice of Ecological Restoration (the Standards) presents a robust framework for restoration projects to achieve intended goals, while addressing challenges including effective design and implementation, accounting for complex ecosystem dynamics (especially in the context of climate change), and navigating trade-offs associated with land management priorities and decisions. The Standards establish eight principles that underpin ecological restoration. Principles 1 and 2 articulate important foundations that guide ecological restoration: effectively engaging a wide range of stakeholders, and fully utilizing available scientific, traditional, and local knowledge, respectively. Principles 3 and 4 summarize the central approach to ecological restoration, by highlighting ecologically appropriate reference ecosystems as the target of restoration and clarifying the imperative for restoration activities to support ecosystem recovery processes. Principle 5 underscores the use of measurable indicators to assess progress toward restoration objectives. Principle 6 lays out the mandate for ecological restoration to seek the highest attainable recovery. Tools are provided to identify the levels of recovery aspired to and to track progress. Principle 7 highlights the importance of restoration at large spatial scales for cumulative gains. Finally, ecological restoration is one of several approaches that address damage to ecosystems and Principle 8 clarifies its relationships to allied approaches on a ""Restorative Continuum"". The Standards highlight the role of ecological restoration in connecting social, community, productivity, and sustainability goals. The Standards also provide recommended performance measures for restorative activities for industries, communities, and governments to consider. In addition, the Standards enhance the list of practices and actions that guide practitioners in planning, implementation, and monitoring activities. The leading practices and guidance include discussion on appropriate approaches to site assessment and identification of reference ecosystems, different restoration approaches including natural regeneration, consideration of genetic diversity under climate change, and the role of ecological restoration in global restoration initiatives. This edition also includes an expanded glossary of restoration terminology. SER and its international partners produced the Standards for adoption by communities, industries, governments, educators, and land managers to improve ecological restoration practice across all sectors and in all ecosystems, terrestrial and aquatic. The Standards support development of ecological restoration plans, contracts, consent conditions, and monitoring and auditing criteria. Generic in nature, the Standards framework can be adapted to particular ecosystems, biomes, or landscapes; individual countries; or traditional cultures. The Standards are aspirational and provide tools that are intended to improve outcomes, promote best practices, and deliver net global environmental and social benefits. As the world enters the UN Decade on Ecosystem Restoration (2021–2030), the Standards provide a blueprint for ensuring ecological restoration achieves its full potential in delivering social and environmental equity and, ultimately, economic benefits and outcomes.

BLANK PROJECT EVALUATION TEMPLATES (FOR PRACTITIONER USE)45 The International Principles and Standards for the Practice of Ecological Restoration (the Standards) provide a guide to practitioners, operational personnel, students, planners, managers, regulators, policymakers, funders, and implementing agencies involved in restoring degraded ecosystems across the world—whether terrestrial, freshwater, coastal, or marine. They place ecological restoration into a global context, including its role in recovering biodiversity and improving human wellbeing11 Terms in boldface are defined in the Glossary section. in times of rapid global change. Humanity recognizes the planet's native ecosystems as having irreplaceable ecological, societal, and economic value. In addition to their intrinsic value, such as biodiversity and spiritual or aesthetic importance, healthy native ecosystems assure the flow of ecosystem services. These services include: provision of clean water and air, healthy soils, culturally important artifacts, and the food, fiber, fuel, and medicines essential for human health, wellbeing, and livelihoods. Native ecosystems can also reduce the effects of natural disasters and mitigate accelerated climate change. Ecosystem degradation, damage, and destruction (hereafter, collectively referred to as degradation) diminish the biodiversity, functioning, and resilience of ecosystems, which in turn negatively affects the resilience and sustainability of social–ecological systems. Although protecting remaining native ecosystems is critical to conserving the world's natural and cultural heritage, protection alone is insufficient, given past and current degradation. To respond to current global environmental challenges and to sustain the flow of ecosystem services and goods essential for human wellbeing, global society must secure a net gain in the extent and functioning of native ecosystems by investing not only in environmental protection, but also in environmental repair including ecological restoration. This repair must be implemented at multiple scales to achieve measurable effects worldwide. Awareness of the need for environmental repair is growing, resulting in a global escalation of ecological restoration and related efforts (see also Section 4, Part 3). For example, the United Nations (UN) Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) for 2030 call for restoration of marine and coastal ecosystems (Goal 14) and terrestrial ecosystems (Goal 15) that have been degraded to ""protect, restore and promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, sustainably manage forests, combat desertification, and halt and reverse land degradation and halt biodiversity loss."" The Convention on Biological Diversity (2016) calls for the ""restoration of degraded natural and semi-natural ecosystems, including in urban environments, as a contribution to reversing the loss of biodiversity, recovering connectivity, improving ecosystem resilience, enhancing the provision of ecosystem services, mitigating and adapting to the effects of climate change, combating desertification and land degradation, and improving human well-being while reducing environmental risks and scarcities."" And, the United Nations General Assembly has declared 2021–2030 the ""Decade on Ecosystem Restoration."" The concept of restoration in many of these initiatives and agreements is very broad and includes many approaches to ecosystem management and nature-based solutions, all of which are valuable. The Standards address the relationship between ecological restoration and other ecosystem management and nature-based solutions, and clarify the specific role of ecological restoration in contributing to the goals of conserving biodiversity and improving human wellbeing worldwide. Repairing degraded ecosystems is a complex task requiring significant time, resources, and knowledge. Ecological restoration contributes in substantial ways to protecting biodiversity and human wellbeing, but many restoration projects and programs, however well intentioned, have underperformed. The Standards recognize that appropriate design; good planning and implementation; sufficient knowledge, skill, effort and resources; understanding of specific social contexts and risks; appropriate stakeholder involvement; and adequate monitoring for adaptive management will contribute to improved outcomes. Application of principles and standards can increase effectiveness of ecological restoration efforts by establishing criteria for technical implementation across different ecosystem types. They also provide a framework that engages stakeholders and respects socio-cultural realities and needs, which can be applied to both mandatory (i.e. required as part of consent conditions) and non-mandatory restoration (i.e. the voluntary repair of damage). These criteria can improve ecological restoration outcomes, whether used to guide agencies, companies, or individuals engaged in planning, implementation, and monitoring; to guide regulators in developing agreements for mandatory restoration and evaluating whether those agreements have been met; or to guide policymakers in designing, supporting, funding, and evaluating restoration projects at any scale. Thus, the use of clear and carefully considered principles and standards underpinning ecological restoration can reduce the risk of unintended damage to ecosystems and native biodiversity, and help to develop high-quality projects and programs amenable to monitoring and assessment. This document expands upon and joins SER's collection of foundation documents including the SER International Primer on Ecological Restoration (SER 2004), Guidelines for Developing and Managing Restoration Projects (Clewell et al. 2005), Ecological Restoration—a Means of Conserving Biodiversity and Sustaining Livelihoods (Gann & Lamb 2006), and Ecological Restoration for Protected Areas: Principles, Guidelines and Best Practices (Keenleyside et al. 2012). It also utilizes SER's Code of Ethics (SER 2013) and specifically draws on material and models in the two editions of National Standards for the Practice of Ecological Restoration in Australia (McDonald et al. 2016a, 2018). Several books were influential including Restoration Ecology: The New Frontier (Van Andel & Aronson 2012), Ecological Restoration: Principles, Values and Structure of an Emerging Profession (Clewell & Aronson 2013), Foundations of Restoration Ecology (Palmer et al. 2016), Routledge Handbook of Ecological and Environmental Restoration (Allison & Murphy 2017), and Management of Ecological Rehabilitation Projects (Liu & Clewell 2017). We have drawn content from the editorial Ecosystem Restoration is Now a Global Priority (Aronson & Alexander 2013), and the policy documents Ecosystem Restoration: Short-term Action Plan of the CBD (Convention on Biological Diversity 2016), Partnering with Nature: The Case for Natural Regeneration in Forest and Landscape Restoration (Chazdon et al. 2017), and Restoring Forests and Landscapes: The Key to a Sustainable Future by the Global Partnership on Forest and Landscape Restoration (GPFLR; Besseau et al. 2018). Works published in SER's journal Restoration Ecology, book series on The Science and Practice of Ecological Restoration (Island Press), and Restoration Resource Center, as well as many other documents have informed development of this edition. While Sections 1 through 3 are mostly free of references for brevity's sake, Section 4 (Leading Practices), Appendix 1, and Supplement S1 include citations. To better address the diverse roles people play in restoration and how the goals of Indigenous groups fit into the overall picture of ecological restoration, we have reorganized the Principles to better incorporate social-economic and cultural factors that can greatly affect outcomes of restoration. Principle 1 expands on social goals and includes a ""Social Benefits Wheel"" tool to help convey social targets and goals of a project. Principles and Key Concepts are merged into a single section on Principles. A compilation of historical documents used to synthesize the Principles is provided in Supplement S1. Scaling-up ecological restoration and the relationship between ecological restoration and allied activities included in Section 4 of the first edition are incorporated into Principles 7 and 8 in this version. Key topics related to reference models and restoration approaches are included in a new section on Leading Practices (Section 4), which also considers integration of ecological restoration into global restoration initiatives. We added a technical appendix on sourcing of seeds and other propagules for restoration. SER defines ecological restoration as the process of assisting the recovery of an ecosystem that has been degraded, damaged, or destroyed. It is distinct from restoration ecology, the science that supports the practice of ecological restoration, and from other forms of environmental repair in seeking to assist recovery of native ecosystems and ecosystem integrity. Ecological restoration aims to move a degraded ecosystem to a trajectory of recovery that allows adaptation to local and global changes, as well as persistence and evolution of its component species. Ecological restoration is commonly used to describe both the process and the outcome sought for an ecosystem, but the Standards reserve the term restoration for the activity undertaken and recovery for the outcome sought or achieved. The Standards define ecological restoration as any activity with the goal of achieving substantial ecosystem recovery relative to an appropriate reference model, regardless of the time required to achieve recovery. Reference models used for ecological restoration projects are informed by native ecosystems, including many traditional cultural ecosystems (see Principle 3). Ecological restoration projects or programs include one or more targets that identify the native ecosystem to be restored (as informed by the reference model), and project goals that establish the level of recovery sought. Full recovery is defined as the state or condition whereby, following restoration, all key ecosystem attributes closely resemble those of the reference model. These attributes include absence of threats, species composition, community structure, physical conditions, ecosystem function, and external exchanges. Where lower levels of recovery are planned or occur due to resource, technical, environmental, or social constraints, recovery is referred to as partial recovery. An ecological restoration project or program should aspire to substantial recovery of the native biota and ecosystem functions (contrast with rehabilitation below). When full recovery is the goal, an important benchmark is when the ecosystem demonstrates self-organization. At this stage, if unexpected barriers or lack of particular species or processes take recovery off course, further restoration actions may be required to ensure that the trajectory ultimately continues toward full recovery. Once fully recovered, any ongoing activities (e.g. to maintain disturbance regimes) would be considered ecosystem maintenance or management. Specific activities, such as prescribed fire or the control of invasive species, may be used in both restoration and maintenance phases of a project. The goal of rehabilitation projects is not native ecosystem recovery, but rather reinstating a level of ecosystem functioning for renewed and ongoing provision of ecosystem services potentially derived from nonnative ecosystems as well. Rehabilitation is one of many restorative activities aligned along a continuum that includes ecological restoration and its allied and complementary activities, all of which contribute to improving ecosystem integrity and social–ecological resilience (see Principle 8). A few assumptions about the role of ecological restoration underpin the Standards. First, restoration of most native ecosystems is a challenging process, and substantial recovery usually requires long periods of time. Consequently, many ecological restoration projects are still far from achieving the levels of biodiversity, ecosystem functioning, and delivery of services of intact ecosystems. Thus, while compensation may be mandated as a result of ecosystem loss or degradation, the potential for ecological restoration should never be invoked as a justification for destroying or damaging existing native ecosystems or for unsustainable use. Similarly, any potential to translocate rare species should not be used to justify destruction of existing intact habitat. Where compensation is mandated, however, the level of compensation should be far in excess of the estimated ecosystem loss or degradation, and care should be exercised to ensure offsets do not cause additional degradation. Second, the Standards clarify the use of a native reference ecosystem as a model for the ecosystem being restored. The reference model, derived from multiple sources of information, aims to characterize the condition of the ecosystem as it would be had it not been degraded, adjusted as necessary to accommodate changed or predicted change in biotic or environmental conditions (e.g. climate change). The Standards also make clear that appropriate reference models for ecological restoration are not based on immobilizing an ecological community at some past point in time, but rather increasing potential for native species and communities to recover and continue to reassemble, adapt, and evolve. Finally, ecological restoration is part of a larger set of ecosystem management practices designed to conserve and, where appropriate, sustainably utilize native ecosystems. These practices range from regenerative agriculture, fisheries, and forestry to ecological engineering, including those invoked in the Convention on Biological Diversity, the United Nations 2030 Sustainable Development Goals, and by Forest Landscape Restoration (FLR) projects and a multitude of local and regional programs. As such, ecological restoration complements other conservation activities and nature-based solutions and vice versa. The following Principles provide a framework to explain, define, guide, and measure the activities and outcomes of ecological restoration practice (Fig. 1). They represent a distillation of principles and concepts presented in SER foundational documents, scientific literature, and practitioner experience (Appendix S1). Ecological restoration is undertaken for many reasons including to recover ecosystem integrity and to satisfy personal, cultural, social-economic, and ecological values. This combination of ecological and social benefits can lead to improved social–ecological resilience. Humans benefit from a closer and reciprocal engagement with nature. Participating in restoration projects can be transformative, for example, when children involved in restoration projects develop personal ownership over restoration sites, or when community volunteers seek new career or vocational paths in restoration practice or science. Communities located within or near degraded ecosystems may gain health and other benefits from restoration that improves the quality of air, land, water, and habitats for native species. Indigenous peoples and local communities (both rural and urban) benefit where restoration reinforces nature-based cultures, practices, and livelihoods (e.g. subsistence fishing, hunting, and gathering). In addition, restoration can provide short-term and long-term employment opportunities for local stakeholders, creating positive ecological and economic feedback loops. Stakeholders can make or break a project. Recognizing the expectations and interests of stakeholders and directly involving them is key to ensuring that both nature and society mutually benefit. Stakeholders can help prioritize distribution of restoration actions across the landscape, set project goals (including desired level of recovery), contribute knowledge about ecological conditions and successional patterns to improve development of reference models, and engage in participatory monitoring. Additionally, stakeholders can provide political and financial support for long-term project sustainability, as well as moderating conflicts or disagreements that may arise.

",,,,"We report here the first evidence of faunistic equilibrium obtained through controlled, replicated experiments, together with an analysis of the immigration and extinction processes of animal species based on direct observations. The colonization of six small mangrove islands in Florida Bay by terrestrial arthropods was monitored at frequent intervals for 1 year after removal of the original fauna by methyl bromide fumigation. Both the observed data and climatic considerations imply that seasonality had little effect upon the basic shape of the colonization curves of species present vs. time. By 250 days after defaunation, the faunas of all the islands except the most distant one (""EI"") had regained species numbers and composition similar to those of untreated islands even though population densities were still abnormally low. Although early colonists included both weak and strong fliers, the former, particularly psocopterans, were usually the first to produce large populations. Among these same early invaders were the taxa displaying both the highest extinction rates and the greatest variability in species composition on the different islands. Ants, the ecological dominants of mangrove islands, were among the last to colonize, but they did so with highest degree of predictability. The colonization curves plus static observations on untreated islands indicate strongly that a dynamic equilibrium number of species exists for any island. We believe the curves are produced by colonization involving little if any interaction, then a gradual decline as interaction becomes important, and finally, a lasting dynamic equilibrium. Equations are given for the early immigration, extinction, and colonization curves. Dispersal to these islands is predominantly through aerial transport, both active and passive. Extinction of the earliest colonists is probably caused chiefly by such physical factors as drowning or lack of suitable breeding sites and less commonly by competition and predation. As population sizes increase it is expected that competition and predation will become more important. Observed turnover rates showed wide variance, with most values between 0.05 and 0.50 species/day. True turnover rates are probably much higher, with 0.67 species/day the extreme lower limit on any island. This very high value is at least roughly consistent with the turnover equation derived from the MacArthur—Wilson equilibrium model, which predicts turnover rates on the order of 0.1—1.0 species/day on the experimental islands.","0012-9658

",,,,"A major goal of ecology is to determine the causes of the latitudinal gradient in global distribution of species richness. Current evidence points to either energy availability or habitat heterogeneity as the most likely environmental drivers in terrestrial systems, but their relative importance is controversial in the absence of analyses of global (rather than continental or regional) extent. Here we use data on the global distribution of extant continental and continental island bird species to test the explanatory power of energy availability and habitat heterogeneity while simultaneously addressing issues of spatial resolution, spatial autocorrelation, geometric constraints upon species' range dynamics, and the impact of human populations and historical glacial ice-cover. At the finest resolution (1°), topographical variability and temperature are identified as the most important global predictors of avian species richness in multi-predictor models. Topographical variability is most important in single-predictor models, followed by productive energy. Adjusting for null expectations based on geometric constraints on species richness improves overall model fit but has negligible impact on tests of environmental predictors. Conclusions concerning the relative importance of environmental predictors of species richness cannot be extrapolated from one biogeographic realm to others or the globe. Rather a global perspective confirms the primary importance of mountain ranges in high-energy areas.

",,,,"Alien species are the principal threat to the conservation of the Galápagos Islands, but little is known about the status of nonindigenous Galápagos insects and their effects on the biota. Currently, 463 alien insect species have probably been introduced to the Galápagos, an increase of 186 unintentional species introductions since an inventory in 1998. Alien insects now constitute 23% of the total insect fauna. Six species are known to be invasive and a threat to the biota: two species of fire ant and two wasps, a scale insect, and an ectoparasitic dipteran. The ecological impacts of the remaining species are unknown, making the prioritization of action for conservation management difficult. Thus, a newly developed and simple scoring system is presented to predict their potential invasiveness based on trophic functional role, distribution in Galápagos, and history of invasiveness elsewhere. An additional 52 species are predicted to be highly invasive. The endemic flora is most at risk because the largest proportion (42%) of the introduced species is herbivores. Plant populations are threatened principally by vectors of plant disease and by phloem and leaf feeders. Introduced predators and parasitoids (17%) may either be affecting, or have the potential to affect, the status of terrestrial invertebrate populations. At least 10% of the species are considered to be negligible threats to Galápagos ecosystems.

",,,,"Abstract Aim To establish how well the terrestrial flora of the Antarctic has been sampled, how well the flora is known, and to determine the major patterns in diversity and biogeography. Location Antarctica south of 60° S, together with the South Sandwich Islands, but excluding South Georgia, Bouvetøya and the periantarctic islands. Methods Plant occurrence data were collated from herbarium specimens and literature records, and assembled into the Antarctic Plant Database. Distributional patterns were analysed using a geographic information system. Biogeographical patterns were determined with a variety of multivariate statistics. Results Plants have been recorded from throughout the Antarctic, including all latitudes between 60° S and 86° S. Species richness declines with latitude along the Antarctic Peninsula, but there was no evidence for a similar cline in Victoria Land and the Transantarctic mountains. Multi‐dimensional scaling ordinations showed that the species compositions of the South Orkney, South Shetland Islands and the north‐western Antarctic Peninsula are very similar to each other, as are the floras of different regions in continental Antarctica. They also suggest, however, that the eastern Antarctic Peninsula flora is more similar to the flora of the southern Antarctic Peninsula than to the continental flora (with which it has traditionally been linked). The South Sandwich Islands have a flora that is very dissimilar to that in all Antarctic regions, probably because of their isolation and volcanic nature. Main conclusions The Antarctic flora has been reasonably well sampled, but certain areas require further floristic surveys. Available data do, however, allow for a number of robust conclusions. A diversity gradient exists along the Antarctic Peninsula, with fewer species (but not fewer higher taxa) at higher latitudes. Multi‐dimensional scaling ordination suggests three major floral provinces within Antarctica: northern maritime, southern maritime, and continental. Patterns of endemism suggest that a proportion of the lichen flora may have an ancient vicariant distribution, while most bryophytes are more recent colonists.

","Holdaway, Richard; Worthy, Trevor; Tennyson, Alan",,Archipelago,,,2001.0,,,119,187,,,,,,28,2,"New Zealand Journal of Zoology
",,"Taylor & Francis
",,,,"Abstract We present an annotated working list of the bird species breeding in New Zealand during the late Pleistocene and Holocene, up to the time of human contact. New Zealand is defined as including the three main islands and the surrounding smaller islands, plus outlying island groups from Norfolk Island in the northwest, the Kermadec, Chatham, Bounty, Antipodes, Campbell, Auckland, Snares, to Macquarie Islands, but excluding islands south of Macquarie Island and the Ross Dependency. Inclusions or exclusions of species from the list were based on specified criteria. We include only species with a breeding population and not vagrants that occur in New Zealand but which breed elsewhere. Species with validly published names were included if there was fossil evidence for a breeding population before human contact. Species with a breeding population at the time of European contact were included unless contrary evidence from the fossil record indicates that they actually colonised after human settlement. Species without a fossil record were included if a breeding population exists on a relatively undisturbed island within the New Zealand archipelago as defined above. Species now present on the main islands were excluded if they are absent from all well‐documented fossil faunas. Species were excluded from the breeding fauna and treated as vagrants where sustained breeding has not been demonstrated. The phylogenetic species concept is applied both to fossil and to living taxa. The late Quaternary fossil record of birds in New Zealand is excellent, and the contribution of extinct taxa to the total list is understood at least as well as that of the surviving taxa. Many taxa presently recognised at subspecific level are treated here as full species. Twelve extinct species whose former presence is known from fossil evidence, but for which no description has been published, are listed under informal species designations. Taxonomic considerations limited the extent to which the main list could reflect present understanding of the diversity of the avifauna; some undescribed species are at present subsumed under one species name. Where previous taxonomic publications provide precedence, available names at the species‐level have been used. A supplementary hypothetical species list includes all nomenclatural changes signalled in extensive annotations to the main list. In this list we accept 245 species in 110 genera representing 46 families; 176 species were endemic to the archipelago. Preliminary biogeographic analyses based on the composition of the supplementary list show that there were four separate regional faunas: a northern subtropical fauna (Norfolk, Kermadecs); the major fauna of the main islands (North, South, Stewart, and offshore islands); a Chathams fauna (Chatham Islands only); and a subantarctic fauna on the southern islands. Species with wider distributions formed link groups. The origin and compositions of the regional avifaunas and their endemic species differ with their geographic position, climate, and proximity to source faunas. Instances of speciation in groups such as the Coenocoiypha snipe and Petroica flycatchers, and adaptive radiations in groups including moa and acanthisittid wrens, show that there are many avenues for research on the rate of evolution in island and mainland populations of New Zealand birds and that there are large gaps in knowledge of even common taxa. A brief case study demonstrates the inadequacies of using species lists that do not include Holocene fossil species. Species‐area curves based on the total fauna differ substantially from those developed in previous studies based on incomplete, or biased, lists. Pleistocene glaciations caused the pattern of distribution of species on the main islands to change in concert with vegetation changes. Other possible effects include the elimination of warm climate species early in the cooling phase more than 1 million years ago, the speciation in groups including waders and parrots as new habitats (e.g., braided riverbeds and alpine areas) appeared, and the appearance regularly during the Pleistocene of islands that were potential staging points for colonisation of the Chatham Islands. For at least the past 100 000 years, until 2000 years ago, the fauna appears to have been very stable in composition, despite strong cyclic fluctuations in climate and vegetation. The effects of extinctions within the past 2000 years on the composition of the present fauna include the elimination of most of the endemic taxa from all but the subantarctic faunas. Only 169 species of the original late Holocene breeding fauna survive. The extinctions have resulted in a strong bias towards marine and coastal taxa in the present avifauna, in contrast to the balanced representation of terrestrial and marine species in the Pleistocene and Holocene fauna. The importance of systematic studies and the determination of the status of island populations to conservation and basic ornithological research is emphasised. The systematic status of many New Zealand birds is poorly known at present. Keywords: avifaunalistbreeding speciesphylogenetic species conceptNew Zealandextinctionevolutionbiogeographynew synonymy

","Baker, Patrick",,Tropical forest; Tropical rain forest,,,2009.0,,,"vii

",,"Oxford University Press
",,,,"Tropical forests have, in equal measure, fascinated and frustrated naturalists, explorers and scientists for centuries. Few other terrestrial ecosystems confront ecologists so plainly with their empirical and theoretical shortcomings. As Marlow, the narrator of Joseph Conrad's Heart of Darkness muses ‘… all that mysterious life of the wilderness that stirs in the forest, in the jungles, … He has to live in the midst of the incomprehensible, which is detestable. And it has a fascination, too, that goes to work upon him’. For botanists, ecologists and zoologists working in tropical forests, the remarkable diversity is intriguing and captivating, but simultaneously overwhelming. Thirty years ago the flow of new research from tropical forests was but a trickle. As Joe Wright, a senior scientist with the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute (STRI), notes in his foreword to this excellent volume, one or two new papers a week on tropical forests in those days meant that it was relatively easy to stay abreast of the current research. By the mid-2000s, however, this trickle had become a torrent, with the number of publications on tropical forests increasing by nearly an order of magnitude. No longer is it possible for students of tropical forests to keep up with all of the new research being published on the subject. Carson and Schnitzer's timely volume provides a much-needed stock-taking of ideas about the ecology of tropical forests, looking both backwards to the observational foundations and forwards to the theoretical and empirical future of tropical forest ecology.

Two major advances in tropical forest ecology – one methodological and one theoretical – animate this book. The first is the establishment of large-scale, permanent forest-dynamics plots in most of the major tropical forest regions of the world. These plots are typically 25–50 ha in size and catalogue, every 5 years, the size, location and species' identification of every tree with a diameter at breast height >1 cm. The logistical challenges of creating and maintaining these plots are enormous, but over the past 25 years, STRI and its Center for Tropical Forest Science (CTFS) have not only successfully developed the protocols for doing so, but have expanded the network of tropical forest plots to now include 18 sites with ∼3 million trees representing ∼6000 species. The CTFS plots provide statistically useful samples of tree communities and the species' populations that comprise them. This has enabled both robust quantitative estimates of demography, spatial patterning and abundance, and, because of the standard protocols across the CTFS network, has allowed direct comparisons of these estimates among tropical forests differing in location, seasonality and species' diversity. The impact of the CTFS plots on tropical forest ecology is plainly seen in Carson and Schnitzer's book, in which over half of the chapters are either based on or heavily cite research conducted in CTFS plots.

The second major advance, which stems from the first, is the development by Steve Hubbell of the neutral theory of biogeography and biodiversity (Hubbell, 2001) based on his work at the first CTFS plot at Barro Colorado Island, Panama. In brief, Hubbell proposed that patterns of species' abundance in forest samples can be predicted from a model with a small number of free parameters and simplifying assumptions about processes such as speciation and recruitment. Neutral theory has jolted a discipline long focused on describing patterns and processes into carefully questioning many of its most fundamental assumptions. The simplifying assumption of neutral theory that has received the most attention is that species' identity is unimportant (i.e. all species are equivalent) in describing relative species' abundance in tropical forest communities. This is controversial because it plainly contradicts over 50 years of ecological and botanical work on tropical tree species' biology. Several of the chapters in this volume, a wonderfully readable one by Hubbell included, address and explore this gap between neutral and niche-based models of relative abundance.

Together, these advances have led to a gathering shift away from old theoretical ideas (Janzen–Connell effects, gap-phase dynamics) about tropical forest ecology to new ones (neutral theory, recruitment limitation) and a growing appreciation for, and understanding of, stochasticity in tropical forest communities. The many contributing authors in Carson and Schnitzer's book detail this shift and contemplate the ways forward. The book itself is neatly divided into five sections (each with 3–6 chapters): (1) Large-scale patterns in tropical communities; (2) Testing theories of forest regeneration and the maintenance of species diversity; (3) Animal community ecology and trophic interactions; (4) Secondary forest succession, dynamics, and invasion; and (5) Tropical forest conservation. For readers like me, who enjoy dipping non-linearly into edited volumes, Carson and Schnitzer's first chapter presents a nice overview of the book by giving a 1–2 paragraph description of the key points of the chapters, their broader relevance, and their connections to other chapters. With surprisingly few exceptions, the chapters are concise, well-written and thought-provoking. Importantly, the editors were broad-minded in their definition of tropical forest community ecology. The inclusion of excellent chapters by, for example, Peres on soil fertility and arboreal mammals, Dyer on tritrophic cascades, and Arnold on endophytic fungi provide a nice counterbalance to the many chapters on tropical trees. The concluding chapter by Putz and Zuidema questioning the relevance of ecology to the conservation of tropical forests may seem a bit of a surprise in such a volume – indeed, they directly contravene the bland rainforest conservation chapter by Corlett and Primack – but is a breath of fresh, pragmatic air and should be read by all ecologists interested in the future of tropical forests. Does this volume have any shortcomings? I would have liked a chapter on palaeoecological insights into tropical forest ecology and I thought the two chapters on tropical forest succession were weak, but these are minor quibbles. The book is well-edited, well-produced, nearly free of typos (annual gross production in neotropical forests is not 3 kg C ha−1!) and (in paperback) very affordable.

In conclusion, the recent advances in data collection and theory described in this volume have made the past decade one of the most exciting and important periods in the study of tropical forests. Carson and Schnitzer and the many contributing authors capture this excitement and the tectonic shifts that are underway in this new book. If you intend to buy only one book on tropical forest ecology in the next 10 years, buy this one. It is, simply put, outstanding.

",,"Wiley
",,,,"Aim The New Zealand terrestrial mollusc fauna is among the most speciose in the world, with often remarkably high richness at lowland forest sites. We sought to elucidate general explanations for patterns of richness in terrestrial mollusc communities by analysis of species coexistence and habitat relationships within a New Zealand district fauna.

Location Pukeamaru Ecological District, eastern North Island, New Zealand.

Methods We sampled molluscs using qualitative methods at twenty-three sites and quantitatively by frame sampling of scrubland-forest floor litter at sixteen of these sites and analysed patterns of species richness and turnover in relation to regional species pools and local habitat attributes. We then tested for nonrandom assemblage of taxa along diversity and habitat gradients.

Results Ninety-four indigenous mollusc species were recorded from a district fauna estimated at 102 indigenous species: only two species were endemic. From the presumptive geological history of the district, the low endemism, and Brooks parsimony and indicator species analyses of faunal relationships, the communities were indicated to have resulted by accumulation of colonists from other New Zealand districts since the Miocene. Richness ranged from two or three indigenous species in dune habitats to fifty-nine species in a floristically rich forest. Beta diversity was high and site occupancy per species was low, indicating communities structured by successive replacement of ecological equivalents. Sites differing in vegetation had characteristic species assemblages, indicating a degree of habitat specialization. Canonical correspondence analysis indicated that canopy tree species, canopy height, floristic diversity, altitude, litter mass, and litter pH were important determinants of species assemblage in scrubland and forest. Richness was strongly associated with site floristic diversity and, for litter-dwelling species, the pH of litter substrate. High richness occurred at those sites supporting molluscs in high abundance. Shell-shape distributions were essentially Cainian unimodal, with communities dominated by snail species with subglobose to discoidal shells. Mean and variance of shell size increased with mollusc species richness and floristic diversity at sites, indicating dominance of communities by small-shelled species at early successional or floristically poor sites, and increased richness resulting from addition of larger snails into vacant niches. Shifts in shell form were associated with sympatry in several congeneric taxa.

Main conclusions The underdispersion of shell shape, relative to faunas elsewhere in the world, indicates that community structure in New Zealand land snail faunas has been constrained by limited phylogenetic diversity and/or by convergence upon successful adaptations. The remarkably high richness that characterizes these communities indicates special conditions allow coexistence of numerous species. The relationship between floristic diversity at sites and the richness, diversity, and shell-size distributions of the molluscs suggests assemblages structured around niche partitioning among competing species. While there is an element of congruence between vegetation and mollusc pattern, this study indicates that assembly rules will be defined, and spatial pattern predicted, only through a better understanding of the linkage between regional species pool, organism traits, environment, and local community assemblage.","0305-0270

",,"Wiley
",,,,"Summary 1. Freshwater ecosystems are amongst the most threatened and poorly protected globally. They continue to be degraded through habitat loss, pollution and invading species and conservation measures are urgently needed to halt declining trends in their biodiversity and integrity. 2. During the past decade a suite of decision support tools and computational approaches have been developed for efficient and targeted conservation action in terrestrial or marine ecosystems. These methods may be poorly suited for planning in freshwater systems because connectivity in terrestrial and marine systems is typically modelled in a way unsuitable for rivers, where connectivity has a strong directional component. 3. We modify the conservation prioritization method and software, zonation , to account for connectivity in a manner better suited to freshwater ecosystems. Prioritization was performed using subcatchment/catchment‐based planning units and connectivity was modified to have directional upstream and downstream components consistent with the ecology of our target species. 4. We demonstrate this modified method for rivers and streams in the southern North Island of New Zealand. Data included predicted occupancy from boosted regression tree models of species distributions for 18 fish species. The study area covered 2.1 million hectares and included 394 first‐ to fourth order catchment or subcatchment planning units. 5. Realistic modelling of connectivity had a major influence on the areas proposed for conservation. If connectivity was ignored, recommended conservation areas were very fragmented. By contrast, when connectivity was modelled, high priority conservation targets consisted of entire river basins or headwater subcatchments. 6. The proposed method serves as a starting point for the implementation of reserve selection methods in river ecosystems.

To address this issue, patterns of bacterial diversity were studied in soils sampled along a > 3200 km southern polar transect spanning a gradient of increased climate severity over 27° of latitude. Vegetated and fell-field plots were sampled at the Falkland (51°S), South Georgia (54°S), Signy (60°S) and Anchorage Islands (67°S), while bare frost-sorted soil polygons were examined at Fossil Bluff (71°S), Mars Oasis (72°S), Coal Nunatak (72°S) and the Ellsworth Mountains (78°S). Bacterial 16S rRNA gene sequences were recovered subsequent to direct DNA extraction from soil, polymerase chain reaction amplification and cloning. Although bacterial diversity was observed to decline with increased latitude, habitat-specific patterns appeared to also be important. Namely, a negative relationship was found between bacterial diversity and latitude for fell-field soils, but no such pattern was observed for vegetated sites. The Mars Oasis site, previously identified as a biodiversity hotspot within this region, proved exceptional within the study transect, with unusually high bacterial diversity. In independent analyses, geographical distance and vegetation cover were found to significantly influence bacterial community composition. These results provide insight into the factors shaping the composition of bacterial communities in Antarctic terrestrial habitats and support the notion that bacterial diversity declines with increased climatic severity.","1462-2912

The skewed regional distribution and small number of large reserves per country call for the expansion of existing protected areas and, where possible the establishment of new parks and transfrontier reserves.

Considering four global circulation model outputs and three emission scenarios, we generated an index of risk of exposure to extreme climates, and we used a bivariate local Moran's I to identify the areas with a significant association between hotspots of diversity and high risk of exposure to extreme climates. Our results outline that the Mediterranean basin represents both an important hotspot for biodiversity and especially for threatened species for all taxa. In particular, the Iberian and Italian peninsulas host particularly high species richness as measured over all groups, while the eastern Mediterranean basin is particularly rich in amphibians and reptiles; the islands (both Macaronesian and Mediterranean) host the highest richness of threatened species for all taxa occurs. Our results suggest that the main hotspots of biodiversity for terrestrial vertebrates may be extensively influenced by the climate change projected to occur over the coming decades, especially in the Mediterranean bioregion, posing serious concerns for biodiversity conservation.

",,,,"The Antarctic is considered to be a pristine environment relative to other regions of the Earth, but it is increasingly vulnerable to invasions by marine, freshwater and terrestrial non-native species. The Antarctic Peninsula region (APR), which encompasses the Antarctic Peninsula, South Shetland Islands and South Orkney Islands, is by far the most invaded part of the Antarctica continent. The risk of introduction of invasive non-native species to the APR is likely to increase with predicted increases in the intensity, diversity and distribution of human activities. Parties that are signatories to the Antarctic Treaty have called for regional assessments of non-native species risk. In response, taxonomic and Antarctic experts undertook a horizon scanning exercise using expert opinion and consensus approaches to identify the species that are likely to present the highest risk to biodiversity and ecosystems within the APR over the next 10 years. One hundred and three species, currently absent in the APR, were identified as relevant for review, with 13 species identified as presenting a high risk of invading the APR. Marine invertebrates dominated the list of highest risk species, with flowering plants and terrestrial invertebrates also represented; however, vertebrate species were thought unlikely to establish in the APR within the 10 year timeframe. We recommend (a) the further development and application of biosecurity measures by all stakeholders active in the APR, including surveillance for species such as those identified during this horizon scanning exercise, and (b) use of this methodology across the other regions of Antarctica. Without the application of appropriate biosecurity measures, rates of introductions and invasions within the APR are likely to increase, resulting in negative consequences for the biodiversity of the whole continent, as introduced species establish and spread further due to climate change and increasing human activity.

",,"Wiley
",,,,"Ecology affects each of the three principal processes leading to speciation: genetic differentiation among populations within species, acquisition of reproductive isolation among populations, and the rise of ecological differentiation among such populations, allowing them to coexist. Until recently, however, the ties between ecology and speciation in plants have received relatively little attention. This paper reviews some exciting new insights into the role of ecology in speciation, focusing on the angiosperms. I consider five main topics, including (1) the determinants of the spatial scale of genetic differentiation within species; (2) the role and limits of adaptive radiation in increasing net rates of plant diversification; (3) the potential role of ecological speciation; (4) the contributions of hybridization to speciation, adaptive radiation, and the ecological breadth of clades; and (5) the ecological determinants of net diversification rate for individual lineages, and of the species richness for regional floras. Limited dispersal, especially of seeds, favors genetic differentiation at small spatial scales and is likely to foster rapid speciation and narrow endemism. Meta­analyses show that the minimum area required for in situ speciation on islands increases with the spatial scale of gene flow in various organisms. In angiosperms, fleshy fruits dispersed by vertebrates often increase the distance over which seeds are dispersed, but can decrease it in forest understories. Nutrient-poor soils should work against the evolution of fleshy fruits and promote speciation and narrow endemism. Selection for adaptation to different conditions drives adaptive radiation, the rise of a diversity of ecological roles and attendant adaptations within a lineage. On islands, adaptive radiation often leads to woodiness, monocarpy, developmental heterophylly, and sexual dimorphism, as well as differences in habitat, growth form, and floral morphology. Adaptive radiation appears to accelerate speciation in only some plant clades. Extensive radiation in some lineages has been ascribed to early colonization, large amounts of heritable genetic variation, “genetic lines of least resistance” upon which selection could act, absence of potential competitors, and possession of “key innovations” that provide access to novel resources. To these should be added large island area, organismal abundance, saturation of ecological space, and the synergism action of limited dispersal and divergent selection producing parallel radiations in isolated regions. Data for Hawaiian lobeliads suggest that within­island species richness of Cyanea—involving divergence in elevation and flower tube length—saturates within 0.6 and 1.5 Ma. Adaptive radiation in pollinators is an important mechanism of ecological speciation: adaptation to different pollinators leads to pollinator partitioning and reproductive isolation. Selection for longer nectar spurs and pollinator mouth parts led to increased speciation in Aquilegia and other groups. A similar process may work once tubular flowers evolve from cup­shaped blossoms. Selection for floral divergence may be limited in forest understories illuminated by dim, greenish light, which may account for the predominance of small, visually inconspicuous flowers in temperate and tropical understory species. Hybridization can stimulate speciation by forming transgressive phenotypes that exceed the range seen in parental taxa, and by introgressing adaptive gene combinations. The likelihood of transgressive phenotypes increases with the genetic divergence between parental taxa, so speciation via transgressive hybridization may be most likely among taxa with intermediate amounts of divergence. Several large adaptive radiations appear to have occurred after hybridization, suggesting a special role for the extensive amount of genetic variation that can be supplied and refreshed by syngameons. Rates of net species diversification are greater in herbs (especially annuals) vs. woody plants; in animal­ vs. wind­pollinated species; in plants with poorly dispersed seeds; in families with a greater diversity of growth forms, pollination and seed dispersal mechanisms, and species distributions; in families at lower latitudes; in families with higher rates of genetic evolution; in hermaphroditic or monoecious vs. dioecious clades; in earlier­maturing woody plants; in plants with bilateral vs. radial flowers; in plants with hummingbird­pollinated flowers; in epiphytic vs. terrestrial bromeliads and orchids; in bromeliads differentiating along geographically extensive cordilleras; and in young vs. old clades. Evidence for the last pattern may, however, be an artifact of (auto)regressing (ln N) / t vs. t. High rates of diversification in epiphytic orchids are tied to small effective population sizes, suggesting a role for intermittent genetic drift alternating with strong selection on floral traits. Across angiosperms, a massive increase in diversification rates was preceded by a major increase in leaf vein density and hydraulic conductance between 140 and 110 Ma ago, leading to higher photosynthetic rates than coexisting ferns and gymnosperms. Based on the economic theory of plant defense, this should have led to lower allocation to anti­herbivore defenses, selecting for low­cost qualitative toxins rather than all­purpose but highly expensive qualitative defenses, triggering an arms' race between angiosperm and their herbivores. Finally, regional plant species richness increases with regional area and proxies for latitude, rainfall, topographic heterogeneity, and vegetation stratification. The Cape Floristic Province has roughly twice as many species as expected from its area and environmental conditions, most likely reflecting the predominance of short­distance dispersal associated with poor soils and myrmecochory in the Cape Province, as well as low rates of regeneration and competitive exclusion following fire.","0040-0262

",,"Wiley
",,,,"Abstract Aim Introduced alien species are frequently implicated in ecosystem disruption and biodiversity loss, but some ecologists have recently argued that efforts to manage ecosystems should be refocused on known problematic species without regard to whether such species are native or alien. This argument rests on the premise that native and alien species in general do not differ in their impacts. Although there are numerous cases that suggest alien predators and herbivores can sometimes cause severe declines or even local extinctions of native species, very few studies have compared the impacts of native and alien consumers on native populations. Location World‐wide. Methods We have conducted a meta‐analysis on a global dataset to compare the effects of native and alien predators and herbivores on native populations occupying a broad range of terrestrial and aquatic environments. Results The distribution of positive, negative and neutral effects on native prey abundance differed significantly by consumer origin, with alien consumers associated with more negative and fewer positive effects than expected, opposite the finding for native consumers. The effect size of alien consumers was 2.4 times greater than that of native consumers and did not differ between predators and herbivores. The impact of alien consumers did not differ significantly in aquatic (lakes, rivers, oceans) versus terrestrial (continental, island) habitats. Similarly, there was no significant interaction between consumer origin and location, as consumers had similar effects in insular (freshwater, island) and open (continental, marine) systems – contrary to the notion that alien species impacts are mainly problematic for island biota. Main conclusions We hypothesize that the ecological naïveté of native biota facilitates their enhanced suppression by alien predators and herbivores relative to native enemies. Our results counter the assertion that the biogeographical origin of species has no bearing on their ecological impact.

",,,,"Abstract: The potential for conservation of individual species has been greatly advanced by the International Union for Conservation of Nature's (IUCN) development of objective, repeatable, and transparent criteria for assessing extinction risk that explicitly separate risk assessment from priority setting. At the IV World Conservation Congress in 2008, the process began to develop and implement comparable global standards for ecosystems. A working group established by the IUCN has begun formulating a system of quantitative categories and criteria, analogous to those used for species, for assigning levels of threat to ecosystems at local, regional, and global levels. A final system will require definitions of ecosystems; quantification of ecosystem status; identification of the stages of degradation and loss of ecosystems; proxy measures of risk (criteria); classification thresholds for these criteria; and standardized methods for performing assessments. The system will need to reflect the degree and rate of change in an ecosystem's extent, composition, structure, and function, and have its conceptual roots in ecological theory and empirical research. On the basis of these requirements and the hypothesis that ecosystem risk is a function of the risk of its component species, we propose a set of four criteria: recent declines in distribution or ecological function, historical total loss in distribution or ecological function, small distribution combined with decline, or very small distribution. Most work has focused on terrestrial ecosystems, but comparable thresholds and criteria for freshwater and marine ecosystems are also needed. These are the first steps in an international consultation process that will lead to a unified proposal to be presented at the next World Conservation Congress in 2012. Resumen: El potencial para la conservación de muchas especies ha avanzado enormemente porque la Unión Internacional para la Conservación de la Naturaleza (UICN) ha desarrollado criterios objetivos, repetibles y transparentes para evaluar el riesgo de extinción que explícitamente separa la evaluación de riesgo de la definición de prioridades. En el IV Congreso Mundial de Conservación en 2008, el proceso comenzó a desarrollar e implementar estándares globales comparables para ecosistemas. Un grupo de trabajo establecido por la UICN ha formulado un sistema inicial de categorías y criterios cuantitativos, análogos a los utilizados para especies, para asignar niveles de amenaza a ecosistemas a niveles local, regional y global. Un sistema final requerirá de definiciones de ecosistemas; cuantificación del estatus de ecosistemas; identificación de las etapas de degradación y pérdida de los ecosistemas; medidas de riesgo (criterios) alternativas; umbrales de clasificación para esos criterios y métodos estandarizados para la realización de evaluaciones. El sistema deberá reflejar el nivel y tasa de cambio en la extensión, composición, estructura y funcionamiento de un ecosistema, y tener sus raíces conceptuales en la teoría ecológica y la investigación empírica. Sobre la base de esos requerimientos y la hipótesis de que el riesgo del ecosistema es una función del riesgo de las especies que lo componen, proponemos un conjunto de 4 criterios: declinaciones recientes en la distribución o funcionamiento ecológica, pérdida total histórica en la distribución o funcionamiento ecológico, distribución pequeña combinada con declinación, o distribución muy pequeña. La mayor parte del trabajo se ha concentrado en ecosistemas terrestres, pero también se requieren umbrales y criterios comparables para ecosistemas dulceacuícolas y marinos. Estos son los primeros pasos de un proceso de consulta internacional que llevará a una propuesta unificada que será presentada en el próximo Congreso Mundial de Conservación en 2012. In the last 50 years, humans have altered the world's ecosystems more than during any other time span in history. Twenty to seventy percent of the area of 11 of the 13 terrestrial biomes evaluated in the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (2005a) has been converted to human use. Although informed and effective policy may slow land conversion (Watson 2005), there is no consistent, widely accepted scientific framework for tracking the status of Earth's ecosystems and identifying those with a high probability of loss or degradation (Nicholson et al. 2009). Recognizing this gap, the fourth IUCN (International Union for Conservation of Nature) World Conservation Congress launched a process to develop criteria for assessing the status of and establishing a global red list of ecosystems (IV World Conservation Congress 2008). We use the term ecosystem as an assemblage of organisms that occur together in space and time and interact with each other and their physical environment (Odum 1971). The IUCN uses quantitative and qualitative criteria to classify species by their probability of extinction (i.e., extinction risk) and to guide policy and interventions at all levels (IUCN 2010a). Furthermore, the IUCN's criteria are the basis for some of the Convention on Biological Diversity's indicators (CBD 2003, 2010) and indices of biological diversity (Butchart et al. 2004, 2007), which are being used to track progress toward international conservation targets (Millennium Development Goals 2009; Walpole et al. 2009). At national scales, species red lists inform policy and action in more than 100 countries and provide ample data for other conservation applications (IUCN 2010a; Zamin et al. 2010). Ecosystem red lists have the potential to complement the policy successes of species red lists in several ways. Ecosystems may more effectively represent biological diversity as a whole than do individual species (Noss 1996; Cowling et al. 2004), especially given the taxonomic bias of the current IUCN Red List (Vié et al. 2009; Stuart et al. 2010). Moreover, they include fundamental abiotic components that are only indirectly included in species assessments (e.g., riverine ecosystems; Beechie et al. 2010). Declines in ecosystem status may also be more apparent than extirpations or extinctions of individual species; society often perceives loss of biological diversity in terms of loss of benefits such as clean water, food, timber, and fuel (Millennium Ecosystem Assessment 2005a). Ecosystem-level assessments may also be less time consuming than species-by-species assessments. Despite concerted efforts, by 2010 the status of only 47,978 of the world's 1,740,330 known species (<3%) had been evaluated for potential inclusion on the IUCN Red List (IUCN 2010a). Furthermore, red lists of ecosystems may suggest areas in which extirpations are likely to result from extinction debt in response to loss and fragmentation of species' habitats (Terborgh 1974; Terborgh et al. 1997; Tilman et al. 1994) because decline in the extent and status of an ecosystem may precede the loss of its species. When used in tandem with species red lists, ecosystem red lists could provide the most informative indicator to date of the status of other elements of biological and abiotic diversity. Our objective here is to initiate a global consultation on the development of categories and criteria for a red list of ecosystems that is based on the best available science and draws from the experiences of the IUCN (2010a). Key challenges must be addressed to develop robust methods to assess the probability that the status of ecosystems has declined or will decline. These challenges include defining ecosystems and the spatial units appropriate for assessment and determining a set of thresholds within criteria, thresholds such as amount of decline in geographical distribution or degree of degradation that must be reached in order to qualify for a corresponding category (e.g., endangered, vulnerable). The criteria and thresholds need to be broad enough to encompass many different types of ecosystem classifications, and yet specific enough to allow their application to geographical extents relevant to conservation decision making. We ask scientists with relevant expertise to join us in building a scientifically sound, credible, and objective system for assessing the level of threat to ecosystems worldwide of elimination or degradation. Several protocols for assessing ecosystem status have been applied already, and they provide a base on which to build a global standard (Nicholson et al. 2009). In Australia, as a result of a continuing national assessment of ""ecological communities,"" by 2008 40 communities had been listed as threatened under federal law, and many more have been listed by states (Department of Environment and Conservation of New South Wales 2009; Department of Environment and Conservation of Western Australia 2009). Similarly, the South African National Environmental Management: Biodiversity Act (DEAT 2004) resulted in the identification of over 200 threatened ecosystems (Reyers et al. 2007; SANBI & DEAT 2009). Analogous assessment frameworks have been proposed for European countries (Austria, Paal 1998; Essl et al. 2002; Raunio et al. 2008), the Americas (Faber-Langendoen et al. 2007), and other regions (Nicholson et al. 2009). To integrate these initiatives for assessing ecosystem status into a single global system, a shared vision of the goal is essential. We envision that a unified system for assessing ecosystem status will be based on criteria that are transparent, objective, and scientifically sound, and thresholds that are associated with different levels of risk of elimination and loss of function, are easily quantified and monitored, and facilitate comparisons among ecosystems. The criteria must be applicable to terrestrial, marine, and freshwater systems at multiple spatial extents (local to global) and resolutions (fine to coarse) and to data from diverse sources, both historical and current. Like the IUCN Red List criteria for species, a global set of criteria for ecosystems must be easily understood by policy makers and the public. Additionally it should be made explicit that risk assessments are just one component of conservation priority setting and thus should be consistent with the species-based approach for red lists. To achieve this vision, multiple scientific challenges must be met, starting with a definition of the basic ecosystem units to be assessed. Classical definitions of ecosystem (e.g., Whittaker 1975) and those used in the Convention on Biological Diversity include both biotic and abiotic components that interact ""as a functional unit"" (CBD 1992). Under this definition ecosystems occupy a defined geographic area and can be nested within other, larger ecosystems, with the largest ecosystem of all being the biosphere. Following a principal division by abiotic factors (terrestrial, freshwater, marine), most authorities, for example, recognize 15 terrestrial biomes (e.g., tundra, boreal forests, temperate grasslands) (Millennium Ecosystem Assessment 2005a). Ecoregions are subdivisions of biomes defined by the biogeographic patterns of their biota (Olson et al. 2001). Most units of practical interest for evaluation, however, may occur at extents smaller than biomes and ecoregions. For example, the terrestrial ecosystems of the conterminous United States are defined by internally consistent characteristics of species composition, vegetation structure, climate, and landform (Sayre et al. 2009). Similar groupings of ecosystems are applicable to freshwater and marine systems (Spalding et al. 2007; Abell et al. 2008). In some cases, a focus on biological components may be essential for assessing the risk that ecosystems are degraded or ultimately eliminated. For example, in terrestrial ecosystems not threatened by mining or other activities likely to produce changes in abiotic factors, this focus is likely to result in the use of ecosystem as a generic term for ecological communities or for sets of relatively distinct assemblages of species that co-occur in space and time in association with particular abiotic features (Christensen et al. 1996; McPeek & Miller 1996; Jennings et al. 2009; Keith 2009; Master et al. 2009). For many terrestrial ecosystems, as well as some aquatic ones, land-cover classification may be the most practical approach for delineating units for assessment (e.g., Benson 2006; Rodríguez et al. 2007). In some freshwater (Sowa et al. 2007) and most pelagic and deepwater marine systems (Roff & Taylor 2000), the delineation of assessment units may rely more heavily on abiotic features. For example, freshwater systems could be examined following a hierarchical riverine classification system (Sowa et al. 2007), whereas deepwater marine systems could be categorized by geophysical variables such as depth, slope, and substrate (Roff & Taylor 2000). To construct useful units for ecosystem assessment, the selection of variables should be informed by empirically demonstrated relations with species composition. Because a unified worldwide delimitation of ecosystems is unlikely to occur in the near future (Rodwell et al. 1995; Scholes et al. 2008) and because conservation policy is developed and applied at multiple scales (Watson 2005), we believe the focus must remain on developing criteria for status assessment that are applicable to diverse ecosystem classifications. Delimiting ecosystems is complex, but defining threat levels for ecosystems and determining the trajectory toward their loss may be even more so. As composite entities, ecosystems may be considered ""eliminated"" when only one key component (such as top predators or keystone pollinators) is lost or, at the other extreme, when the last biotic element is lost. We believe the scientific community needs to focus on developing a pragmatic, standardized approach intermediate between these extremes (i.e., Rodríguez et al. 2007). Elimination will usually be a gradual process; losses of species and ecosystem functions will lag behind declines in loss of area (Lindenmayer & Fischer 2006). Aquatic systems present challenges because ecosystem conversion and loss of function may be widespread but not easily detectable (Millennium Ecosystem Assessment 2005b; Nel et al. 2007). The assessment system must reflect changes over policy-relevant time scales (e.g., years to a century); thus, critical signposts need to be developed that indicate status and threats en route to ecosystem elimination, just as have been developed for species (Mace et al. 2008; Keith 2009). Because direct measurement of the level of threat to ecosystems and species is costly and difficult, assessments need to use surrogate measures of risk, or ""criteria"" (Mace et al. 2008), that are related to risk consistently across a range of ecosystem types. As in the case of species red lists (IUCN 2010a), ecosystems should be assessed relative to all criteria but need to meet only one criterion for listing under a ""threatened"" category (Fig. 1). A logical starting point for these criteria in ecosystems, already incorporated into many existing ecosystem-assessment protocols, is the IUCN Red List for Threatened Species (IUCN 2010a; Table 1). Because ecosystems in part are composed of species, criteria that apply to species may partly apply to ecosystems. Furthermore, the present system for assessing species is based on well-established scientific theory and empirical results and has been tested extensively (Mace et al. 2008). Criteria for assessing ecosystems should therefore be consistent with those for species, but may need to be adapted to accommodate relevant ecosystem theory (e.g., Scheffer et al. 2001). The process of ecosystem-extinction risk assessment. Ecosystem data on one or more quantitative proxy risk indicators (criteria) are evaluated against thresholds to assign a threat category (critically endangered [CR], endangered [EN], or vulnerable [VU]) to the ecosystem. In the case of species, assessment criteria are derived from estimates of geographical distribution, abundance, and their temporal trends (IUCN 2001; Mace et al. 2008). Thus, the process of ecosystem assessment could begin by estimating an ecosystem's geographical distribution and degree of degradation and temporal trends in these variables (Table 1; Fig. 1). In terrestrial systems, temporal trends in the distribution of land cover have been proposed and applied as criteria for assessing the status of some types of ecosystems (Benson 2006; Reyers et al. 2007; Rodríguez et al. 2007). For example, the Cape Flats Sand Fynbos, in southwestern South Africa, is listed as critically endangered because the expansion of Cape Town has resulted in a reduction of over 84% of the original extent of the ecosystem (Reyers et al. 2007; SANBI & DEAT 2009). Methods for extrapolating the historical distributions of ecosystems continue to be developed and improved (e.g., Rhemtulla et al. 2009; Morgan et al. 2010) and will undoubtedly aid the application of distribution-based criteria. Nevertheless, the abundance and trend-based criteria used presently for species assessments may lose meaning in the context of ecosystems (which do not simply consist of ""individuals"") because in ecosystems changes in spatial extent represent the endpoint of processes such as structural conversion and functional decline. Therefore, additional criteria are needed to standardize reliable measures of ecological function (Table 1) for which threats may be assessed in at least three dimensions: immediacy, scope, and severity (Master et al. 2009). For example, clear-cutting a forest may represent functional loss that is immediate, widespread, and severe, and may lead to irreversible changes in ecosystem composition, structure, and function, including regime shifts and permanent declines in geographical distribution of the ecosystem (Scheffer et al. 2001). In this context, indicators of functional loss may include specific measures of threat (e.g., increases in the proportion of invasive species or pollutant levels), measures of structure (e.g., changes in species richness, trophic configuration, or guild diversity or status of particular keystone species, such as seed dispersers or pollinators), or measures of function (e.g., changes in nutrient cycling, trophic complexity, energy flows, biomass accumulation, or patterns of water flow) (Nel et al. 2007; Nicholson et al. 2009). For example, in New South Wales, Artesian Mound Springs is listed as an endangered ecological community because its artesian aquifers have been largely depleted, not because its geographical extent has been changed (Benson et al. 2006; New South Wales Government 2009). Integrating the challenges and existing research outlined above, then, our proposed system combines measures of geographical distribution, ecological function, and their temporal trends over short and long periods in a manner analogous to the assessment of species for the IUCN Red List and results in four criteria (Table 1): rate of recent decline (in distribution or function); total historical decline (in distribution or function); limited current distribution with ongoing decline (in distribution or function); and very limited distribution without ongoing decline. Once criteria have been resolved, a further task will be quantifying thresholds for each criterion that reflect different levels of risk (i.e., vulnerable, endangered, critically endangered; Fig. 1) across ecosystem types and spatial scales. Again, these thresholds may be based on IUCN Red List thresholds for species, but must accommodate relevant ecosystem theory (Table 1). Species-area relations, for example, may inform the definition of thresholds for criteria on the basis of changes in geographical distribution, as has been done in South Africa (Desmet & Cowling 2004; Reyers et al. 2007) and other regions (Nicholson et al. 2009). These and other basic ecological principles from island biogeography and metapopulation theory allowed the assessment of threats to tropical dry forests in Venezuela. This assessment applied thresholds in land-cover loss and the rate of change in land cover across multiple spatial scales (Rodríguez et al. 2008). Although the theoretical basis of extrapolating species-area relations to risk assessment has been questioned (Ibáñez et al. 2006), these examples demonstrate the type of theoretically grounded approach that may produce robust thresholds for assessing risks to ecosystems at multiple scales. Developing thresholds for loss of ecological function may require more complex criteria to reflect variation in immediacy, scope, and severity (Master et al. 2009), such that severe, widely distributed, and ongoing loss of function leads to assignments to the highest levels of threat (Table 1). For example, an ecosystem would be considered critically endangered if it were to experience a severe decline in function over a large portion of its distribution (>80%) and the threatening process was ongoing or expected to commence in the near term (Table 1). Lower risk levels, such as ""endangered,"" could be assigned if the decline in function was equally severe, but the extent was less. By presenting preliminary, relatively simple criteria and thresholds (Table 1; Fig. 1), we do not imply that arriving at a final, unified system for assessment of ecosystem risk will be easy; in addition to the conceptual challenges, there are methodological and logistical issues to confront. For example, what is the best method for measuring the geographical distribution of an ecosystem? Or, how does one precisely define a location? The IUCN produces periodically updated, detailed guidelines for addressing these methodological questions in reference to species (IUCN 2010b). We expect that the development of analogous guidelines for ecosystems will be a major component of the consultation process that will take place over the next few years. Nearly 15 years passed between the initial development of criteria for the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species and their official adoption (Mace et al. 2008). To minimize delay in the adoption of such criteria for ecosystems, it will be crucial to formulate a unified proposal for criteria and thresholds and make this proposal available online in scientific and popular venues. Protocols will need to be tested in a broad set of institutional contexts, geographical regions, and ecosystem types, and the protocols will need to be useful at local and global scales. The institutional capacity of IUCN and other participating organizations will need strengthening to implement such a global assessment of ecosystem risk. It is important to differentiate ecosystem risk assessment—a scientific, technical activity—from priority setting, a fundamentally societal, value-laden activity (Possingham et al. 2002; Lamoreux et al. 2003; Miller et al. 2006; Mace et al. 2008). As species red lists have demonstrated, transparent, objective, and scientifically based assessments are prerequisites for sound policy and planning (Mace et al. 2008). To ensure the scientifically credible application of criteria in red listing of ecosystems, case studies are needed to show how risk assessments can inform priority-setting efforts. Although the scientific and logistical challenges to developing criteria for an ecosystem red list are substantial, we believe the time is right to do so. Current opportunities include ongoing assessments at local and global scales, a strong IUCN mandate from governments and the conservation community, public concern worldwide about ecosystems and human dependence on them, a rich experience with the species red-listing process, and continuing and massive improvements in data collection and computing power. What remains is to engage the world's conservation and ecosystem scientists in this task. We are grateful to R. Akçakaya, E. Fleishman, S.

In contrast to northern polar areas, the dipteran fauna of Antarctica is depauperate, with only two naturally occurring species of Chironomidae. Surprisingly little is known of the biology of these species. One, Parochlus steinenii, reaches the southern limit of a distribution covering the high Andes, Tierra del Fuego, South Georgia and the South Shetland Islands in the maritime Antarctic. The other, Belgica antarctica, is endemic to the maritime Antarctic. What factors influence the distribution and past colonisation of these two species in the Antarctic?
Distributional data and evidence from an accidental introduction of a third chironomid (Eretmoptera murphyi) suggest that difficulty of colonisation is the major factor limiting the number of dipteran species present in the maritime Antarctic. Other sub-Antarctic species are likely to be preadapted to more rigorous conditions, should natural or man-induced colonisation opportunities occur.
Evidence from physiological and ecological studies identify adaptations which allow these two species to survive in the harsh terrestrial environment of Antarctica. Life history characteristics of all three species include flexibility in development rates and size achieved, and the ability to continue activity at low positive temperatures. The distribution of the endemic B. antarctica is probably limited by the availability of suitable moist, vegetated, habitats and its brachyptery, rather than biological constraints directly, whereas the southern distribution of P. steinenii may be temperature-limited. Competition does not appear to be an important factor in the biology and ecology of either species, or in Antarctic terrestrial ecosystems generally.

",,,,"My office doesn't have a window. If it did, and I could look across campus, my view would be a mosaic of buildings, grass, trees, parking areas, a couple of small streams, and even a lake. There are oak trees with diverse Cynipid assemblages, a myriad of arthropods in the litter beneath the ornamental plantings, and abundant pollinators on the Hypericum that lines the path from my office to the library. There are also diesel-belching buses and some insane planner's nightmare of one-way roads and dead-end footpaths. As a microcosm of the world at large, our campus is a study in fragmentation. Areas of natural, semi-natural, and grossly artificial vegetation are divided and subdivided into patches of various sizes in various degrees of isolation. Boundaries abound. A demented four-year-old with Lego® could not create a three-dimensional architecture this complex. Yet within this fragmented landscape, insects persist in some abundance and diversity. As insect ecologists, we're obligated to understand the processes that influence the abundance, richness and diversity of insects in fragmented landscapes. As pest managers, we need to know how the architecture of landscapes influences pest population dynamics and their interactions with natural enemies and agents of control. As conservation biologists, we must develop strategies to maintain focal insect species, faunal diversity and the trophic interactions that drive key ecosystem processes. Whatever our entomological interests, landscape structure and habitat fragmentation have an influence on the ecology of the insects that we study. If space is the final frontier of ecological theory (Kareiva, 1994), then fragmentation of space is the warp engine that drives research in spatial ecology. Critical issues such as local extinction of bird populations (Renjifo, 2001; Robinson et al., 2001; Sekercioglu et al., 2002), declining densities of small mammals and herpetofauna (Maisonneuve & Rioux, 2001), declines in pollinator bees due to deforestation (Brown & Albrecht, 2001; Cane, 2001) and the management of landscapes for insect biodiversity (Ehrlich & Murphy, 1987; Samways, 1992; Thomas, 1995; Di Giulio et al., 2001) catch the imaginations of scientists and the public alike. There is a growing sense of urgency and awareness that understanding the role of habitat fragmentation in ecological processes is a prerequisite for sound science, policy and management. Whether the goal is to predict the presence and abundance of species in fragmented landscapes (Cowley et al., 2000), or to conserve species interactions and trophic structure (Fisher, 1998), the behavioural and dynamical responses of insects to landscape structure are key. The features of landscapes that influence the population and community ecology of species, including insects, are well known. The ratio of habitat edge to interior (Chen et al., 1995; Radeloff et al., 2000), the isolation of habitat fragments (Collinge, 2000), patch area (Kruess & Tscharntke, 2000), patch quality (Hunter et al., 1996; Kuussaari et al., 2000; Hanski & Singer, 2001), patch diversity (Gathmann et al., 1994; Varchola & Dunn, 2001) and microclimate (Braman et al., 2000) all contribute to determining the abundance and richness of insects on landscapes. More recently, ecologists have incorporated temporal changes in landscape structure (Solbreck, 1995; Onstad et al., 2001), genetic change in insect populations (Singer & Thomas, 1996; Ronce & Kirkpatrick, 2001), and differential responses of predators and prey (Kruess & Tscharntke, 1994; With et al., 2002) into their understanding of the spatial ecology of insects. Even with a growing awareness of the features of landscapes that contribute to variation in insect populations and communities, there remain clear gaps in our understanding of the links between landscape change and insect dynamics. Below, I describe some of the recent work that has explored these links and suggest some approaches for future work. Much can be learned about the impacts of fragmentation on insect populations by studying the movement of predators and prey among patch types in complex landscapes (Holland & Luff, 2000; Martin et al., 2001; With et al., 2002). Simple models assume that rates of movement are independent of landscape structure, typically assume constant movement rates whatever the landscape mosaic in question (Goodwin & Fahrig, 2002), and generally assume that dispersal is random (Conradt et al., 2001). In reality, movement rates can vary markedly among features of the landscape such as edges and boundaries, and simple diffusion models are unlikely to capture the movement of insects in fragmented habitats. For example, movement rates of the specialized goldenrod beetle, Trirhabda borealis, depend in part upon the patch structure of the environment within and among goldenrod fields (Goodwin & Fahrig, 2002). Similarly, the movement of carabid beetles within and among barley fields is reduced by the presence of hedgerows (Mauremooto et al., 1995). Although it is well established that field boundaries can act as reservoirs of predator populations, particularly those of carabid and staphylinid beetles (Andersen, 1997), the opposing effects of hedgerows on increasing predator densities and decreasing rates of movement may have complex effects upon prey densities. The apparent permeability of some habitat boundaries (Duelli et al., 1990) may be increased when beetles are hungry (Mauremooto et al., 1995), suggesting that the physiological state of individuals will influence their movement among landscape features. Of course, landscape features themselves can influence the physiological condition of insects, including carabid beetles (Oestman et al., 2001). It may be some time before we are able to incorporate 'insect health' into our understanding of landscape processes, but it is clear that the physiological condition of insects is both a product of landscape structure and a factor that influences responses to fragmentation. We need more studies that link insect physiology, landscape structure and rates of movement. Of course, nothing is simple and not all boundaries are created equal in time or space (Varchola & Dunn, 1999). Particularly in agricultural systems, boundaries can vary from complex strips of woodland, through hedgerows, to roads and simple grassy edges. Varchola & Dunn (2001) report that the relative effects of woody and grassy boundaries around agricultural fields on predatory beetle richness and activity vary depending upon the time of year. Woody edges appear to be important for over-wintering beetle populations, whereas later in the growing season grassy and woody edges are about equally important. However, corridors and boundaries around agricultural fields can actually increase the densities of pest species and cause reductions in yield. In soybean agroecosystems, fields surrounded by uncultivated corridors have been shown to support higher pest densities, to suffer higher levels of defoliation and to produce lower yields (Kemp & Barrett, 1989). Similarly, the diversity of herbivorous insects within alfalfa fields is positively related to the length of woody border surrounding fields (Holland & Fahrig, 2000). In other words, measuring the activity and richness of predator populations in field boundaries may not provide an adequate prediction of their impacts upon herbivores and the subsequent crop losses that fields may suffer. Boundary effects upon insect herbivores may be variable at least in part because edges may actually be more suitable habitat for some herbivores. For example, forest tent caterpillars feeding within stands of sugar maple perform better in habitat edges than in habitat interior (Fortin & Mauffette, 2001). Trees on the edge of forests appear to produce foliage with higher concentrations of nitrogen and soluble sugars, both of which are positively correlated with insect performance. As forest fragmentation proceeds, and the ratio of edge to interior rises, it is likely that the performance of forest tent caterpillars will improve. If conservation, rather than pest management, is the focus of your research, then there seems little doubt that complex boundaries among habitat types can act to increase insect diversity. For example, riparian buffer strips at the side of lakes and streams seem to concentrate flying insects. In comparison to intact forest, Whitaker et al. (2000) reported higher densities of flying insects in riparian buffer strips, possibly because the strips collect airborne insects by acting as windbreaks. Higher concentrations of flying insects are associated with higher densities of insectivorous birds. The matrix of unsuitable habitat between suitable habitat patches may have a profound influence on insect movement. In their studies of flea beetles, Aphthona, on leafy spurge, Jonsen et al. (2001) report that the quality of matrix habitat (grass vs. shrub) influences the ability of A. nigriscutis to colonize patches of host plant. Given that leafy spurge is a weed pest, colonization by its biological control agents is of significant economic concern. Movement patterns varied between beetle sexes and between congeneric beetles, suggesting that there may be no simple relationship between matrix quality and the effectiveness of the biological control agents (Jonsen et al., 2001). Variation among species in their responses to landscape structure and management practices seems to be a common feature of such studies (Banks, 1998; Zabel & Tscharntke, 1998; Braman et al., 2000; Collinge, 2000; Di Giulio et al., 2001). Studying the movement of particular species among isolated patches is important, but a critical question remains; can fine-scale movement behaviours be used to predict broad scale patterns of distribution on heterogeneous landscapes? According to Jonsen & Taylor (2000), the answer may be yes. In their studies of damselflies in the genus Calopteryx, they have developed simulation models in which fine-scale movement behaviours were useful in predicting landscape-level distributions. It is true that the models required incorporating information on the architecture of the landscape, but it is nonetheless reassuring that measurements of specific behaviours can lead to accurate predictions of distribution patterns. Specifically, the probability of crossing patch boundaries and the rates of movement within given habitat patches were important determinants of damselfly distributions. Within the genus Calopteryx, movement rates are related to the realized connectivity of different landscape features but differ among species within the genus (Pither & Taylor, 1998), demonstrating that connectivity is as much a feature of the biology of species as it is the structure of landscapes. This last point has also been made by Haslett (2001) in a study of Dipteran diversity at landscape scales. From the 'fly point of view' borders that we perceive may be neutral to some Diptera, and border complexity may be a more relevant metric. Given the importance of movement to the spatial ecology of insects, it should be no surprise that the size and physical arrangement of habitat patches on landscapes plays a fundamental role in determining the abundance and diversity of insect faunas. As in classic island biogeography theory (MacArthur & Wilson, 1967), patch area and patch isolation have often been associated with the richness of insect faunas (Kruess & Tscharntke, 1994; Steffan-Dewenter & Tscharntke, 2002). For example, Kruess & Tscharntke (2000) report that the species richness of seed-feeding insects on bush vetch (Vicia sepium) increase with the area of meadows that contain the host plant, and decrease with isolation of the patch. The real contribution of Tscharntke's group, however, has been to highlight the different spatial scales at which insect herbivores and natural enemies respond to patch structure. On bush vetch, the parasitoids of the seed-feeders suffered more from habitat loss and isolation than did their hosts. This suggests that the maintenance of higher trophic structure requires less fragmentation and isolation than does the maintenance of simple plant–insect assemblages (Kruess & Tscharntke, 2000). Similarly, in a study of herbivores and predators in patches of nettle plants, herbivore populations were affected primarily by patch area, whereas predator populations were affected primarily by patch isolation (Zabel & Tscharntke, 1998). The authors argue that maintaining connectivity is important to the maintenance of predator–prey interactions (Kruess & Tscharntke, 1994). In their study of Eucalyptus remnants in grazed landscapes, Abensperg-Traun & Smith (1999) reported that predatory species of arthropod generally required larger habitat patches than did arthropods at lower trophic levels. Their data generally support the view of Tscharntke's research group that predators are more vulnerable to fragmentation than are their prey. Ultimately, habitat fragmentation may lead to the truncation of food chains and the degradation of trophic structure. In old-growth forests in eastern Finland, for example, fragmentation reduces the richness of insect species associated with bracket fungi. Specifically, older fragments have a median food-chain length of one (only the fungus present), whereas large areas of old growth typically support food chains with three trophic levels (Komonen et al., 2000). In my view, the realization that food-chain length and trophic structure are so vulnerable to fragmentation is the most important lesson that we have learned from studying insects on complex landscapes. It has profound implications for many fields of ecology, evolutionary biology and management. Differential responses of predators and prey to landscape structure appear to hold when studies scale up to much larger areas. In a large-scale study of landscape structure and predator richness, Elliot et al. (1999) investigated the effects of landscape characteristics on the abundance and richness of predators of aphids in wheat fields in South Dakota. Using aerial photographs, they were able to demonstrate that increases in uncultivated land and increases in patchiness surrounding wheat fields were both associated with increasing abundance and richness in the predator communities within fields. Fragmentation, by decreasing the effectiveness of natural enemies, may therefore be associated with increases in the probability of insect outbreak. For example, the duration of forest tent caterpillar, Malacosoma disstria, outbreaks in Canada increases in response to forest fragmentation (Roland, 1993). Effects of fragmentation on both parasitoids (Roland & Taylor, 1997) and disease (Roland & Kaupp, 1995) have been implicated in their dynamics under landscape change. Finally, the age of habitat fragments may also influence both the occurrence of herbivores and their probability of parasitism (Athen & Tscharntke, 1999). Such age effects call for the inclusion of temporal patch structure into our understanding of insect ecology in fragmented habitats. Because this is ecology, exceptions do exist to the general relationships between patch area, patch isolation and species richness. For example, populations of pollinating bees seem much more attuned to the quality of patches than to their area or isolation (Gathmann et al., 1994; Tscharntke et al., 1998). In fact, for pollinators, management regimes that focus upon floral diversity appear to have a greater effect than those related to the arrangement of patches on the landscape, and the mobility of insect pollinators may make them less susceptible to fragmentation than some other insect groups (Cane, 2001). Nonetheless, concerns remain that fragmentation may adversely affect particular species of native pollinators. In Argentinean subtropical dry forest, for example, fragmentation reduces visitation by native bees but increases visitation by exotic honey bees (Aizen & Feinsinger, 1994). The perceived severity of fragmentation effects therefore depend upon whether the focus is on conservation of native species or on the ecosystem service of pollination. Finally, small and dispersed habitat fragments are known to increase beta diversity across some landscapes. Tscharntke et al. (2002) emphasize the importance of small habitat fragments for certain insect species and point out that, at least for some butterfly groups, small fragments support more species than do equivalent areas in large patches. For conservation purposes, they recommend a combination of large patches with scattered small fragments to maximize beta diversity. Given the effects of habitat fragmentation and isolation on predator–prey interactions, we might expect that landscape structure should play a role in the effectiveness of biological control. However, most recent studies of interactions between landscape features and pest management have focused upon habitat heterogeneity rather than area or isolation per se. For example, rates of parasitism of armyworm larvae are higher in complex agricultural landscapes than in simple landscapes (Marino & Landis, 1996). Similarly, parasitism of rape pollen beetles declines significantly with distance from field margins (Tscharntke et al., 2002). Complex landscapes may provide a diversity of basal resources that supplement populations of predators. This appears to occur in Indonesian rice fields, where the availability of detritus acts to supplement the food web and maintain high populations of generalist predators that suppress rice pests (Settle et al., 1996). Similarly, mulching of agricultural fields in southern Sweden has been shown to increase the densities of staphyilinid beetles (Raemert et al., 2001). However, relationships between pest damage and landscape structure are not simple. In some cases, there appear to be few changes in species richness along gradients of agricultural intensification (Burel et al., 1998) and, in at least one case, the richness of the insect community in agricultural fields actually increased with patch isolation (Fahrig & Jonsen, 1998). Some generalist spiders appear to exhibit preferences for agricultural habitat over less-disturbed habitat (Downie et al., 2000) and the degree of polyphagy of both predators and pests is likely to influence their response to changes in landscape structure (Jonsen & Fahrig, 1997). The bottom line is that complex landscapes beget complex interactions and it will require some clever manipulative experiments to untangle the often confounding effects of boundary quantity, boundary quality, matrix habitat, patch area and patch isolation on the biological control of insect pests. It has become a textbook paradigm that habitat corridors that connect isolated habitat patches will increase the abundance and diversity of species within those patches through increases in rates of immigration. How depressing, then, that there exist so few experimental studies in which both patch isolation and the presence of corridors have been manipulated to dissect their relative effects upon insect communities. In one such study (Collinge, 2000), the presence of corridors had relatively weak effects upon species loss and colonization of isolated patches by insects in native grassland. Weak effects of corridors on species richness were detected in medium-sized patches, but there were no overall effects upon rates of colonization. Critically, recolonization of patches by rare species was unaffected by the presence or absence of corridors. Variation in corridor effects among species and among years suggests that there exist few consistent effects of habitat corridors in this grassland system. Variability in the value of corridors seems to be a feature of the few careful studies that have been conducted. For example, in his exploration of movement by the butterfly Junonia coenia, Haddad (2000) reported that corridors promoted colonization of patches when butterflies were released at long distances from suitable habitat. At shorter distances, however, corridors were not effective at promoting colonization. Nonetheless, movement of butterflies among patches was significantly enhanced by the presence of corridors (Haddad, 1999a) and population densities were higher in connected patches than in isolated patches of similar area (Haddad & Baum, 1999). Haddad's (1999b) simulation models suggest that the movement behaviour of butterflies at patch-edge boundaries can be used to predict the effects of corridors on movement among patches. To be honest, there are simply too few experimental studies of corridor effects on insects to draw many conclusions at present. The only conclusion that I can draw is that we need to do more. Because of its focus upon the dynamics of single species occupying discrete patches of habitat, the concept of metapopulation dynamics has much to offer in studies of habitat fragmentation. Species living in highly fragmented landscapes often occur as metapopulations, in which local populations turn over quite frequently, but the metapopulation (the population of populations) tends to persist (Levins, 1969; Ehrlich & Murphy, 1987; Hanski, 1999). The rate of population turnover is generally related to factors such as population size and connectivity. However, patch quality may also be an important determinant of patch colonization and persistence (Hanski & Singer, 2001). For example, the Glanville fritillary butterfly, Melitaea cinxia, in Finland occurs in discrete habitat patches that contain two potential host-plant species, Plantago lanceolata and Veronica spicata (Kuussaari et al., 2000). The probability of an empty patch being colonized depends in part upon the perceived quality of that patch by ovipositing female butterflies. Colonization rates increase when surrounding patches contain butterflies that have experienced similar host-plant composition, suggesting that the prior experience of local butterflies influences their perception of habitat quality and their probability of colonizing a new patch (Hanski & Singer, 2001). Patch quality can also influence emigration rates. For example, emigration of the frugivorous butterfly, Hamadryas februa, from islands in Venezuela has been linked to the availability of suitable host-plant species (Shahabuddin et al., 2000). The incorporation of patch quality and female preference into studies of metapopulations represents a significant advance in the field and adds a level of reality to dynamics that was missing in earlier metapopulation studies (Hunter et al., 1996, 2000). Of course, issues of patch quality are central to complementary theories of insect population dynamics in fragmented landscapes, such as theories of source–sink dynamics (Pulliam, 1988). Source–sink dynamics are based upon high quality patches (births exceed deaths, emigration exceeds immigration) supporting populations in low quality patches (deaths exceed births, immigration exceeds emigration), so extending the distribution of organisms in space. As Boughton (1999) has pointed out, changes in patch quality and in rates of movement can result in interesting reversals in the status of sources and sinks. In other words, by focusing upon the quality of patches and the net movement of organisms, source–sink theory is sufficiently robust to incorporate the temporal changes in landscape structure that characterize our changing world. Using metapopulation or source–sink concepts, pest managers may be able to manipulate patch structure in time and space to influence the dynamics of pest species (Ives & Settle, 1997). Given their current place in conservation biology, it is ironic that metapopulation models were developed originally for pest management rather than species conservation (Levins, 1969). Uses of metapopulation theory in the arrangement of crop patches and in the timing of crop rotations have yet to realize their potential in pest management, perhaps because of the necessity of region-wide cooperation in the placement and rotation of crops (Helenius, 1997). Moreover, there exists potential conflict between metapopulation strategies that aim to reduce pest populations and those that aim to increase predator populations (Ives & Settle, 1997). The form and value of habitat patches in complex landscapes can vary dramatically over time (Solbreck, 1995), yet we know relatively little about the effects of temporal changes in spatial structure on insect populations. Much of what we do know about temporal effects of landscape change comes from studies of insect pests and predators under crop rotation. Crop rotation has traditionally been effective in reducing the damage by insect pests to particular crops. However, Onstad et al. (2001) have shown that frequent rotation may select for behavioural changes that ameliorate the negative impacts of landscape change on insect dynamics. Depending upon the diversity of the landscape and the frequency of rotation, selection may act to change patterns of movement or feeding preferences that mitigate the effects of landscape change. There is little doubt that adaptation is a pervasive evolutionary response to changing landscape features (Singer & Thomas, 1996). As Ronce & Kirkpatrick (2001) point out, even small changes in connectivity between two habitats can result in a 'migrational meltdown', during which population sizes drop and specialization on a single habitat-type evolves. Their models of the evolution of habitat generalists and habitat specialists suggest that migration rates, and hence connectivity, are critical to evolutionary change in heterogeneous landscapes (Ronce & Kirkpatrick, 2001) and may explain some patterns of genetic variation among insect populations in space (Kuussaari et al., 2000; Wilcock et al., 2001). Lack of movement and increasing specialization in local habitat patches has been implicated as a cause of inbreeding depression in some butterfly metapopulations (Haikola et al., 2001). There is even evidence that fragmentation can select for variation in dispersal abilities within species. For example, wing lengths, wing widths and thoracic weights of the forest damselfly Calopteryx maculata vary between populations along forested streams and those along streams through pastures (Taylor & Merriam, 1995). Selection appears to have increased flight ability within populations in fragmented pasture habitats. In fact, selection for strong dispersal ability, whatever its cause, is likely to reduce the impact of fragmentation upon the dynamics of insect species. The dynamics of some grass-feeding insects, for example, are dominated by the ephemeral availability of new grass shoots, and their dispersal abilities reflect the necessity of finding resources that vary markedly in space and time. As a consequence, their populations appear to be less affected by habitat fragmentation that those of some other herbivores (Dubbert et al., 1998). I have already mentioned a few areas of research that would benefit from further work, including an accurate assessment of corridor effects on insects (Collinge, 2000; Haddad, 2000), and the development of links among insect physiology, rates of movement and landscape structure. There are many others. First, it would be worthwhile to develop some rigorous and standard descriptions of both the processes of landscape change and the structures that result. The development of landscape mosaics is actually more complicated than the simple processes of fragmentation or change in land use. Collinge & Forman (1998) suggest that there are at least four processes that contribute to the generation of landscape mosaics; shrinkage, bisection, fragmentation and perforation. By subdividing mosaic formation in this way, Collinge & Forman (1998) were able to show that, in grassland habitats, shrinkage results in a decline in insect species richness, whereas fragmentation actually increases species richness. Whatever 'taxonomy' of landscape structure that we develop, a common language and standard methods would go far in promoting synthesis among disparate studies (Duelli et al., 1999). Second, we need to strike a balance between correlative and mechanistic approaches. Manipulative experiments are ideal for studying patterns of movement and other critical population rates at local scales. They are invaluable for understanding the complexities of mosaic formation and dissecting out covariation among landscape traits (Banks, 1998; Collinge & Forman, 1998; Golden & Crist, 2000). However, we also need more emphasis on research at larger spatial scales (Steffan-Dewenter & Tscharntke, 2002), which will undoubtedly rely in part on correlations and modelling. By combining both experimental approaches at local scales and correlative approaches across larger scales, it may be possible to explain some of the inconsistencies that occur in the literature. For example, populations of jack pine budworm (Choristoneura pinus pinus) are positively correlated with the density of habitat edge during population increase, but negatively correlated with the same landscape feature during population decrease (Radeloff et al., 2000). This contradictory result will only be explained by studies of mechanism at the local level. Third, we need to make much more use of the historical data that are available to us. Both amateur and professional entomologists have generated a plethora of records on the distribution and abundance of species over many decades of collecting. In combination with historical records of land use change, such data should provide us with considerable insight into how past landscape change has influenced our current insect fauna and how future change may affect it further. Using insect fossils, we can delve back even further and explore the fascinating long-term changes in insect fauna recorded in the fossil record (Schwert, 1996). For example, in north-eastern Iowa, the beetle fauna prior to Euro-American settlement was characterized by a diverse assemblage of carabids (terrestrial) and elmids (aquatic). After settlement and intensive cultivation, the dominant fauna has been replaced by weed and crop weevils and by dung beetles, with degradation of the aquatic elmids. The changes in north-eastern Iowa parallel changes in British sites during the late Bronze age where, 2100 years ago, insect faunas were affected by the transformation of natural landscapes to agrarian use (Schwert, 1996). Finally, we need to explore in much greater detail the effects of landscape change and habitat fragmentation on ecological interactions. We have learned a considerable amount by studying landscape effects on the abundance of species and the richness of communities. However, the most profound effects of habitat fragmentation may result from changes in interactions among species. For example, the loss of keystone species in communities may result in cascading effects through trophic webs that ultimately influence ecosystem processes (Tscharntke, 1992; Didham et al., 1996; Fisher, 1998; Komonen et al., 2000; Gibbs & Stanton, 2001). We need to know the general effects that losses in insect biomass have on higher trophic levels such as insectivorous birds (Van Wilgenburg et al., 2001). We need to explore the interactive effects of multiple environmental changes such as global warming (Hill et al., 1999) or species invasions (Toft et al., 2001) along with habitat fragmentation. Invasion by the weed Tradescantia fluminensis into fragmented forests in New Zealand has caused a decline in fungus fly and beetle diversity in the forest understory (Toft et al., 2001), presumably because of replacement of the natural forest flora. This is a clear example of two interacting factors − fragmentation and the invasion of exotics − influencing trophic dynamics within forests. Insects dwell within complex ecosystems and interact with other taxonomic groups and the abiotic environment. The true effects of landscape change and fragmentation upon the ecology of insects will only be understood by embracing the ecological complexity that characterizes the world within which insects live. I thank the National Science Foundation (Grant DEB-9906366) for supporting our work on habitat gradients and the population dynamics of insect herbivores.

Specialization on one host species and distribution across many hosts were both rare. Geographic patterns of parasite lineages indicated limited dispersal and frequent local extinction. The central islands of the archipelago share similar parasite lineages and patterns of infection. However, the peripheral islands harbor well‐differentiated parasite communities, indicating long periods of isolation. Nonetheless, 20 of 26 parasite lineages were recovered from at least one of three other geographic regions, the Greater Antilles, North America, and South America, suggesting rapid dispersal relative to rate of differentiation. Six parasite lineages were restricted to the Lesser Antilles, primarily to endemic host species. Host differences between populations of the same parasite lineage suggest that host preference may evolve more rapidly than mitochondrial gene sequences. Taken together, distributions of avian malarial parasites reveal evidence of coevolution, host switching, extinction, and periodic recolonization events resulting in ecologically dynamic as well as evolutionarily stable patterns of infection.","0003-0147

",,,,"Abstract Aim The conservation value of sites is often based on species richness ( SR ). However, metrics of phylogenetic diversity ( PD ) reflect a community's evolutionary potential and reveal the potential for additional conservation value above that based purely on SR . Although PD is typically correlated with SR , localized differences in this relationship have been found in different taxa. Here, we explore geographical variation in global avian PD . We identify where PD is higher or lower than expected (from SR ) and explore correlates of those differences, to find communities with high irreplaceability, in terms of the uniqueness of evolutionary histories. Location Global terrestrial. Methods Using comprehensive avian phylogenies and global distributional data for all extant birds, we calculated SR and Faith's PD , a widely applied measure of community PD , across the terrestrial world. We modelled the relationship between avian PD for terrestrial birds and its potential environmental correlates. Analyses were conducted at a global scale and also for individual biogeographical realms. Potential explanatory variables of PD included SR , long‐term climate stability, climatic diversity (using altitudinal range as a proxy), habitat diversity and proximity to neighbouring realms. Results We identified areas of high and low relative PD ( rPD ; PD relative to that expected given SR ). Areas of high rPD were associated with deserts and islands, while areas of low rPD were associated with historical glaciation. Our results suggest that rPD is correlated with different environmental variables in different parts of the world. Main conclusions There is geographical variation in avian rPD , much of which can be explained by putative drivers. However, the importance of these drivers shows pronounced regional variation. Moreover, the variation in avian rPD differs substantially from patterns found for mammals and amphibians. We suggest that PD adds additional insights about the irreplaceability of communities to conventional metrics of biodiversity based on SR , and could be usefully included in assessments of site valuation and prioritization.

",,,,"The composition of the terrestrial Antarctic flora and fauna and the distribution patterns of a number of species and of the principal vegetation types is now reasonably well established, at least in outline, for the Antarctic Peninsula region and the areas about McMurdo Sound as well as for some areas around the coastal ranges of East Antarctica. Detailed research at Signy Island has provided information concerning the biomass and productivity of certain vegetation types, decomposer organisms, microbivores, and invertebrate herbivores and predators. The main pathways of energy and nutrient within the terrestrial study sites can be regarded as reasonably established. Net annual production locally reaches very high levels (up to 800 g m-2). Only a tiny part of this productivity is consumed by herbivores, the greater part passing to the decomposers or persisting as peat. Most of the animals are microbivores, or graze on fungi, and in turn sustain the small number of invertebrate predators. Analysis of the range of habitats even on Signy Island indicates however that the sites for which detailed ecological information is available represent only a part of the range of environmental and ecological variation. The island is in fact characterized by a very high level of within-site diversity, some of it on a very small scale. Similarly, recent research which permits ecological comparisons with the sub-Antarctic islands of South Georgia and Macquarie, and with the McMurdo area, confirms that Signy Island displays only a small part of the very large range of diversity within the Antarctic regions as a whole. It is a reasonably representative sample of the maritime Antarctic zone in the Antarctic Peninsula region where conditions are particularly favourable for terrestrial life. Its ecological features resemble most closely those of the South Shetland Islands (except over permeable volcanic rocks) and the Palmer Archipelago on the western side of the Antarctic Peninsula. Very different plant and animal communities occur over much of the McMurdo Sound region and in the inland ranges of East Antarctica. Some general statements can now be made about the relationships between terrestrial Antarctic eco-systems and climatic, edaphic and historical factors. There is a clearly marked attenuation of the vegetation and fauna and simplification of the ecological systems as one moves towards cold, arid continental conditions. But the biota of the maritime Antarctic and the sub-Antarctic islands is more impoverished than ecological factors alone would indicate, because of the isolation of these land habitats, many of which have only recently been deglaciated. If present environmental conditions persist, a slow increase in the complexity of these ecological systems is to be expected and in some areas, especially the subantarctic islands, this process is being accelerated by human influence.

",,,,"Field surveys of free-living terrestrial microarthropods were made during the 1994–95 summer at four sites in northern Marguerite Bay (Anchorage Island, Lagoon Island, Léonie Island, Rothera Point; c. 68°S, 68°W) and three on southern Alexander Island (Two Step Cliffs, Fossil Bluff, Ablation Valley; c. 71–72°S, 68°W). Detailed site descriptions are presented, as little previous information exists. Twenty species (four Collembola, 16 Acari) were recorded from the Marguerite Bay sites, with a maximum of 17 species at one site. A further four species (one Collembola, two Acari, one Diptera) have been recorded from the same area by other authors. Species diversity at these sites, in particular Léonie Island, is as great as at any known site elsewhere in the maritime Antarctic, although the total area of terrestrial habitat available is small. Individual species and total population densities are also similar to, if not greater than, published studies from the South Shetland and South Orkney Islands. None of the species is new to the maritime Antarctic, although the distributions of several are extended southwards. Only nine species (maximum seven at one site) were found on Alexander Island, concurrent with decreases in population densities to levels similar to those found in many continental Antarctic studies. This still represents a high species diversity for such a high latitude site. The richness of two sites, Ablation Valley and Mars Oasis (Two Step Cliffs), is unlikely to be repeated elsewhere on Alexander Island. The Alexander Island fauna is clearly related to that of the maritime Antarctic, as all except one species occur at more northerly sites elsewhere on the Antarctic Peninsula, and none in the continental Antarctic. One species, Friesia topo (Collembola), is known only from Alexander Island.

",,,,"Understanding patterns of among‐island variation in species richness has long been an important question in ecology and biogeography. However, despite the clear spatial nature of the data used for such investigations, the spatial distribution of the different sampled locations is rarely explicitly considered, which may be critical for statistical and biological reasons. In a recent study, Chown et al. (1998) investigated the relationships between species richness of different indigenous and introduced taxonomic groups and a variety of variables characterizing Southern Ocean islands, and here, we use these data to address spatial issues. As predicted, we found spatial autocorrelation in species richness for terrestrial taxa with high dispersal ability or for terrestrial taxa that had time to disperse locally (introduced land birds and indigenous taxa) but not for taxa that had low opportunity to disperse to nearby islands (introduced plants, insects, and mammals), which suggests that colonization from nearby islands has played an important role in shaping present‐day patterns of among‐island variation in species richness. Interestingly, in several cases, the estimated effect of variables changed when spatial covariance was incorporated. Moreover, the absence of autocorrelation of some variables allowed us to confirm some important results of Chown et al. (1998), notably those involving the potential impact of human presence on the biodiversity of these islands. Overall, our results illustrate the importance of considering spatial structures in ecological studies. This is notably the case when dispersal processes can be expected to explain some of the observed patterns.","0003-0147

",,,,"The effect of resource subsidies on recipient food webs has received much recent attention. The purpose of this study was to measure the effects of significant seasonal seaweed deposition events, caused by hurricanes and other storms, on species inhabiting subtropical islands. The seaweed represents a pulsed resource subsidy that is consumed by amphipods and flies, which are eaten by lizards and predatory arthropods, which in turn consume terrestrial herbivores. Additionally, seaweed decomposes directly into the soil under plants. We added seaweed to six shoreline plots and removed seaweed from six other plots for three months; all plots were repeatedly monitored for 12 months after the initial manipulation. Lizard density (Anolis sagrei) responded rapidly, and the overall average was 63% higher in subsidized than in removal plots. Stable-isotope analysis revealed a shift in lizard diet composition toward more marine-based prey in subsidized plots. Leaf damage was 70% higher in subsidized than in removal plots after eight months, but subsequent damage was about the same in the two treatments. Foliage growth rate was 70% higher in subsidized plots after 12 months. Results of a complementary study on the relationship between natural variation in marine subsidies and island food web components were consistent with the experimental results. We suggest two causal pathways for the effects of marine subsidies on terrestrial plants: (1) the “fertilization effect” in which seaweed adds nutrients to plants, increasing their growth rate, and (2) the “predator diet shift effect” in which lizards shift from eating local prey (including terrestrial herbivores) to eating mostly marine detritivores.","0012-9658

",,,,"The diversity of body sizes of organisms has traditionally been explained in terms of microevolutionary processes: natural selection owing to differential fitness of individual organisms, or to macroevolutionary processes: species selection owing to the differential proliferation of phylogenetic lineages. Data for terrestrial mammals and birds indicate that even on a logarithmic scale frequency distributions of body mass among species are significantly skewed towards larger sizes. We used simulation models to evaluate the extent to which macro- and microevolutionary processes are sufficient to explain these distributions. Simulations of a purely cladogenetic process with no bias in extinction or speciation rates for different body sizes did not produce skewed log body mass distributions. Simulations that included size-biased extinction rates, especially those that incorporated anagenetic size change within species between speciation and extinction events, regularly produced skewed distributions. We conclude that although cladogenetic processes probably play a significant role in body size evolution, there must also be a significant anagenetic component. The regular variation in the form of mammalian body size distributions among different-sized islands and continents suggests that environmental conditions, operating through both macro- and microevolutionary processes, determine to a large extent the diversification of body sizes within faunas. Macroevolution is not decoupled from microevolution.

Much research has been dedicated towards understanding historic and current changes in alien species distribution and impacts on islands and potential changes under future climate change. However, projections of how alien species richness and impacts on islands might develop in the future are still lacking. In the absence of reliable projections, expert-based assessments are a valuable tool to investigate the importance of different drivers and pathways and the distributions of potential impacts of future biological invasions. These insights can guide subsequent quantification efforts and inform invasive species management and policy. In this study, we performed a survey among 126 experts in invasion science ranging from scientists to managers and decision makers with a focus on island systems until the mid-21st century. The survey revealed that out of 15 drivers, six were considered important by almost all respondents (>90%). Of these, trade & transport was identified as most important at the introduction stage (99.2%) and land use/cover change as most important at the establishment (96.8%) and spread (95.2%) stage. Additionally, the experts considered that alien species were more likely to be introduced (93.7%) and spread (78.6%) as stowaways than through any other pathway. In general, respondents agreed that the impacts of alien species will increase on all types of islands, particularly on oceanic islands, followed by atolls and continental islands. Within islands, terrestrial ecosystems were assumed to be impacted more severely than marine ecosystems. Finally, the survey hints towards the potential for effective communication, scientific research and increased pro-active management of alien species on islands to reduce their future consequences. Given the major threat represented by invasive alien species on islands, these results provide crucial insights relevant for global and regional conservation efforts.

",,,,"Avoidance and tolerance are the two means by which plants cope with herbivores. Avoidances internal to the plant, such as morphology, chemical repellants, thorns, etc., have received considerable attention in the plant-herbivore literature, but relatively little consideration has been given to avoidances external to the plant. We develop a conceptual framework of external plant avoidances of herbivory based on foraging selection impedances (associational avoidances), behavioral impedances (indirect avoidances), and physical impedances (refuges) organized along axes of efficiency, degree of protection, and necessity of tolerance characteristics. Associational avoidances are uncommon for terrestrial mammalian herbivores compared to plant-insect or marine situations. Indirect avoidances mediated through herbivore territoriality, predator avoidance, and other behaviors independent of foraging decisions are probably common in nature, but few have been formally documented. Biotic and geologic refuges providing a physical impedance are the only avoidances shown to have implications for plant biodiversity. This is particularly true for geologic refuges, where there is not a tradeoff between competition and the refuge effect. Small geologic refuges (rock outcrops, cliffs, etc.) are more likely to also positively or negatively alter associated plant microenvironments than large geologic refuges (mesas, islands, etc.). In a survey, 86% of small refuge studies reported positive effects on plant diversity compared to 50% for large refuges. Geologic refuges in more productive environments were more important in protecting diversity than refuges in less productive, semiarid environments, and the effects of protection were greater in communities with short compared to long evolutionary histories of grazing. Other characteristics of refuges such as extent across the landscape and the manner they alter or ameliorate the environment, as well as characteristics of the herbivore such as small or large, generalist or specialist may also determine the effectiveness of refuges, but there are too few studies to assess these factors.","0030-1299

",,,,"Throughout the Southern Hemisphere many terrestrial taxa have circum-Antarctic distributions. This pattern is generally attributed to ongoing dispersal (by wind, water, or migrating birds) or relict Gondwanan distributions. Few of these terrestrial taxa have extant representatives in Antarctica, but such taxa would contribute to our understanding of the evolutionary origins of the continental Antarctic fauna. Either these taxa have survived the harsh climate cooling in Antarctica over the last 23 Myr (Gondwanan/vicariance origin) or they have dispersed there more recently (<2 MYA). In this context, we examined mtDNA (COI) sequence variation in Cryptopygus and related extant Antarctic and subantarctic terrestrial springtails (Collembola). Sequence divergence was estimated under a maximum likelihood model (general time reversible + I + Γ) between individuals from subantarctic islands, Australia, New Zealand, Patagonia, Antarctic Peninsula, and continental Antarctica. Recent dispersal/colonization (<2 MYA) of Cryptopygus species was inferred between some subantarctic islands, and there was a close association between estimated times of divergences based on a molecular clock and proposed geological ages of islands. Most lineages generally grouped according to geographic proximity or by inferred dispersal/colonization pathways. In contrast, the deep divergences found for the four endemic Antarctic species indicate that they represent a continuous chain of descent dating from the break up of Gondwana to the present. We suggest that the diversification of these springtail species (21–11 MYA) in ice-free glacial refugia throughout the Trans-Antarctic Mountains was caused by the glaciation of the Antarctic continent during the middle to late Miocene.

The average height of the trees correlated positively with the number of strictly terrestrial species but negatively with shore species. The difference between the number of strictly terrestrial species, predicted from the multiple regression equation, and that observed was proportionally larger on smaller islands. There was evidence that plant species carried by animals dispersed less efficiently to the islands. The flora contained proportionally fewer of these species with decreasing island area.

Six biogeographical districts were recognized for the East Asian freshwater crabs based on similarity of distribution: (I) Hengduanshan Area, including Yunnan and Tibet; (II) Karst Area of Guizhou; (III) Yangtze River Basin, extending to Yellow River basin, with three subdivisions; (IV) Wuyishan Area and Pearl River Basin in Southeast and South China; (V) Hainan Island; and (VI) East Asian Islands, with subdivisions of Taiwan, Ryukyus and mainland Japan. The most diverse genera are the potamids Sinopotamon (84 species) and Geothelphusa (54 species), as well as the gecarcinucid Somanniathelphusa (27 species). Yunnan has the highest species richness (48 species) and diversity (Shannon index 2.21) in continental China, while Taiwan has the highest species richness (42 species) of the island systems. The distribution of the species of the potamid Sinopotamon and other genera along China's longest drainage, the Yangtze River, can be subdivided into several zones corresponding to the upper, middle and lower reaches of the river basin. The freshwater crab fauna of continental China, the East Asian islands and Hainan Island were all different from each other, and this finding agreed with the findings of molecular phylogenetic studies. The distribution of freshwater crabs in the Yangtze River showed a similar pattern with other freshwater organisms in this drainage. The present biogeographical interpretation contrasts sharply with the traditional zoogeographical patterns proposed that are based on Chinese terrestrial vertebrates. The present analyses of crab distributions suggest that Yunnan is a possible centre of origin for the Potamidae of China and perhaps the whole of East Asia. The freshwater crab species richness in Yunnan is probably the result of its generally warmer climate, more diverse habitats and a long history of cladogenesis.","1477-2000

",,,,"ABSTRACT Aim To provide the first comparative overview on the current numbers of alien species that invade representative European terrestrial and freshwater habitats for a range of taxonomic groups. Location Europe. Methods Numbers of naturalized alien species of plants, insects, herptiles, birds and mammals occurring in 10 habitats defined according to the European Nature Information System (EUNIS) were obtained from 115 regional data sets. Only species introduced after ad 1500 were considered. Data were analysed by ANCOVA and regression trees to assess whether differences exist among taxonomic groups in terms of their habitat affinity, and whether the pattern of occurrence of alien species in European habitats interacts with macroecological factors such as insularity, latitude or area. Results The highest numbers of alien plant and insect species were found in human‐made, urban or cultivated habitats; if controlled for habitat area in the region, wetland and riparian habitats appeared to support relatively high numbers of alien plant species too. Invasions by vertebrates were more evenly distributed among habitats, with aquatic and riparian, woodland and cultivated land most invaded. Mires, bogs and fens, grassland, heathland and scrub were generally less invaded. Habitat and taxonomic group explained most variation in the proportions of alien species occurring in individual habitats related to the total number of alien species in a region, and the basic pattern determined by these factors was fine‐tuned by geographical variables, namely by the mainland–island contrast and latitude, and differed among taxonomic groups. Main conclusions There are two ecologically distinct groups of alien species (plants and insects versus vertebrates) with strikingly different habitat affinities. Invasions by these two contrasting groups are complementary in terms of habitat use, which makes an overall assessment of habitat invasions in Europe possible. Since numbers of naturalized species in habitats are correlated among taxa within these two groups, the data collected for one group of vertebrates, for example, could be used to estimate the habitat‐specific numbers of alien species for other vertebrate groups with reasonable precision, and the same holds true for insects and plants.

We test multiple biogeographical hypotheses of species relationships, including the recently proposed Palawan Ark Hypothesis. Location Southeast Asia and the Philippines. Methods Samples of all island endemic and widespread Philippine Gekko species were collected and sequenced for one mitochondrial gene (NADH dehydrogenase subunit 2) and one nuclear gene (phosducin). We used maximum likelihood and Bayesian phylogenetic methods to derive the phylogeny. Divergence time analyses were used to estimate the time tree of Philippine Gekko in order to test biogeographical predictions of species relationships. The phylogenetic trees from the posterior distribution of the Bayesian analyses were used for testing biogeographical hypotheses. Haplotype networks were created for the widespread species Gekko mindorensis to explore genetic variation within recently divergent clades. Results Both maximum likelihood and Bayesian phylogenetic analyses indicated that Philippine Gekko species are a diverse clade with a long history in the archipelago. Ancestral range reconstruction and divergence time analyses suggest a Palawan microcontinental origin for this clade, coinciding with Palawan’s separation from Asia beginning 30 Ma, with subsequent diversification in the oceanic Philippine islands. The widespread species G. mindorensis and G. monarchus diversified in the late Miocene/early Pliocene and are potentially complexes of numerous undescribed species. Main conclusions The view of the Philippine islands as a ‘fringing archipelago’ does not explain the pattern of species diversity in the genus Gekko . Philippine Gekko species have diversified within the archipelago over millions of years of isolation, forming a large diverse group of endemic species. Furthermore, the Philippine radiation of gekkonid lizards demonstrates biogeographical patterns most consistent with stochastic colonization followed by in situ diversification. Our results reveal the need to consider deeper time geological processes and their potential role in the evolution of some Philippine terrestrial organisms.

If sexual reproduction is favored by unpredictably changed conditions, then it would appear that regions of greater biotic stress are more unpredictable than those where abiotic factors are a major source of stress. We suspect that this greater unpredictability stems from interspecific interactions (competition, predation). We further suggest that the changing genotypes of the organisms with which an individual interacts are the major source of this biotic uncertainty; that, once evolved, sex in one population may lead to the contagious spread and persistence of sex in a community of highly interacting individuals.","0003-0147

The oniscid fauna consists of sixty-nine species, thirty-two genera and fourteen families and is characterized by Aegean elements that have an eastern Mediterranean origin. Endemism is at the level of 20%, similar to that of oniscids from other Mediterranean archipelagoes. Analysis of species distribution through both idiographic and quantitative approaches (faunal similarity among islands using Jaccard's index, simple matching indices and the UPGMA clustering technique) resulted in the recognition of a major disjunction between Kykladesplus-Ikaria and eastern islands-plus-Astypalea and four noteworthy island groups: the eastern islands, Naxos-Ikaria, Amorgos, and all other Kyklades. Island similarities are generally consistent with the known palaeogeography of the area with the exception of Ikaria's placement with Naxos among the Kyklades.

",,,,"Aim To investigate the formation of nestedness and species co-occurrence patterns at the local (sampling station), the intermediate (island group), and the archipelago scale.

Location The study used data on the distribution of terrestrial isopods on 20 islands of the central Aegean (Greece). These islands are assigned to two distinct subgroups (Kyklades and Eastern islands).

Methods The Nestedness Temperature Calculator was used to obtain nestedness values and maximally nested matrices, the EcoSim7 software and a modified version of Sanderson (2000) method were used for the analysis of species co-occurrences. Idiosyncratic temperatures of species and the order of species placement in the maximally nested matrices were used for further comparisons among spatial scales. The relationships of nestedness values with beta-diversity, habitat diversity and a number of ecological factors recorded for each sampling station were also investigated.

Results Significant nestedness was found at all spatial scales. Levels of nestedness were not related to beta-diversity or habitat diversity. Nestedness values were similar among spatial scales, but they were affected by matrix size. The species that contributed most to the nested patterns within single islands were not the same as those that produce nestedness at the archipelago scale. There was significant variation in the frequency of species occurrence among islands and among spatial scales. There was no direct effect of ecological factors on the shaping of patterns of nestedness within individual islands, but habitat heterogeneity was crucial for the existence of such patterns. Positive associations among species prevailed at all scales when species per station were considered, while negative associations prevailed in the species per island matrices. All associations resulted from the habitat structure of sampling stations and from particularities of geographical distributions.

Conclusions There was no clear-cut distinction between nestedness patterns among spatial scales, even though different species, and partially different factors, contributed to the formation of these patterns in each case. There was a core of species that contributed to the formation of nested patterns at all spatial scales, while the patterns of species associations suggested that biotic interactions are not an important causal factor. The results of this study suggest that locally rare species cannot be widespread at a higher spatial scale, while locally common species can have a restricted distribution.","1466-822X

",,,,"Abstract  Plants that rely on other plants for support (i.e. epiphytes and vines) are common in many forest ecosystems. However, they are poorly understood relative to terrestrial plants, especially in the Southern Hemisphere. To help bridge this gap, we evaluated the diversity and distribution of vascular epiphytes and vines on seven common tree species in a conifer-broadleaf forest on New Zealand's North Island. Ground-based surveys of 274 host trees were used to test whether epiphyte and vine diversity increased with tree diameter, and whether diversity-diameter relationships differed among host tree species. Occurrence patterns of individual epiphyte and vine species were also assessed. We first evaluated the accuracy of ground-based inventories by comparing surveys of trees made from the ground to those made from a canopy walkway. On average, 1 in 10 species of epiphytes and vines were unseen from the ground. However, sampling accuracy did not differ among the three host tree species growing along the walkway, suggesting unbiased comparisons could be made between hosts. Results from ground-based surveys showed that species diversity of epiphytes and vines increased with host tree diameter. However, epiphytes showed stronger diversity-diameter relationships than vines. Epiphyte diversity increased markedly in four host species and less strongly in the remaining three host species. Conversely, vines showed weak diversity-diameter relationships in all host species. Occurrence patterns of individual species helped to explain diversity-diameter relationships. All common epiphyte species occurred more frequently on large trees, regardless of host species, but occurrence patterns in most vine species were unrelated to tree size. Rather, the vines often showed strong host ‘preferences’. Overall results illustrate a rich diversity of distributional patterns in New Zealand's epiphytes and vines, and suggest that a similarly diverse set of ecological and evolutionary processes are responsible for them.","1442-9985

",,,,"Located between New Guinea and Australia, Torres Strait and its islands provide an opportunity to examine the results of recent isolation on the Australo-Papuan fauna. However, records of the modern diversity of terrestrial vertebrates on the islands remained scattered and poorly documented. Analyses of terrestrial vertebrate inventories and physical island variables can provide insight into pre-existing conditions of the Sahul land bridge and useful strategies for conservation efforts. We collated all available records of terrestrial vertebrates from the 17 inhabited islands and supplemented these with our own systematic surveys. We used Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient and nested analysis to determine how species richness relates to physical island variables. We also used cluster analysis to group similar islands based on their vertebrate assemblages. Vertebrate richness is not correlated with Simpson’s habitat diversity but is correlated with total number of habitat types, indicating that rare habitats may contribute disproportionately to richness. The archipelago supports a depauperate Australo-Papuan fauna and the assemblages found on smaller islands are subsets of those on larger islands. Island size is the most effective predictor of species richness, and the analysis reveals that geographically related islands support similar suites of species. The frequency with which our surveys added new records to individual island inventories highlights the need for additional sampling in the region.

",,,,"Abstract
The known terrestrial vertebrate fauna of the New Hebrides consists of 10 species of mammals (excluding feral domestic stock), 61 species of resident land- and freshwater birds, 20 species of reptiles and one amphibian. Of these, three, five, four and one species respectively have apparently been introduced by man. The non-introduced fauna is clearly Indo-Australian in origin, but some species have an exclusively Pacific island distribution and others (two bats, seven birds, and four lizards) are endemic. On the six islands visited 95 out of the possible 98 vertebrate species occur. Santo, the largest and most northerly island, supports the richest fauna. The comparative impoverishment of more southerly islands is not directly attributable to the progressive increase in isolation and distance from presumptive source area, nor to decrease in island area or maximum height. Most of the native vertebrates, including all endemic species, occur in mature serai or climax forest; relatively few species, all of which are cosmopolitan or wideranging in the Indo-Pacific region, are restricted to open habitats. Of introduced vertebrates only the feral pig, Rattus exulans and Gallus gallus occur in forest; the remainder are commensal with man or confined to disturbed or open habitats. Forest faunas show altitudinal zonation and vertical stratification under the canopy. The ranges of three large skinks are mutually exclusive, and may be complementary. No bats or birds have comparable complementary distributions, but among four closely related pairs of birds the niche of species widespread in the archipelago is reduced in the presence of a less widely distributed relative. The diversity of the netted avifauna was constant despite marked variation in the diversity of canopy trees in the netting plots. Vegetational characteristics also failed to correlate with the presence or absence of bird species irregularly distributed throughout the archipelago. There have been suggestions that some forest-adapted species (pigeons, lorikeets) may move from island to island but direct observations are lacking. Among Halcyon chloris and many passerines interrupted distributions, differences in habitat preference and/or taxonomically significant differences in size or colour indicate limited exchange between adjacent islands, implying that populations are sedentary. The distribution of certain bird species indicates that active colonization of the New Hebrides is not yet complete. Artamus leucorhynchus has apparently invaded Aneityum in recent years. The present distribution of Lichmera incana is also interpreted in terms of current invasion, and suggests that a preliminary period of selection is necessary before an invader can advance from the coastal strip into the forested interior.

",,,,"MODERN biogeographic theory states that the number of species in a class or other large taxonomic unit that inhabits an island is maintained within narrow bounds by a dynamic steady state between colonization and extinction' (MacArthur and Wilson 1967). Although a recent experimental test of the theory upheld most of its expectations (Simberloff and Wilson 1969), there remains a paucity of data on natural colonization and extinction rates from which to judge the time scale of faunal turnover on islands of varying geographic status. Two previous studies of avifaunal turnover on islands have come to our attention, one involving the California Channel Islands (Diamond 1969) and the other, Karkar, a volcanic island off the north coast of New Guinea (Diamond 1971c). Here we report on changes in the birdlife of Mona Island that have transpired since the turn of the century. Mona is especially well suited for the measurement of turnover for a number of reasons: its terrestrial avifauna consists of a very limited number of species, most of which are common; its topography and vegetation are extremely uniform, making unlikely the possibility that species have escaped detection in small pockets of habitat; it is large enough (24 square miles) to provide living space for numerically ample populations, yet small enough to cover on foot from end to end; it has suffered comparatively little disturbance by man; and its avifauna has been thoroughly surveyed on several prior occasions, first in 1901. In having a fauna that is entirely composed of species found on the nearby western end of Puerto Rico, Mona also lends itself to a study of ecological release, an expansion in density, distribution, or behavior that is commonly observed when the performance of a species is recorded under high and low intensities of competition (Crowell 1961, 1962; Willis 1966; Diamond 1969, 1971a, 1971b; MacArthur et al. 1972). The presence of a gradient of habitat in Puerto Rico that extends from areas of high to low rainfall makes it possible to select a plot having almost any desired combination of structural characteristics. By comparing the censuses of matched plots, one obtains good control over at least some of the variables that potentially regulate faunal composition and density.

","Iturralde-Vinent, Manuel; MacPhee, R.",,Laurasia,,,1999.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Abstract
""This paper presents a series of detailed paleogeographical analyses of the Caribbean region, beginning with the opening of the Caribbean basin in the Middle Jurassic and running to the end of the Middle Miocene. Three intervals within the Cenozoic are given special treatment: Eocene-Oligocene transition (35-33 Ma), Late Oligocene (27-25 Ma), and early Middle Miocene (16-14 Ma). While land mammals and other terrestrial vertebrates may have occupied landmasses in the Caribbean basin at any time, according to the interpretation presented here the existing Greater Antillean islands, as islands, are no older than Middle Eocene. Earlier islands must have existed, but it is not likely that they remained as such (i.e., as subaerial entities) due to repeated transgressions, subsidence, and (not incidentally) the K/T bolide impact and associated mega-tsunamis. Accordingly, we infer that the on-island lineages forming the existing (i.e., Quaternary) Antillean fauna must all be younger than Middle Eocene. The fossil record, although still very poor, is consistent with the observation that most land mammals lineages entered the Greater Antilles around the Eocene-Oligocene transition. Western Laurasia (North America) and western Gondwana (South America) were physically connected as continental areas until the mid-Jurassic, ca. 170 Ma. Terrestrial connections between these continental areas since then can only have occurred via landbridges. In the Cretaceous, three major uplift events, recorded as regional unconformities, may have produced intercontinental landbridges involving the Cretaceous Antillean island arc. The Late Campanian/Early Maastrichtian uplift event is the one most likely to have resulted in a landbridge, as it would have been coeval with uplift of the dying Cretaceous arc. However, evidence is too limited for any certainty on this point. The existing landbridge (Panamanian Isthmus) was completed in the Pliocene; evidence for a precursor bridge late in the Middle Miocene is ambiguous. We marshal extensive geological evidence to show that, during the Eocene-Oligocene transition, the developing northern Greater Antilles and northwestern South America were briefly connected by a ""landspan"" (i.e., a subaerial connection between a continent and one or more offshelf islands) centered on the emergent Aves Ridge. This structure (Greater Antilles + Aves Ridge) is dubbed GAARlandia. The massive uplift event that apparently permitted these connections was spent by 32 Ma; a general subsidence followed, ending the GAARlandia landspan phase. Thereafter, Caribbean neotectonism resulted in the subdivision of existing land areas. The GAARlandia hypothesis has great significance for understanding the history of the Antillean biota. Typically, the historical biogeography of the Greater Antilles is discussed in terms of whether the fauna was largely shaped by strict dispersal or strict continent-island vicariance. The GAARlandia hypothesis involves elements of both. Continent-island vicariance sensu Rosen appears to be excludable for any time period since the mid-Jurassic. Even if vicariance occurred at that time, its relevance for understanding the origin of the modern Antillean biota is minimal. Hedges and co-workers have strongly espoused over-water dispersal as the major and perhaps only method of vertebrate faunal formation in the Caribbean region. However, surface-current dispersal of propagules is inadequate as an explanation of observed distribution patterns of terrestrial faunas in the Greater Antilles. Even though there is a general tendency for Caribbean surface currents to flow northward with respect to the South American coastline, experimental evidence indicates that the final depositional sites of passively floating objects is highly unpredictable. Crucially, prior to the Pliocene, regional paleoceanography was such that current-flow patterns from major rivers would have delivered South American waifs to the Central American coast, not to the Greater or Lesser Antilles. Since at least three (capromyid rodents, pitheciine primates, and megalonychid sloths) and possibly four (nesophontid insectivores) lineages of Antillean mammals were already on one or more of the Greater Antilles by the Early Miocene, Hedges' inference as to the primacy of over-water dispersal appears to be at odds with the facts.

",,,,"The major islands of the Western Mediterranean--Corsica, Sardinia, and the Balearic Islands--are continental terrenes that drifted towards their present day location following a retreat from their original position on the eastern Iberian Peninsula about 30 million years ago. Several studies have taken advantage of this well-dated geological scenario to calibrate molecular rates in species for which distributions seemed to match this tectonic event. Nevertheless, the use of external calibration points has revealed that most of the present-day fauna on these islands post-dated the opening of the western Mediterranean basin. In this study, we use sequence information of the cox1, nad1, 16S, L1, and 12S mitochondrial genes and the 18S, 28S, and h3 nuclear genes, along with relaxed clock models and a combination of biogeographic and fossil external calibration points, to test alternative historical scenarios of the evolutionary history of the ground-dweller spider genus Parachtes (Dysderidae), which is endemic to the region. We analyse 49 specimens representing populations of most Parachtes species and close relatives. Our results reveal that both the sequence of species formation in Parachtes and the estimated divergence times match the geochronological sequence of separation of the main islands, suggesting that the diversification of the group was driven by Tertiary plate tectonics. In addition, the confirmation that Parachtes diversification matches well-dated geological events provides a model framework to infer substitution rates of molecular markers. Divergence rates estimates ranged from 3.5% My-1 (nad1) to 0.12% My-1 (28S), and the average divergence rate for the mitochondrial genes was 2.25% My-1, very close to the ""standard"" arthropod mitochondrial rate (2.3% My-1). Our study provides the first unequivocal evidence of terrestrial endemic fauna of the major western Mediterranean islands, whose origin can be traced back to the Oligocene separation of these islands from the continent. Moreover, our study provides useful information on the divergence rate estimates of the most commonly used genes for phylogenetic inference in non-model arthropods.

",,,,"The aim of this work is to provide a parsimony analysis of the Galapagos terrestrial vertebrates to understand their origin and relationships within the archipelago and to the American continents.

Location
The Galapagos archipelago is located 1000 km off the western coast of Ecuador. It is formed by 13 large islands (greater than 10 km2), six smaller islands and over 40 islets that have official names. Other small rocks and islets remain unnamed. The archipelago straddles the equator at the 90th meridian west.

Methods
Lists of the living reptilian, land bird species and genera and Scalesia land plant species were compiled from various published and online works. Parsimony Analysis of Endemicity (PAE) was used to find the most parsimonious cladograms depicting the biogeographic relationships of Galapagos to the American continents and the intra-archipelago ones. Analyses of species richness vs. island extents, species sharing vs. distance between islands, and species sharing vs. island extents were performed to assess the distribution patterns of the analysed vertebrates.

Results
Genus distribution-based PAE results suggest that Galapagos archipelago was settled by South American reptiles. The Galapagos islands cluster with Ecuador, Chile and Peru. A large American clade including Meso-America, USA, Mexico and Colombia is supported by this work too. Sister group relationships between the Galapagos–western South American clade and the large American clade are not defined. Species distribution-based PAE results are not able to place the Galapagos into any clade. PAE intra-archipelago output shows that large islands cluster together, very small islands are placed with lesser confidence because of ecological noise explained by the analyses of species richness vs. extent, shared species vs. distance between islands, and shared species vs. extent relationships. This distribution-based work supports previously published phylogeny-based biogeographic analyses and corroborates them with an independent evidence. Two competing colonization models of the archipelago are discussed.","0305-0270

",,,,"Water erosion is a major threat to biodiversity, according to the European Commission’s Soil Thematic Strategy, as it negatively affects soil structure, soil fertility and water availability for plants. The island of Crete (Southern Greece) has been characterized as a biodiversity hotspot including several Natura 2000 (N2K)-protected areas. The aim of this study was to model the soil loss rate in Crete regarding species richness, habitat types and their conservation status, as well as the MAES (Mapping and Assessment of Ecosystem and their Services) ecosystem types. To this end, the RUSLE soil erosion prediction model was implemented, using freely available geospatial data and cloud-computing processes. The estimated average soil loss in the study area was 6.15 t ha−1 y−1, while there was no significant difference between the terrestrial N2K (6.06 t ha−1 y−1) and non-N2K (6.19 t ha−1 y−1) areas. Notably, the natural habitats of principal importance for the conservation of biodiversity (referred to as “priority” areas), according to Annex I to Directive 92/43/EEC, are threatened by soil erosion with an estimated mean annual soil loss equal to 8.58 t ha−1 y−1. It is also notable that grasslands, heathland and shrubs and sparsely vegetated areas experienced the highest erosion rates among the identified MAES ecosystem types. The results showed that soil erosion is a serious threat to biodiversity in N2K-protected areas. Therefore, there is a need for systematic spatiotemporal monitoring and the implementation of erosion mitigation measures.

",,,,"Aim To test whether congeneric species are significantly associated with one another in space, either positively or negatively. Also, to provide a framework for a causal investigation of co-occurrence patterns by a parallel comparison of interactions in geographical and ecological data matrices.

Location For the analysis of congeneric species’ co-occurrences we used 30 matrices covering a wide range of taxa and geographical areas, while for the causal investigation we used the distribution of 50 terrestrial isopod species on 20 islands and 264 sampling stations in the central Aegean archipelago, as well as a number of ecological variables for each sampling station.

Methods We developed a software program (cooc) that incorporates the species-by-species approach to co-occurrence analysis using EcoSim's output of prior null model analysis of co-occurrence. We describe this program in detail, and use it to investigate one of the most common assembly rules, namely, the decreased levels of co-occurrence among congeneric species pairs. For the causal analysis, we proceed likewise, cross-checking the results from the geographical and the ecological matrices. There is only one possible combination of results that can support claims for direct competition among species.

Results We do not get any strong evidence for widespread competition among congeneric species, while most communities investigated do not show significant patterns of species associations. The causal analysis suggests that the principal factors behind terrestrial isopod species associations are of historical nature. Some exceptional cases are also discussed.

Main conclusions Presence/absence data for a variety of taxa do not support the assembly rule that congeneric species are under more intense competition compared to less related species. Also, these same data do not suggest strong interactions among species pairs, regardless of taxonomic status. When significant species associations can be seen in such matrices, they mainly reflect the effects of history or of habitat requirements.","1466-822X

Hardback: price US$ 75, ISBN 1-55963-902-4 . Paperback: price US$40, ISBN 1-55963-903-2 . Phase One of the Global Invasive Species Programme (GISP I), which ran over the turn of the century, was not unlike the SCOPE Ecology of Biological Invasions programme in the 1980s. Both were chaired by Hal Mooney of Stanford, both went forward by a series of symposia, some published expeditiously, some less so. The SCOPE programme was almost entirely straight biology while GISP I had much more on human effects, economics, trade and management. This volume is the result of a GISP I symposium held in 1999 and, as the second part of the title indicates, has much on trade and management but also something on diplomacy and on risk assessment. It comes in two parts, each roughly half the book. The first part ‘Invasion causes, routes, and vectors: spatial and temporal patterns in terrestrial, freshwater, and marine ecosystems’ has nine chapters on plants, fungi, insects, terrestrial vertebrates, land and freshwater snails and slugs, aquatic vertebrates in the US, invasions of the coasts of the US, marine plants, and an analysis of shipping to the Great Lakes. To those I would add chapter 12, 60 pages on ‘Vectors and pathways of biological invasions in South Africa — past, present and future’ though that does have a final short section on legislation. As can be seen, these first chapters cover a wide range of organisms and situations but are nevertheless not comprehensive. They tend to be very factual so will be most useful for reference but they are not light reading. Richard Mack's first chapter on plant invasions worldwide is sensibly selective and, I found, considerably more readable than most of the other chapters in the first section. In the other chapters, I often found it difficult to see the wood for the trees and the messages that I did get were a bit platitudinous: for instance that large organisms are usually introduced intentionally, small ones by accident or that pelagic stages are found in ballast, sessile ones on the hull of ships. But I fear I'm being unfair, the detail is what matters. Nevertheless, more analysis in many of the chapters would have been welcome. The second part is more varied and gave me more to think about. There are chapters on invasive species management in both Australia and New Zealand with, appropriately for this symposium, emphasis on preventing invasions. The chapter on mitigating plant pests invading the US also emphasizes prevention. The 20-page chapter by Jamie Reaser and colleagues on ‘Environmental diplomacy and the global movement of invasive alien species: an US perspective’ is excellent on the present situation but doesn't go into what could be done or the suggestions that have been made. The rest of the second part is three chapters on risk assessment. Keith Hayes would like us to move to something more akin to the chemical industries hazard analysis and hazard operability. From my experience of these for genetically modified organisms, I would expect the information on invasions to be insufficient to make them work. Indeed he praises Charles Suckling's GENHAZ which, as far as I know, has been a total disappointment. Hayes reviews, very usefully, past attempts and then summarizes five bullet points that ‘a good bioinvasive risk assessment will have’ but goes on to note ‘few bioinvasive risk assessments exhibit all (or indeed any) of these characteristics’. Richard Orr gives more detail, including the forms, for a particular risk analysis review process, one of several discussed by Hayes. David Andow gives a thoughtful, if brief, discussion, in the context of pathways, of the differences between ex post and ex ante analyses and what needs to be done. Andow's chapter leads neatly into the third part, a single 46-page chapter by the editors, an attempt at ‘A conceptual framework for management’. Apparently this is a shortened version of a chapter in the much delayed overview volume of GISP I. It has much sensible comment with interesting ideas and I was glad to see my aphorism ‘explanation is not prediction’ which encapsulates a fundamental difficulty with invasion risk analysis. Even so, this chapter is largely aspirational, complete with ‘an ecologist's graph’ (a diagram with speculative lines and no numbers on either axis). But management has to be done now and this chapter is a useful guide about how management of pathways can be improved while we learn more about the science. Altogether, this is a most useful book, but it shows too how much we still have to do.

Finally, we show that the observed distribution of the covariance range has significantly longer tails than random, with clear geographic correspondences.

",,,,"Aim Nearly 150 years ago, T. H. Huxley modified Wallace’s Line, including the island of Palawan as a component of the Asian biogeographic realm and separating it from the oceanic Philippines. Although Huxley recognized some characteristics of a transition between the regions, Palawan has since been regarded primarily as a peripheral component of the Sunda Shelf. However, several recent phylogenetic studies of Southeast Asian lineages document populations on Palawan to be closely related to taxa from the oceanic Philippines, apparently contradicting the biogeographic association of Palawan with the Sunda Shelf. In the light of recent evidence, we evaluate taxonomic and phylogenetic data in an attempt to identify the origin(s) of Palawan’s terrestrial vertebrate fauna.

Location The Sunda Shelf and the Philippines.

Methods We review distributional and phylogenetic data for populations of terrestrial vertebrates from Palawan. Using taxonomic data, we compare the number of Palawan taxa (species and genera) shared with the Sunda Shelf and oceanic Philippines. Among widespread lineages, we use phylogenetic data to identify the number of Palawan taxa with sister relationships to populations or species from the Sunda Shelf or oceanic Philippines.

Results Although many terrestrial vertebrate taxa are shared between Palawan and the Sunda Shelf, an increasing number of species and populations are now recognized as close relatives of lineages from the oceanic Philippines. Among the 39 putative lineages included in molecular phylogenetic studies with sampling from the Sunda Shelf, Palawan and the oceanic Philippines, 17 of them reveal sister relationships between lineages from Palawan and the oceanic Philippines.

Main conclusions Rather than a simple nested subset of Sunda Shelf populations, Palawan is best viewed as having played multiple biogeographic roles, including a young and old extension of the Sunda Shelf, a springboard to diversification in the oceanic Philippines, and a biogeographic component of the Philippine archipelago. Palawan has a long, complex geological history, which may explain this variation in pattern. Huxley originally noted transitional elements in Palawan’s fauna; we therefore suggest that his modification of Wallace’s Line should be recognized as a filter zone, reflecting both his original intent and available taxonomic and molecular evidence.","0305-0270

",,,,"Distribution patterns of indigenous non-volant terrestrial mammals on 257 Australian islands were examined in relation to environmental parameters and the effects of human-induced disturbance during prehistoric and historic times on island species numbers. Species occurrence for individual species, for taxonomic and trophic groups, and for all species together was related to environmental parameters using regression analysis and the extreme-value function model. Patterns of occurrence were examined separately within three major biogeographic regions derived by pattern analysis. The number of species known to have occurred on these islands during historic times was adequately predicted from area alone. No statistically significant improvement in predicted species number was gained by including island elevation, mean annual rainfall, isolation from the mainland or the number of potentially competing species present on the island. Similarly, no single factor other than area was found to influence consistently the presence of individual species. We conclude that the occurrence of indigenous non-volant terrestrial mammal species on these islands indicates a relictual rather than equilibrial fauna. Visitation by Aboriginal people during prehistoric times did not significantly increase mammal extinctions on islands. Examination of patterns of species richness for a given area on a regional basis showed that islands in and around Bass Strait and Tasmania (Bass Region) were the most species-rich, islands off the northern coasts were slightly less rich, and islands off the south western coasts had fewest species. This is in contrast to the usual latitudinal gradient in species richness patterns. However, islands off the northern and eastern coasts had an overall greater number of different species. When considered in relation to the number of different species of mammals occurring within each region, islands of a given size in Bass Region typically bore a higher proportion of this species pool than other regions. The Bass Region was found to be particularly rich in macropoid herbivores and dasyurid carnivores and insectivores. Analyses indicated that there is a very strong relationship between the presence of exotics as a whole and the local extinction of native mammals. Many mammal species formerly widespread on the Australian mainland are now restricted totally to islands (nine species) or are threatened with extinction on the mainland and have island populations of conservation significance (ten species). In all, thirty-five islands protect eighteen taxa of Australian threatened mammals. The land-use and management of these islands is of considerable importance to nature conservation. The introduction of exotic mammals to these islands should be prevented; any introductions that occur should be eradicated immediately.","0305-0270

2. Diversity indices did not group samples by site whereas the divisive polythetic classification analysis TWINSPAN showed that the two sites possessed clearly different communities. In the classification, site was of primary importance, with time of year, and trap position within site of secondary and tertiary importance respectively.

3. Samples were compared at different taxonomic levels and using different subsets of the database. Determination of the main families, morphotyped to species or species complex, was found to be sufficient to classify most samples to the appropriate community group.

We use this data set to analyse: (1) the global distribution; (2) the temporal dynamics; (3) the flows between native and alien ranges; and (4) the key drivers of established alien amphibians and reptiles. Location Worldwide. Methods We collected geographical records of established amphibians and reptiles from a thorough search across a wide number of sources. We supplemented these data with year of first record, when available. We used descriptive statistics and data visualization techniques to analyse taxonomic, spatial and temporal patterns in establishment records and the global flows of alien species. We used generalized linear mixed models to relate spatial variation in the number of established species richness with variables describing geographical, environmental and human factors. Results Our database covers 86% of the terrestrial area of the world. We identified 78 alien amphibian and 198 alien reptile species established in at least one of our 359 study regions. These figures represent about 1.0% of the extant global amphibian and 1.9% of the extant global reptile species richness. The flows of amphibians were dominated by exchanges between and within North and South America, and within Europe (59% of all links). For reptiles, the network of global flows of established alien species was much more diverse, with every continental region being both a donor and a recipient of similar importance. The number of established alien amphibians and reptiles has grown slowly until 1950 and strongly increased thereafter. Our generalized linear mixed models revealed that insularity, climatic conditions, and socio‐economic development significantly influenced the distributional patterns for both groups. Main conclusions We conclude that biological invasions by alien amphibians and reptiles are a rapidly accelerating phenomenon, particularly on islands with heterogeneous climates of economically highly developed countries.

",,,,"In cold environments such as polar regions, microorganisms play important ecological roles, and most of our knowledge about them comes from studies of cultivable microorganisms. Metagenomic technologies are powerful tools that can give a more comprehensive assessment of microbial communities, and the amplification of rDNA followed by next-generation sequencing has given good results in studies aimed particularly at environmental microorganisms. Culture-independent studies of microbiota in terrestrial habitats of Antarctica, which is considered the driest, coldest climate on Earth, are increasing and indicate that micro-diversity is much higher than previously thought. In this work, the microbial diversity of terrestrial habitats including eight islands of the South Shetland Archipelago, two islands on the Antarctic Peninsula and Union Glacier, was studied by amplicon-metagenome analysis. Molecular analysis of the studied localities clustered together the islands of the South Shetland Archipelago, except Greenwich Island, and separated them from the Litchfield and Lagotellerie islands and Union Glacier, which is in agreement with the latitudinal difference among them. Among fungi, 87 genera and 123 species were found, of which species belonging to 37 fungal genera not previously cultivated from Antarctica were detected. Phylogenetic analysis, including the closest BLAST-hit sequences, clustered fungi in 11 classes being the most represented Lecanoromycetes and Eurotiomycetes.

",,,,"Biological invasions are a defining feature of the Anthropocene, but the factors that determine the spatially uneven distribution of alien plant species are still poorly understood. Here, we present the first global analysis of the effects of biogeographic factors, the physical environment and socio-economy on the richness of naturalized and invasive alien plants. We used generalized linear mixed-effects models and variation partitioning to disentangle the relative importance of individual factors, and, more broadly, of biogeography, physical environment and socio-economy. As measures of the magnitude of permanent anthropogenic additions to the regional species pool and of species with negative environmental impacts, we calculated the relative richness of naturalized (= RRN) and invasive (= RRI) alien plant species numbers adjusted for the number of native species in 838 terrestrial regions. Socio-economic factors (per-capita gross domestic product (GDP), population density, proportion of agricultural land) were more important in explaining RRI (~50 % of the explained variation) than RRN (~40 %). Warm-temperate and (sub)tropical regions have higher RRN than tropical or cooler regions. We found that socio-economic pressures are more relevant for invasive than for naturalized species richness. The expectation that the southern hemisphere is more invaded than the northern hemisphere was confirmed only for RRN on islands, but not for mainland regions nor for RRI. On average, islands have ~6-fold RRN, and >3-fold RRI compared to mainland regions. Eighty-two islands (=26 % of all islands) harbour more naturalized alien than native plants. Our findings challenge the widely held expectation that socio-economic pressures are more relevant for plant naturalization than for invasive plants. To meet international biodiversity targets and halt the detrimental consequences of plant invasions, it is essential to disrupt the connection between socio-economic development and plant invasions by improving pathway management, early detection and rapid response.

",,"BioMed Central
",,,,"Abstract Background The amphipod crustacean Palmorchestia hypogaea occurs only in La Palma (Canary Islands) and is one of the few terrestrial amphipods in the world that have adapted to a strictly troglobitic life in volcanic cave habitats. A surface-dwelling closely related species ( Palmorchestia epigaea ) lives in the humid laurel forest on the same island. Previous studies have suggested that an ancestral littoral Orchestia species colonized the humid forests of La Palma and that subsequent drought episodes in the Canaries reduced the distribution of P. epigaea favouring the colonization of lava tubes through an adaptive shift. This was followed by dispersal via the hypogean crevicular system. Results P. hypogaea and P. epigaea did not form reciprocally monophyletic mitochondrial DNA clades. They showed geographically highly structured and genetically divergent populations with current gene flow limited to geographically close surface locations. Coalescence times using Bayesian estimations assuming a non-correlated relaxed clock with a normal prior distribution of the age of La Palma, together with the lack of association of habitat type with ancestral and recent haplotypes, suggest that their adaptation to cave life is relatively ancient. Conclusion The data gathered here provide evidence for multiple invasions of the volcanic cave systems that have acted as refuges. A re-evaluation of the taxonomic status of the extant species of Palmorchestia is needed, as the division of the two species by habitat and ecology is unnatural. The information obtained here, and that from previous studies on hypogean fauna, shows the importance of factors such as the uncoupling of morphological and genetic evolution, the role of climatic change and regressive evolution as key processes in leading to subterranean biodiversity.

Location Terrestrial and wetland habitats world-wide.

Methods Relevant data were assembled on the morphology, ecology and global geographical distribution of N. vas from a comprehensive literature review of published original records. The data were collated, analysed and summarized. The roles of long-term and short-term agents of dispersal are discussed.

Results A clear and repeated pattern has been elucidated of a microbial species, with a distinctive and unmistakeable morphology, that inhabits acid, damp terrestrial and wetland habitats in the southern cool-temperate and sub-Antarctic zones – including similar high-altitude habitats in the Tropics. It is almost entirely confined to the Gondwanaland continents and Southern Hemisphere islands. It is definitively absent from Holarctic regions. It is proposed that the continental distribution of N. vas is a consequence of continental drift following its original speciation in the Mesozoic or earlier, whereas its distribution on sub-Antarctic islands (glaciated in the Pleistocene) has been effected by dispersal from South America by wind around the Southern Ocean.

Main conclusion Nebela vas is a proven instance of a microbial species that does not have a cosmopolitan distribution.","0305-0270

",,,,"That larger areas will typically host more diverse ecological assemblages than small ones has been regarded as one of the few fundamental ‘laws’ in ecology. Yet, area may affect not only species diversity, but also the trophic structure of the local ecological assemblage. In this context, recent theory on trophic island biogeography offers two clear-cut predictions: that the slope of the species–area relationship should increase with trophic rank, and that food chain length (i.e. the number of trophic levels) should increase with area. These predictions have rarely been verified in terrestrial systems. To offer a stringent test of key theory, we focused on local food chains consisting of trophic specialists: plants, lepidopteran herbivores, and their primary and secondary parasitoids. For each of these four trophic levels, we surveyed species richness across a set of 20 off-shore continental islands spanning a hundred-fold range in size. We then tested three specific hypotheses: that species richness is affected by island size, that the slope of the species–area curve is related to trophic rank, and that such differences in slope translate into variation in food chain length with island size. Consistent with these predictions, estimates of the species–area slope steepened from plants through herbivores and primary parasitoids to secondary parasitoids. As a result of the elevated sensitivity of top consumers to island size, food chain length decreased from large to small islands. Since island size did not detectably affect the ratio between generalists and specialists among either herbivores (polyphages vs oligophages) or parasitoids (idiobionts vs koinobionts), the patterns observed seemed more reflective of changes in the overall number of nodes and levels in local food webs than of changes in their linking structure. Overall, our results support the trophic-level hypothesis of island biogeography. Per extension, they suggest that landscape modification may imperil food web integrity and vital biotic interactions.","0906-7590

We predict substantial differences between checklist and range map richness for smaller areas, where higher errors of commission from range maps are likely to occur. We also explore how discrepancies between species inventories and range maps may affect assessments of reserve prioritization and representation. Location Continental America and associated islands. Methods We obtained species numbers based on checklists for 619 protected areas from a variety of sources, including management plans, technical reports, environmental assessments, official websites, biodiversity databases and conservation agencies, and evaluated how these correlate with species richness estimates from geographical range map databases, also testing for an effect of reserve size on range map omission and commission errors. Results Species richness estimates obtained from checklists and range maps showed a significant positive relationship for all three groups of vertebrates, although for most protected areas, estimates of richness from range overlap maps tended to be overestimates, especially for amphibians and mammals in species‐rich regions. Protected area size explained little of the discrepancies between checklist and range map richness. Species representation in protected areas based on checklists was in general lower than representation based on range maps. Main conclusions Our results suggest that range maps, although far from perfect, have the advantage of reducing geographical biases and filling gaps that exist in point locality data at least in species‐rich protected areas, while most available checklists in these regions were extremely variable in quality and availability, lacking of basic information on survey design, reliability and completeness. However, range maps will likely overestimate species representation in protected areas and should thus be treated with caution in this context.

","Robbins, Robert; Opler, Paul",,,,,1997.0,,,69,82,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Butterflies are among the best-known insects•an estimated 90% of the world's species have scientific names. As a consequence, their biology has been extensively investigated (Vane-Wright and Ackery, 1984), and they are perhaps the best group of insects for examining patterns of terrestrial biotic diversity and distribution. Butterflies also have a favorable image with the general public. Hence, they are an excellent group for communicating information on science and conservation issues such as diversity. Perhaps the aspect of butterfly diversity that has received the most attention over the last century is the striking difference in species richness between tropical and temperate regions. For example, Bates (1875) wrote that it would convey some idea of the diversity of butterflies (in the neighborhood of Belem, a town near the mouth of the Amazon River) when he mentioned that about 700 species are found within a hour's walk of the town, whereas the total number found in the British Islands does not exceed 66, and the whole of Europe supports only 321. This early comparison of tropical and temperate butterfly richness has been well confirmed (e.g., Owen, 1971; Scriber, 1973). A general theory of diversity would have to predict not only this difference between temperate and tropical zones, but also patterns within each region, and how these patterns vary among different animal and plant groups. However, for butterflies, variation of species richness within temperate or tropical regions, rather than between them, is poorly understood. Indeed, comparisons of numbers ofspecies among the Amazon basin, tropical Asia, and Africa are still mostly ""personal communication"" citations, even for vertebrates (Gentry, 1988a). In other words, unlike comparisons between temperate and tropical areas, these patterns are still in the documentation phase. In documenting geographical variation in butterfly diversity, we make some arbitrary, but practical decisions. Diversity, number of species, and species richness are used synonymously; we know little about the evenness of butterfly relative abundances. The New World fauna makes up the preponderance of examples because we are most familiar with these species. By focusing on them, we hope to minimize the errors generated by imperfect and incomplete taxonomy. Although what is and is not a butterfly is technically controversial.
The first three sections of this chapter summarize general patterns of butterfly diversity throughout the world, within the conterminous United States, and in the Neotropics, respectively. The fourth section points out, albeit preliminarily, how the distributions of butterflies•and presumably other insects• paint a different biogeographical picture of the world than the distributions of birds and mammals.

Soil samples were collected along a climate gradient consisting of locations on the Antarctic Peninsula (Anchorage Island, 67 °34′S, 68 °08′W), Signy Island (60 °43′S, 45 °38′W) and the Falkland Islands (51 °76′S 59 °03′W).

Every 1 °C rise in soil temperature was estimated to increase Tmin by 0.24–0.38 °C. The optimum temperature for bacterial growth varied less and did not have as clear a relationship with soil temperature. Temperature sensitivity, indicated by Q10 values, increased with mean annual soil temperature, suggesting that bacterial communities from colder regions were less temperature sensitive than those from the warmer regions. The OTC warming (generally <1 °C temperature increases) over 3 years had no effects on temperature relationship of the soil bacterial community. We estimate that the predicted temperature increase of 2.6 °C for the Antarctic Peninsula would increase Tmin by 0.6–1 °C and Q10 (0–10 °C) by 0.5 units.","1354-1013

",,"Wiley
",,,,"1. Spatial subsidies, defined as the flow of energy, nutrients, organisms or pollutants from one habitat to another, have been shown to affect the food–web dynamics in a wide range of ecosystems. An important subsidy to riparian communities is the contribution of adult stream insects to terrestrial predators such as birds, bats and lizards, but also invertebrates including ground and web-building spiders.

2. We surveyed 37 first- and second-order forest streams across differing environmental gradients in the Central South Island, New Zealand, to investigate the relationship between potential aquatic prey subsidies and predatory riparian arachnids. We anticipated that stream-insect biomass would be positively associated with riparian arachnids, as a result of emergent adult aquatic insect subsidies to the adjacent habitat.

3. We confirmed positive associations between stream-insect biomass as a predictor variable and riparian arachnid biomass (R2 = 0.42, F1,34 = 25.2, P < 0.001) and web densities (R2 = 0.45, F1,14 = 11.5, P < 0.01) respectively as dependent variables after adjusting for the confounding effects of environmental variables. Hierarchical partitioning confirmed the importance of stream insect biomass as a statistically significant contributor to the total explained variance in analyses calculated for arachnid biomass, abundance and web density.

4. A concurrent survey of spider-web density along 20-m transects from the stream edge into the forest indicated a strong decline in web-building spider density moving away from the stream (R2 = 0.41, F1,158 = 109, P < 0.001), with stream-insect biomass as a significant covariate (F1,149 = 17.7, P < 0.001).

5. Our results suggest that productivity gradients present in the donor system affect the magnitude of the interaction between adjacent habitats. Productivity gradients may lead to increased reciprocal subsidies through a positive feedback loop involving the predation of spiders and other predatory terrestrial invertebrates by aquatic predators. However, terrestrial insectivores such as birds, bats and lizards that are not readily used as prey by aquatic predators may circumvent the feedback cycle by consuming a large proportion of emergent aquatic-insect biomass. This may lead to asymmetry in the strength of food–web linkages between aquatic and terrestrial habitats.","0046-5070

In the northern Pacific region, bears Ursus spp. foraging on anadromous salmon Oncorhynchus spp. provide a key link between marine and terrestrial ecosystems, with salmon density, fish size and watershed size as potential predictors of the magnitude of marine subsidy to terrestrial habitats. We use nitrogen and carbon stable isotopes to provide an assessment of the patterns of marine-enrichment in riparian plants (11 species, 4 guilds) and litter invertebrates (4 guilds) sampled from 27 watersheds in coastal British Columbia, Canada. Watersheds occurred in three geographical regions (Vancouver Island, mainland midcoast and Haida Gwaii) and varied in size, and in biomass (kg m−1 of spawning length) and species of salmon (chum O. keta, pink O. gorbuscha and coho O. kisutch). δ15N values in all plant species and invertebrate guilds were positively predicted by total salmon biomass (kg m−1) and negatively predicted by watershed size. We observed replicated parallel slopes among plant species and invertebrate guilds across the gradient in salmon biomass, with differences in means hypothesized to be due to plant fractionation and animal trophic position. As such, we derived a watershed δ15N-index averaged across guilds, and using an information theoretic approach we find that the biomass of chum salmon is a much stronger predictor of the δ15N-index than either pink or coho salmon, or the sum biomass of all species. The top linear model contained chum biomass and watershed size. Chum salmon biomass independently predicted δ15N-index variation in all three regions of British Columbia. Chum salmon are larger than pink or coho and provide an energetic reward for bears that facilitates carcass transfer, tissue selective foraging, and nutrient distribution by insect scavengers. Analyses of biodiversity and habitat data across many watersheds moves towards a long-term goal in fisheries ecology to better integrate ecosystem values in salmon conservation.","0030-1299

We developed a conceptual framework to identify globally important islands for invasive mammal eradications to prevent imminent extinctions of highly threatened species using biogeographic and technical factors, plus a novel approach to consider socio-political feasibility. We applied this framework using a comprehensive dataset describing the distribution of 1,184 highly threatened native vertebrate species (i.e. those listed as Critically Endangered or Endangered on the IUCN Red List) and 184 non-native mammals on 1,279 islands worldwide. Based on extinction risk, irreplaceability, severity of impact from invasive species, and technical feasibility of eradication, we identified and ranked 292 of the most important islands where eradicating invasive mammals would benefit highly threatened vertebrates. When socio-political feasibility was considered, we identified 169 of these islands where eradication planning or operation could be initiated by 2020 or 2030 and would improve the survival prospects of 9.4% of the Earth's most highly threatened terrestrial insular vertebrates (111 of 1,184 species). Of these, 107 islands were in 34 countries and territories and could have eradication projects initiated by 2020. Concentrating efforts to eradicate invasive mammals on these 107 islands would benefit 151 populations of 80 highly threatened vertebrates and make a major contribution towards achieving global conservation targets adopted by the world's nations.

The Role of Lichens in Antarctic Ecosystems'
D. C. LINDSAY2
Abstract. Antarctic terrestrial ecosystems can be divided into two main
series: those of continental Antarctica and those of the maritime Antarctic.
Within the former series, plant ""communities"" exist as isolated groupings of
plants growing under a severe continental polar-desert climate and appear to
be similar to communities of the High Arctic (e.g. the interior plateau of Devon
Island). Communities in the maritime Antarctic region are more diverse, with
less severe environmental conditions, and show affinities with lichen com-
munities occupying similar habitats in boreal-Arctic zones of the northern
hemisphere.
Roles played by lichens in the two series of ecosystems are influenced
considerably by environmental conditions and in continental Antarctica are
often completely subordinated to physical processes. Weathering of substrata,
for instance, in continental Antarctica, consists of the operation of several
physical processes with lichens playing an insignificant role.
It is only in the more suitable habitats found in the maritime Antarctic
that lichens are able to play their full role in the development and functioning
of ecosystems.","0007-2745

",,"CSIRO Publishing
",,,,"Invasive alien species are recognized as a major threat to island biodiversity and ecosystem functions worldwide, with well-documented, detrimental impacts on the native biota of Oceania. Despite their high number and rapid increase in the Pacific Islands, invasive alien plants (IAP) have received less attention by researchers, managers, and the general public compared to invasive animals (e.g., predatory mammals). Indeed, although lists of IAP in natural and agroecosystems have been set up in most island countries and territories, their ecological and socio-economical impacts are still not well documented and/or popularized. Very few IAP eradication successes have been reported, and postcontrol monitoring and cost-benefit analysis are often missing. Moreover, most of the published studies have been conducted in the Hawaiian and the Galápagos islands. This essay is a call for more research and management efforts on IAP in Oceania, especially in the small tropical Pacific Islands. Focal areas should not only include species bioecology, control strategies and methods and prioritization systems (including risk assessments), but also better understanding of island ecosystems functioning (e.g. forest dynamics and resilience), with the integration of past and present anthropogenic and natural disturbances. The importance of “novel” ecosystems, where natural habitats have been partially or totally modified by humans, and the potential effects of climate change on terrestrial ecosystems should be addressed, and new conservation and management strategies defined in the Pacific Islands, in order to try to halt biodiversity erosion in highly vulnerable island ecosystems.","1038-2097

",,,,"Land snails are one of the most diverse groups of terrestrial animals and are commonly used as model organisms in ecology, biogeography and conservation biology. Despite being poor dispersers, they form crucial components of island faunas and exhibit high percentages of endemism. Insular land snails are also among the most threatened animals on Earth, already having suffered extensive human-caused extinctions. However, current estimates of global insular land snail diversity are based on sporadic records published at the scale of individual islands and/or archipelagos. To tackle this shortfall, we herein present the major features of a global inventory of island snails. We recovered full species lists from existing literature and available species checklists for 727 islands across the globe and collated a database which currently includes the occurrence of 11,139 species, that is approximately 48% of all known land snail species (of which there are an estimated 23,000). Seventy-five percent of the species are single-island endemics, underlining the exceptional nature of islands as global biodiversity hotspots. Overall, our attempt is one of few to examine insular invertebrate diversity at coarser scales and a crucial step to the study of global patterns in island biodiversity.

",,,,"During the last few centuries oceanic island biodiversity has been drastically modified by human-mediated activities. These changes have led to the increased homogenization of island biota and to a high number of extinctions lending support to the recognition of oceanic islands as major threatspots worldwide. Here, we investigate the impact of habitat changes on the spider and ground beetle assemblages of the native forests of Madeira (Madeira archipelago) and Terceira (Azores archipelago) and evaluate its effects on the relative contribution of rare endemics and introduced species to island biodiversity patterns. We found that the native laurel forest of Madeira supported higher species richness of spiders and ground beetles compared with Terceira, including a much larger proportion of indigenous species, particularly endemics. In Terceira, introduced species are well-represented in both terrestrial arthropod taxa and seem to thrive in native forests as shown by the analysis of species abundance distributions (SAD) and occupancy frequency distributions (OFD). Low abundance range-restricted species in Terceira are mostly introduced species dispersing from neighbouring man-made habitats while in Madeira a large number of true rare endemic species can still be found in the native laurel forest. Further, our comparative analysis shows striking differences in species richness and composition that are due to the geographical and geological particularities of the two islands, but also seem to reflect the differences in the severity of human-mediated impacts between them. The high proportion of introduced species, the virtual absence of rare native species and the finding that the SADs and OFDs of introduced species match the pattern of native species in Terceira suggest the role of man as an important driver of species diversity in oceanic islands and add evidence for an extensive and severe human-induced species loss in the native forests of Terceira.

",,,,"Human land use is one of the primary threats to terrestrial species richness and is considered a priority for meeting global sustainability and biodiversity targets. Decision-support tools, such as life cycle assessment (LCA), are widely used for developing strategies to achieve such objectives. Currently available life cycle impact assessment (LCIA) methods apply the countryside species-area relationship (c-SAR) to quantify habitat conversion impacts on species richness. However, additional effects of habitat fragmentation are yet ignored in these assessments. We use the species-habitat relationship (SHR), an adaptation of the c-SAR that considers both habitat conversion and fragmentation effects, to develop a new set of land-use characterisation factors for 702 terrestrial ecoregions (in 238 countries), four land-use types (urban, cropland, pasture, and forestry), and four taxonomic groups (amphibians, birds, mammals, and reptiles; plus the aggregate of these vertebrate groups). The SHR generally predicts higher per-area impacts of land-use than the impacts estimated by the c-SAR (a median relative difference of +9%), indicating that land-use impacts may be systematically underestimated when ignoring fragmentation effects. Whereas per-area impacts of land-use on regional species richness are highest in temperate regions, reflecting the diminished extent of natural habitat, per-area impacts of land-use on global species richness are highest in the subtropics, reflecting the importance of tropical regions and islands to global vertebrate species diversity. The large variety in magnitude of land-use impacts across the world's regions emphasizes the importance of regionalised assessments. The set of characterisation factors proposed here can be readily used in environmental decision-making.

",,,,"Abstract The introduction of invasive species is one of the greatest threats to Earth’s biodiversity, as they can reduce native biodiversity and alter ecosystem structure and function. Currently, the only two known non-native terrestrial invertebrates in Antarctica are the chironomid midge Eretmoptera murphyi and the enchytraeid worm Christensenidrilus blocki . These invertebrates were probably introduced to ground near Signy Research Station, South Orkney Islands, during transplantation experiments in the late 1960s. Between 2007 and 2009, this study surveyed the area around the introduction site for midge larvae and worms to assess any change over the last four decades in their spatial distribution, habitat preference and colonization status. Eretmoptera murphyi was found in concentrations up to 4.1 × 10 5 larvae m -2 (mean 2.1 × 10 4 larvae m -2 ) at distances of up to 220 m from the probable introduction site ( c . 35 000 m 2 ), while C. blocki was only found close to the introduction site in low numbers. Significantly more E. murphyi larvae were found in peat and dead organic material (3.34 × 10 4 m -2 ) than in stony soil and gravel (1.52 × 10 4 m -2 ) or living moss and other plant material (1.16 × 10 4 m -2 ). Eretmoptera murphyi can no longer be considered a persistent alien as it clearly expanding its distribution, while C. blocki remains a persistent alien species.

",,,,"1. Introduction Tristan da Cunha, Inaccessible, Nightingale and Gough Islands are similar in climate, physiography and vegetation, and form a single biogeographical province. Many animal species, including some endemics, occur on all of them, and the faunas of the four islands have the same general characteristics and show a common relationship to stocks in temperate South America. Any discussion of the fauna of the group must therefore consider all four main islands. Such a general evaluation is rendered difficult by variations in the intensity of study of the different islands and of different taxonomic groups. It is probably true today that the native land fauna of the archipelago is adequately known in outline, and that no native vertebrate or abundant large terrestrial invertebrate species awaits discovery. However, the smallei and less conspicuous land invertebrates and the majority of the shallow-water marine organisms are undoubtedly underworked, and much remains to be discovered about the detailed distribution, ecology and interrelationships of the island faunas. The present paper is no more than an interim review of the extent and deficiency of current knowledge.

",,,,"There are concerns that Reduced Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation (REDD+) may fail to deliver potential biodiversity cobenefits if it is focused on high carbon areas. We explored the spatial overlaps between carbon stocks, biodiversity, projected deforestation threats, and the location of REDD+ projects in Indonesia, a tropical country at the forefront of REDD+ development. For biodiversity, we assembled data on the distribution of terrestrial vertebrates (ranges of amphibians, mammals, birds, reptiles) and plants (species distribution models for 8 families). We then investigated congruence between different measures of biodiversity richness and carbon stocks at the national and subnational scales. Finally, we mapped active REDD+ projects and investigated the carbon density and potential biodiversity richness and modeled deforestation pressures within these forests relative to protected areas and unprotected forests. There was little internal overlap among the different hotspots (richest 10% of cells) of species richness. There was also no consistent spatial congruence between carbon stocks and the biodiversity measures: a weak negative correlation at the national scale masked highly variable and nonlinear relationships island by island. Current REDD+ projects were preferentially located in areas with higher total species richness and threatened species richness but lower carbon densities than protected areas and unprotected forests. Although a quarter of the total area of these REDD+ projects is under relatively high deforestation pressure, the majority of the REDD+ area is not. In Indonesia at least, first-generation REDD+ projects are located where they are likely to deliver biodiversity benefits. However, if REDD+ is to deliver additional gains for climate and biodiversity, projects will need to focus on forests with the highest threat to deforestation, which will have cost implications for future REDD+ implementation. Los Patrones Espaciales del Carbono, la Biodiversidad, la Amenaza de Deforestación y los Proyectos REDD+ en Indonesia Actualmente hay preocupación por que las Emisiones Reducidas de la Deforestación y Degradación del Bosque (REDD+, en inglés) puedan fallar en la entrega de co–beneficios potenciales de la biodiversidad si se enfocan en áreas de alto carbono. Exploramos los traslapes espaciales entre los stocks de carbono, la biodiversidad, las amenazas proyectadas de deforestación y la ubicación de proyectos REDD+ en Indonesia, un país tropical a la vanguardia del desarrollo REDD+. Para la biodiversidad, reunimos datos sobre la distribución de vertebrados terrestres (hábitats de anfibios, mamíferos, aves y reptiles) y plantas (modelos de distribución de especies para ocho familia). Después investigamos la congruencia entre las diferentes medidas de la riqueza de la biodiversidad y los stocks de carbono en la escala nacional y sub–nacional. Finalmente mapeamos proyectos REDD+ activos e investigamos la densidad de carbono y la riqueza potencial de la biodiversidad y modelamos presiones de deforestación dentro de estos bosques en relación con áreas protegidas y no protegidas. Hubo poco traslape interno entre los diferentes hotspots (el 10% más rico de las celdas) de riqueza de especies. Tampoco hubo congruencia espacial consecuente entre los stocks de carbono y las medidas de la biodiversidad: una correlación negativa débil en la escala nacional enmascaró las relaciones altamente variables y no-lineales isla por isla. Los proyectos REDD+ actuales estuvieron ubicados preferencialmente en áreas con una riqueza total de especies y con una riqueza de especies amenazadas más altas pero con densidades de carbono más bajas que en las áreas protegidas y los bosques sin protección. Aunque un cuarto del área total de estos proyectos REDD+ está bajo una presión de deforestación relativamente alta, la mayoría del área REDD+ no lo está. Por lo menos en Indonesia, los proyectos REDD+ de primera generación están ubicados en donde tengan probabilidad de entregar beneficios para la biodiversidad. Sin embargo, si se espera que REDD+ entregue beneficios adicionales para el clima y la biodiversidad, los proyectos necesitarán enfocarse en los bosques con la mayor amenaza de deforestación, lo que tendrá implicaciones de costo para la implementación futura de REDD+. There has been a lot of interest in the potential of forest carbon sequestration projects such as those being discussed under the climate mechanism to Reduce Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation (REDD+) to deliver benefits for biodiversity. Under the proposed mechanism, REDD+ payments are intended to protect threatened tropical forests by providing economic incentives for continued forest integrity (Venter & Koh 2011). The plus in REDD+ expands the scope to include the conservation, sustainable management, and enhancement of forest carbon stocks as means to reduce emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (UNFCCC 2008). Some argue that REDD+ offers ""unprecedented"" opportunities for biodiversity (Gardner et al. 2012) and provides new funding for conservation (Venter et al. 2009), rehabilitation of critical habitat (Alexander et al. 2011), and the establishment of new protected areas (PAs) (Macdonald et al. 2011). However, many have also drawn attention to potential risks for biodiversity that are associated with preferential targeting of REDD+ projects in high carbon areas, such as displacement of land use pressure (leakage) into high biodiversity but low carbon areas (Harrison & Paoli 2012) and the diversion of funds for forest conservation away from high biodiversity low carbon areas (Phelps et al. 2012). The degree to which carbon and biodiversity services are colocated in the landscape will influence the potential for delivery of biodiversity benefit; more opportunities are expected where there is congruence between high carbon and biodiversity stocks (Strassburg et al. 2010). There are strong synergies between carbon and biodiversity at the global level (Strassburg et al. 2010). National scale analyses, particularly important for planning REDD+ as an intergovernmental mechanism (Gardner et al. 2012), have been variable in quality and provide ambiguous results. National-level analyses (Madagascar and Bolivia) with finer scale biodiversity data show little congruence between the two or between carbon and biodiversity (Wendland et al. 2010; Sangermano et al. 2012). However, the additional gains from REDD+ for carbon, biodiversity, and other ecosystem services depend on spatially specific threats of deforestation and forest degradation (Busch & Grantham 2013), few, if any, analyses have included both spatial congruence and deforestation threat. Indonesia is the third largest tropical forest country, a major contributor to global greenhouse gas emissions from deforestation, forest and peat degradation (Margono et al. 2014), and a mega-biodiversity country (Sodhi et al. 2004). Indonesia has made commitments to reduce emissions (GOI 2012) and received significant donor funding for REDD+ implementation (Brockhaus et al. 2012). We assessed the distribution of biodiversity in Indonesia, using species ranges of terrestrial vertebrates (mammals, birds, reptiles, and amphibians) and species distribution models (SDMs) covering 8 plant families which are available for Sundaland only. We explored the congruence between carbon and biodiversity based on 3 measures of richness. We then assessed the location of REDD+ projects relative to deforestation threats and spatially determined potential for these to deliver positive outcomes for carbon and biodiversity. Our biodiversity analyses were based on recently updated global species range data for the distribution of mammals, reptiles, and amphibians (IUCN 2012), birds (BirdLife International and NatureServe 2012), and SDMs for 8 major plant families (Dipterocarpaceae, Ericaceae, Fagaceae, Lauraceae, Moraceae, Myristicaceae, Sapindaceae, and Leguminosae) in Sundaland. Details on the biodiversity data sets we used are in Supporting Information. We used newly available high-resolution carbon data sets for above ground biomass (AGB) (Baccini et al. 2012) and soil organic carbon (SOC) up to 100 cm depth (Hiederer & Köchy 2012). A database of active REDD+ projects in Indonesia was developed for the purpose of this research. We contacted all known REDD+ project developers in Indonesia via email to identify active projects, their central coordinates, and the project size. We achieved a 72% response rate and filled in gaps with best guesses based on available gray literature and Web-based reports. We mapped the location of individual projects based on known project boundaries (n = 22), district boundaries for district level projects (n = 3), and circular boundaries for projects for which we did not have exact boundary information (n = 11). For the circular boundaries, we drew a circle around the project centroid on the diameter of which was based on information about project area provided by project developers. See Supporting Information for details on the REDD+ database. The PA data set for Indonesia was obtained from the newly updated World Database on PAs (IUCN & UNEP-WCMC 2013). We included PAs in categories I–VI and nationally recognized PAs without an IUCN category (280 in total). We used the econometric model OSIRIS-Indonesia developed by Busch et al. (2010) to predict deforestation in the absence of REDD+ carbon incentives. The model predicts deforestation based on estimated potential gross agricultural revenues and the cost of converting land from forest to agriculture. Data sets were analyzed at 5 km × 5 km resolution in the WGS 1984 World Mercator projection. We clipped global data sets to the Indonesian Archipelago (total terrestrial land areas), which covers 79,555 terrestrial cells. (Supporting Information for additional information on the spatial analysis methods.) Species distribution analyses were based on the polygon vector ranges of 367 amphibian, 281 reptile, 665 mammal, 1559 bird species, and SDMs of 1720 plant species. Following Wang et al. (2013), we calculated species richness as the number of species range polygons that intersect each grid cell. We used 3 measures of species richness: total species, threatened species, and restricted range species. Threatened species were those classified by the IUCN (2012) as critically endangered, endangered, and vulnerable. Restricted range species were species with a global range in the lowest quartile of their range class (Orme et al. 2005; Grenyer et al. 2006). Species richness of threatened and restricted range species was analyzed only for vertebrates. We identified the richest grid cells (hereafter hotspots [Orme et al. 2005]) for each richness measure for vertebrates and plants (total richness for Sundaland only). We explored the degree to which hotspots overlapped when defined as the richest 10% of cells and the effects of using different hotspot definitions (richest 5%, 10%, 15%, and 25%). We found that regardless of the definition used, there was no overlap between hotspots identified based on different measures of species richness. (Details in Supporting Information.) Indonesian islands differ in size, isolation, topography, climate, and geology, which results in very different island mean biodiversity and carbon values. We therefore investigated congruence at 3 levels—national and within the 5 major islands (Sumatra, Borneo, Papua, Sulawesi, and Java)—to investigate if national scale patterns are consistent within islands. We selected AGB and SOC up to 100 cm depth based on findings that when congruence was evaluated at 3 soil depths (0, 30, and 100 cm), SOC depth had a clear effect on the congruence patterns, particularly in areas identified as carbon-rich peat swamp forests (see Supporting Information). Congruence between carbon and the 3 measures of biodiversity richness were assessed using Spearman's rank correlation coefficient; the effective degrees of freedom were corrected by the level of spatial autocorrelation in the data following Dutilleul (1993). We used hexagonal binning (an esthetic mapping technique that shows differences between data-rich and data-sparse parts of the distribution) to visualize the relationship between carbon and biodiversity and fitted a generalized additive model with 95% CIs. All statistical analyses were carried out in R statistical software (R Core Team 2014). Congruence maps were developed in ArcGis 10.1 with the RGB composite band tool. We assessed the distance and overlap between REDD+ projects (centroid) and PAs (polygon) with the near function in ArcGIS 10.1. We explored the distribution of carbon and biodiversity in Indonesia for 3 categories of forested areas: REDD+ project areas, PAs, and other unprotected forest (outside REDD+ projects and PAs). We defined forest as those pixels comprising mangrove, peat swamp forest, lowland forest, lower montane forest, upper montane forest, and plantation or regrowth as in Miettinen et al. (2012). We sampled 1000 random points from all 3 forest categories and compared the means of the 3 groups with analysis of variance followed by a post hoc Tukey's honestly significant difference test to determine categories that were significantly different. The modeled deforestation data from OSIRIS-Indonesia version 1.5 showing predicted deforestation in the absence of a REDD+ mechanism (Busch et al. 2010) was exported into ArcGIS 10.1 and resampled to 25 km2 grid cells (from 9 km2). We calculated predicted deforestation per hectare for all grid cells classed as forest in 2010. We extracted predicted deforestation values (percent) for each forested cell and reclassified these into 5 deforestation threat classes (very low to very high) based on natural breaks. Using the zonal statistic function in ArcGIS, we calculated the proportion of REDD+ project area, PAs, and unprotected forests that fell into each deforestation class. Our analyses relied on available data sets, such as vertebrate vector range maps, which tend to overestimate the likelihood of species occurrence. Some species will be absent in fragments, logged forests, and recently deforested areas. We dealt with this by refining the species range maps and confining our analyses to remaining forest area-based on 2012 forest cover map, as suggested by Jenkins et al. (2013). We also assumed that most species persist in logged or secondary forests based on the large body of literature which supports this (e.g., Sitompul et al. 2013; Struebig et al. 2013; Edwards et al. 2014). Our projected deforestation threat was based on econometric modeling. The results are therefore a scenario-specific prediction of where threats are most likely to occur given the defined model assumptions. The model predicts deforestation based on the conversion of forest land to agriculture. Patterns of potential species richness were highly variable from taxon to taxon and depended strongly on the richness measure used. For total species richness, the highest potential vertebrate species richness was in Sumatra; lower potential species richness was to the East of Wallace's Line in Sulawesi and Papua (Fig. 1a). When both plant and vertebrate data were combined (possible for Sundaland only), the highest total richness shifted from lowland Sumatra to lowland Kalimantan (Fig. 1d), and the northern tip of Kalimantan had the highest total potential species richness (>1270 species in a single cell). Threatened vertebrate species richness was distributed differently. The highest potential richness was concentrated in coastal lowlands of Sumatra and submontane regions of Kalimantan (Fig. 1b), whereas Papua had the lowest potential threatened species richness. Potential restricted range species richness was mostly concentrated in the uplands (Java, Sulawesi, and Papua) and the smaller islands of Buru, Seram, and Halmahera in the Wallacea ecoregion (Fig. 1c). Richness patterns for individual taxa and measures of biodiversity are in Supporting Information. Hotspots of biodiversity richness identified based on different measures did not generally overlap, further emphasizing that the identification of areas important for biodiversity depended on the measure used (Fig. 1). For example, when hotspots were defined as the richest 10% of cells, no cells were identified as hotspots for all 3 measures of total species richness (vertebrates and plants). Supporting Information contains additional information on the effects of using different hotspot definitions (5%, 10%, 15%, and 25%). At the national scale, there was some evidence of a negative relationship between organic carbon stock and all 3 measures of terrestrial vertebrate richness (Table 1, Fig. 2). This negative relationship was significant at the 5% level for threatened species richness and restricted range species richness but was not significant for total species richness. However, this relationship did not hold when analyzed for islands independently (Table 1, Fig. 2). The relationship between carbon density and total species richness was either not significant or only weakly correlated for each of the major islands. With the inclusion of plants, results showed a strong negative relationship between carbon and overall species richness in Kalimantan (rs = −0.306, p < 0.001), and Sumatra (rs = −0.516, p < 0.001) (Table 1, Fig. 2d). This result reflected the fact that peat swamp forests store very large amounts of carbon but do not have particularly high overall plant species richness. The relationship between carbon density and threatened species richness was neither strong nor monotonic in any of the 4 major islands (Table 1, Fig. 2b). The relationship was strongest in Java, where the correlation was broadly positive (rs = 0.29, p < 0.001). Montane regions of Kalimantan and Papua coincided with the highest concentrations of restricted range vertebrate species (Fig 2c); however, these regions have relatively low carbon densities. Thus, a generally negative relationship between carbon and restricted range species richness was evident in Kalimantan (rs = −0.075, p = 0.016) and Papua (rs = −0.222, p < 0.001) (Table 2, Fig. 2c). The opposite trend was evident on Java (rs = 0.61, p < 0.001), where there was a nearly monotonic positive relationship between carbon and restricted range vertebrate species (Table 2, Fig. 2c), both of which are confined to remaining upland forests. The relationship between each measure of species richness and carbon was also greatly influenced by which taxa were included in the analyses; for example, restricted range birds (rs = 0.636, p < 0.001) and mammals (rs = 0.49, p < 0.001) in Java had strong positive correlation with carbon, whereas plants had a strong negative correlation with carbon in Sumatra (Supporting Information). We identified 36 active REDD+ projects in 15 provinces of Indonesia (25 projects reported as no longer active). Projects varied in size from site-level activities to those operating at the district or subprovince level. Over half (53%) of the project developers were conservation nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), 33% were private for-profit organizations, and 17% were projects established in collaboration with the Indonesian government or bilateral agencies. At least 25% of REDD+ project centroids overlapped with the boundaries of PAs (Supporting Information). The REDD+ forests tended to have, on average, lower carbon densities (mean = 433.5 t CO2/ha) than PAs (mean = 493.2 t CO2/ha) and unprotected forests in Indonesia (mean = 447.6 t CO2/ha) (Fig. 3a). Mean carbon density did not differ significantly between REDD+ projects and unprotected forests (F = 17.39 on 2877 df, p = 3.1 × 10−8) (Supporting Information). The REDD+ projects had significantly higher potential total vertebrate species richness (F = 130.2 on 2966 df, p = 2 × 10−16) and threatened species richness (F = 152.2 on 2930 df, p = 2 × 10−16) (Figs. 3b & 3c and Supporting Information). This relationship held true when plants were included in the measures of potential species richness (F = 16.35 on 2730 df, p = 8.77 × 10−8) (Supporting Information). Restricted range species showed a very different pattern; REDD+ projects and unprotected forests had on average lower potential species richness per cell than PAs (F = 17.2 on 1631 df, p = 4.07 × 10−8) (Fig. 3d) (Supporting Information). At least 23% (or 2.9 million ha) of the area of REDD+ projects was located in forests that had medium to high predicted deforestation threat, whereas 11% (or 2 million ha) of PA and 21% (or 20 million ha) of unprotected forest were under this level of threat. Forests currently not protected by REDD+ or PAs had a much larger area exposed to high deforestation threats; 1 million ha were predicted to be under very high deforestation threat (10–36% deforestation/ha) (Table 2). We found that patterns of biodiversity identified depended on the measure of biodiversity used; therefore, the protection of forests with the highest species richness (in Sumatra) may not protect forests with the highest number of threatened species (Kalimantan and coastal Sumatra) or restricted range species (highlands and small islands). Patterns of species richness were also highly variable between taxa, as has been demonstrated globally (Grenyer et al. 2006; Jenkins et al. 2013). Therefore, it is not possible for REDD+ projects to be located in such a way as to be good for all measures of biodiversity simultaneously. We found no clear and consistent relationship between carbon and any of our proxy measures of biodiversity in Indonesia, there was a weak negative relationship at the national scale, but relationships within islands were sometimes weakly positive, sometimes nonexistent, and sometimes strongly negative. The lack of a clear relationship between carbon and species richness has also been found in South Africa (Egoh et al. 2009) and Madagascar (Wendland et al. 2010). This is perhaps not surprising because of the fundamental ecological differences (definition and substitutability) between carbon and biodiversity (Potts et al. 2013). There are concerns that a lack of congruence between carbon and biodiversity could result in REDD+ investments focusing on high carbon areas which will put biodiversity at risk (Venter et al. 2009; Harrison & Paoli 2012). Although we did not find congruence between carbon stock densities and biodiversity richness in Indonesia, we also did not find REDD+ projects targeting areas with the highest carbon stocks. Instead, they seemed well positioned to deliver biodiversity gains because they tended to be located in areas with higher potential species richness (of total and threatened species). One factor which may explain why REDD+ projects in Indonesia tended to be located in areas important for biodiversity is that REDD+ development in Indonesia has been spearheaded by conservation NGOs. Such project developers may be seeing REDD+ as a novel funding stream for conservation rather than simply seeking to maximize potential carbon revenues. Our results for Indonesia are consistent with findings from studies in Tanzania (Lin et al. 2014) and Brazil (De Barros et al. 2014), which show evidence of REDD+ initiatives spatially targeting high biodiversity areas. The REDD+ project areas may tend to have lower than average carbon stock because remaining forests outside PAs have mostly been logged (Margono et al. 2014). We also found that many REDD+ projects in our sample are pursuing reforestation and forest restoration as their key project activities, we expect such projects with aims to enhance forest carbon stock to be located in degraded or secondary forests, with perhaps lower than average carbon content. Implementing REDD+ in PAs has been criticized as not being ""additional"" (Macdonald et al. 2011) because supposedly PAs are already conserved. However, given the underfunding of many PAs worldwide, it could be argued that improved funding could result in additional gains (Macdonald et al. 2011). Despite their protected status, many PAs in Indonesia are under continuing threat; over 12% of primary forest loss in Indonesia (2000–2012) is located in PAs (Margono et al. 2014), and enforcement is lax (Gaveau et al. 2012). Similarly, we found that PAs were not completely spared from the threat of deforestation; at least 11% (or >2 million ha) of PA area was in areas predicted to have medium to high deforestation threat. We found evidence that REDD+ is indeed being used to support conservation in Indonesia's PAs; at least 25% of REDD+ project boundaries overlapped with PAs (Supporting Information). If REDD+ funding could be used to increase the effectiveness of PAs, the benefits for biodiversity could be large. The REDD+ projects located adjacent to current PAs could also play an important role in softening the matrix, which would reduce the effective isolation of species in the PAs and improve population viability (Jantz et al. 2014). Peat swamp forests in Indonesia have global importance in climate mitigation and they are highly threatened because they represent the last frontiers for production of food, pulp, and biofuels (Posa et al. 2011). Recent findings show that 43% (2.6 million ha) of primary forest loss in Indonesia (2000–2012) took place in peatlands, which have an overall increasing rate of loss greater than lowland primary forests (Margono et al. 2014). A large number of REDD+ projects are located in carbon-rich peat swamp forests (Harrison & Paoli 2012). We also found this to be true; however, the total area covered by these projects was much smaller than the area covered by projects on mineral soils (Supporting Information). Highly threatened lowland forests, such as those in the lowlands of Borneo and Sumatra, should remain a priority for future REDD+ planning despite having below-average carbon content. Large expanses of selectively logged forests in Indonesia are now degraded and under high threat of conversion because these are prime agriculture lands where the Indonesian government intends to locate future palm-oil plantations in an attempt to divert palm-oil development away from carbon-rich peat swamp forests and pristine mineral soil forests (Gingold 2010). Margono et al. (2014) found that from 2000 to 2012, 98% (15.8 million ha) of forest loss took place in degraded forests. However, even heavily logged forests can be of high conservation value (Struebig et al. 2013). Meijaard and Sheil (2007) estimate that about 75% of Bornean orangutans (Pongo pygmaeus) live in logging concessions, and Sitompul et al. (2013) found that at least 1.6 million ha of Sumatran elephant (Elephas maximus sumatranus) habitat is in active logging concessions or in previously logged areas. These forests contain important biodiversity that would be reduced if they were logged again or cleared for oil palm or pulpwood plantations (Edwards et al. 2012). Opportunities for biodiversity in the REDD+ mechanism do not rely on the spatial congruence between carbon and biodiversity alone. The REDD+ policies are important if biodiversity conservation is to be integrated into the national REDD+ architecture (Phelps et al. 2012). Biodiversity-specific management will need to be incorporated in the planning, design, and implementation of REDD+ on the ground (Martin et al. 2013) because protecting existing forest carbon stocks alone will not automatically protect other forest values (Huettner 2012). Our results show that first-generation REDD+ projects in Indonesia are not necessarily located in the highest threat areas. This is consistent with the findings of Cerbu et al. (2011), who showed that predicted future deforestation appeared to be less of a criteria among first-generation developers for the location of REDD+ projects than the interests of NGOs or government agencies. Early REDD+ projects have built on prior forest management approaches, such as integrated conservation and development projects, as a springboard for REDD+ (Minang & van Noordwijk 2013) and a testing ground for proof of concept (Murdiyarso et al. 2012). The REDD+ projects in our study are in the early stages of development and are operating largely from bilateral REDD+ funding. As the REDD+ mechanism develops, the conditions under which project location is selected will differ; the non-colocation of carbon and biodiversity priority areas in Indonesia highlights an important structural feature which will affect the cost of delivering biodiversity cobenefits in future REDD+ projects. It can be assumed, based on our findings, that REDD+ projects located in forests most important for biodiversity will cost more per unit of carbon delivered than those located in high carbon forests because forests with the highest biodiversity tend to have low carbon densities but high threat to future deforestation due to high agriculture rent (Busch et al. 2010). Our results show that expanding REDD+ in forest with the lowest deforestation threat (generally on cheaper land) will have low incremental benefits for both biodiversity and carbon. We recommend that future research explicitly assess the costs associated with locating REDD+ projects in forests most important for biodiversity conservation, in light of the limited colocation between carbon and biodiversity we found. A future regulatory mechanism is likely to focus on cost-effective delivery of carbon benefits and not the large-scale delivery of noncarbon benefits (Busch 2013). Biodiversity conservation in the context of REDD+ is therefore likely to require additional investment (Phelps et al. 2012). Options include the introduction of premiums for the delivery of biodiversity benefits (Dinerstein et al. 2013), to allow REDD+ credits to protect forests that are carbon priorities, and use of supplementary funds to protect biodiversity priority areas even when they exhibit low carbon content (Venter et al. 2013). It is an empirical question which of these strategies would be more cost-effective under different contextual preconditions. We found that patterns of biodiversity varied strongly among taxa and depended on the measure of biodiversity. It would therefore not be possible to place REDD+ projects in areas which are universally good for all measures of biodiversity. In Indonesia carbon stocks correlate poorly with all measures of biodiversity both at the national level and within major islands. However, REDD+ projects under development in Indonesia were located in areas with below-average carbon stock but relatively high biodiversity (according to most measures we used), possibly reflecting the prominent role of conservation NGOs in the development of these first-generation REDD+ projects. Although nearly one-quarter of REDD+ project area was located where deforestation threat was predicted to be relatively high, the majority of REDD+ project area was not in highly threatened forests. This limits the opportunity to achieve the greatest benefits for both emissions reductions and biodiversity conservation. The patterns of biodiversity, threat, and locations of REDD+ projects in Indonesia suggest that biodiversity cobenefits could be achieved through REDD+ in Indonesia, especially if future expansion focused on areas under high deforestation threat. As the world looks toward a global mechanism to address climate change to be agreed upon at the 21st Conference of Parties in Paris at the end of 2015, our findings make an important contribution to debates surrounding the design of REDD+ to maximize the potential for cobenefits. The realized benefits of any REDD+ network will, of course, depend not only on the design and spatial planning but also on the effectiveness of interventions on the ground. We acknowledge G. S.

",,,,"The Galapagos Islands are renowned for their high degree of endemism. Marine taxa inhabiting the archipelago might be expected to be an exception, because of their utilization of pelagic habitats-the dispersal barrier for terrestrial taxa-as foraging grounds. Magnificent frigatebirds (Fregata magnificens) have a highly vagile lifestyle and wide geographical distribution around the South and Central American coasts. Given the potentially high levels of gene flow among populations, the species provides a good test of the effectiveness of the Galapagos ecosystem in isolating populations of highly dispersive marine species. We studied patterns of genetic (mitochondrial DNA, microsatellites and nuclear introns) and morphological variation across the distribution of magnificent frigatebirds. Concordant with predictions from life-history traits, we found signatures of extensive gene flow over most of the range, even across the Isthmus of Panama, which is a major barrier to gene flow in other tropical seabirds. In contrast, individuals from the Galapagos were strongly differentiated from all conspecifics, and have probably been isolated for several hundred thousand years. Our finding is a powerful testimony to the evolutionary uniqueness of the taxa inhabiting the Galapagos archipelago and its associated marine ecosystems.

",,,,"ABSTRACT Rapid losses and degradation of natural habitats in the tropics are driving catastrophic declines and extinctions of native biotas, including angiosperms. Determining the ecological and life‐history correlates of extinction proneness in tropical plant species may help reveal the mechanisms underlying their responses to habitat disturbance, and assist in the pre‐emptive identification of species at risk from extinction. We determined the predictors of extinction proneness in 1884 locally extinct ( n = 454) and extant ( n = 1430) terrestrial angiosperms (belonging to 43 orders, 133 families, and 689 genera) in the tropical island nation of Singapore (699.4 km 2 ), which has lost 99.6% of its primary lowland evergreen rainforest since 1819. A wide variety of traits such as geographical distribution, pollination system, sexual system, habit, habitat, height, fruit/seed dispersal mechanism, and capacity for vegetative re‐sprouting were used in the analysis. Despite controlling for phylogeny (as approximated by family level classification), we found that only a small percentage of the variation in the extinction probability could be explained by these factors. Epiphytic, monoecious, and hermaphroditic species and those restricted to inland forests have higher probabilities of extinction. Species dependent on mammal pollinators also probably have higher extinction probabilities. More comparative studies that use species traits to identify extinction‐prone plant species are needed to guide the enormous, but essential task of identifying species most in need of conservation action.

",,,,"Conservation organisations and governments often use charismatic megafauna as surrogates to represent broader biodiversity. While these species are primarily selected as “flagships” for marketing campaigns, it is important to evaluate their surrogacy potential, i.e. the extent to which their protection benefits other biodiversity elements. Four charismatic megafauna species are used as surrogates in the megadiverse island of Sumatra: the Sumatran tiger Panthera tigris sumatrae, Sumatran elephant Elephas maximus sumatranus, Sumatran orangutan Pongo abelii and Sumatran rhinoceros Dicerorhinus sumatrensis. We examined how well each of these species performed in representing the distribution of all co-occurring terrestrial mammal species on the island, and the priority areas for the conservation of three facets of mammalian biodiversity (taxonomic, phylogenetic and functional).
We used habitat suitability models to represent the distribution of 184 terrestrial mammal species, 160 phylogenetic groups and 74 functional trait groups. We then identified priority conservation areas using the spatial prioritisation software Zonation.
We found that the habitat overlap between each of the four charismatic species and the other mammal species varied, ranging from a mean of 52% (SD = 27%) for the tiger to 2% (SD = 2%) for the rhino. Combining the four species together improved the representation levels only marginally compared to using the tiger only. Among the four charismatic megafauna species, the extent of suitable habitat of Sumatran tiger covered the highest proportion of priority conservation areas. The Sumatran tiger also outperformed most of other mammal species with similar range sizes.
We found that some of the top-ranked conservation areas for taxonomic (28%), phylogenetic (8%) and functional diversity (19%) did not overlap with any of the charismatic species’ suitable habitat.
Synthesis and applications. Wide-ranging charismatic species can represent broader mammalian biodiversity, but they may miss some key areas with high biodiversity importance. We suggest that a combination of systematic spatial prioritisation and surrogacy analyses are important in order to determine the allocation of conservation resources in biodiversity-rich areas such as Sumatra, where an expansion of the protected area network is required.","0021-8901

Seventeen species are recorded in Siargao Island for the first time, representing 45.9% of all collected species, thus, validating that orthopterans in the island are indeed overlooked.

",,,,"Until recently the Antarctic continent and Peninsula have been little impacted by non-native species, compared to other regions of the Earth. However, reports of species introductions are increasing as awareness of biological invasions as a major conservation threat, within the context of increased human activities and climate change scenarios, has grown within the Antarctic community. Given the recent increase in documented reports, here we provide an up-to-date inventory of known terrestrial non-native species introductions, including those subsequently removed since the 1990s, within the Antarctic Treaty area. This builds on earlier syntheses of records published in the mid-2000s, which focused largely on the sub-Antarctic islands, given the dearth of literature available at that time from the continental and maritime Antarctic regions. Reports of non-native species established in the natural environment (i.e. non-synanthropic) are mainly located within the Antarctic Peninsula region and Scotia Arc, with Deception Island, South Shetland Islands, the most impacted area. Non-native plants have generally been removed from sites of introduction, but no established invertebrates have yet been subject to any eradication attempt, despite a recent increase in reports. Legislation within the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty has not kept pace with environmental best practice, potentially presenting difficulties for the practical aspects of non-native species control and eradication. The success of any eradication attempt may be affected by management practices and the biology of the target species under polar conditions. Practical management action is only likely to succeed with greater co-operation and improved communication and engagement by nations and industries operating in the region.

",,,,"Abstract Aim To document ectoparasitic arthropods of terrestrial vertebrates inhabiting barrier islands and to offer preliminary interpretations. Location The coast of Georgia, USA, with most data presented for St Catherines, Sapelo, Jekyll, and Cumberland islands. Methods Ectoparasites were collected and identified from hundreds of live‐trapped mammals, birds, and reptiles. Ticks and louse‐flies were also collected by dragging or flagging a white cloth through vegetation. Some ectoparasites were recovered from host nests or roosting sites. Literature records and specimen records from the US National Tick Collection supplemented these data. Results Inventories of ectoparasite species recovered from vertebrates on each island are provided. Many new records and a small number of undescribed species are reported. Main conclusions Compared with most ectoparasite faunas associated with the same host species on the adjacent mainland, ectoparasite species diversity on the barrier islands is depauperate. Possible reasons for this phenomenon are discussed including ecological, geological, and vicariant factors. Tick faunas do not appear to be depauperate on the islands probably because immature stages attach to visiting or migrating birds. Some host‐ectoparasite associations that we recorded are atypical for mainland faunas. This trend has also been recorded in some previous surveys of insular ectoparasites and may be related to vacant ectoparasite niches on some islands.

",,"Cambridge University Press
",,,,"The terrestrial vegetation in Antarctica is restricted to small, very isolated, ice-free areas on the continent and on the islands adjacent to the Peninsula region. Lichens, a symbiosis between a fungus and an alga or cyanobacterium, form the most prominent component in the vegetation. They have the greatest number of species compared with other cryptogamic and unicellular organisms. They are able to colonize all types of solid substrata and have a low mineral nutrient demand. Their physiological vigour is derived from high freezing tolerance and the ability to be photosynthetically activated by water vapour uptake from snow at temperatures as low as c. -20°C. Long-term monitoring in their natural habitats demonstrates that lichens are photosynthetically active at suboptimal temperatures. Locally, however, they can benefit from meltwater on insolated rocks, but only for short periods in early summer. Although at this time they may be exposed to substrate temperatures of > 20°C and strong light they do not suffer from photostress. If, in winter, lichens are covered and kept dark by snow with temperatures close to 0°C, lichens enter a negative carbon balance. This effect may be relevant to lichens under conditions of global or regional warming.","0954-1020

",,,,"We studied the non-marine reptile and amphibian species of the volcanic Comoro archipelago in the Western Indian Ocean, a poorly known island herpetofauna comprising numerous microendemic species of potentially high extinction risk and widespread, non-endemic and often invasive taxa. According to our data, the Comoro islands are inhabited by two amphibian species and at least 28 species of reptiles although ongoing genetic studies and unconfirmed historical records suggest an even higher species diversity. 14 of the 28 currently recognized species of terrestrial reptiles (50%) and the two amphibians are endemic to a single island or to the Comoro archipelago. The majority of species are most abundant at low elevation. However, a few endemic species, like the gekkonid lizards Paroedura sanctijohannis and Phelsuma nigristriata, are more common in or even confined to higher altitudes. We created habitat maps from remotely sensed data in combination with detailed species distribution maps produced using comprehensive data from field surveys between 2000 and 2010, literature, and historical locality records based on specimens in zoological collections. Using these data, we assessed the conservation status of the endemic terrestrial reptiles and amphibians according to the IUCN Red List criteria. Our results show that although little area of natural forest remains on the Comoros, many species are abundant in degraded forest or plantations. Competition and predation by invasive species appears to be the most important threat factor for the endemic herpetofauna, together with habitat degradation and destruction, which further favours invasive species. We propose the status Endangered for three species, Vulnerable for one species, Near Threatened for six species, Least Concern for four and Data Deficient for two species. The endemic subspecies Oplurus cuvieri comorensis is proposed for the status Critically Endangered. Based on the results of this study, seven areas of importance for reptile and amphibian conservation on the Comoros are identified. This study shows how remote sensing data can contribute to increasing accuracy and objectiveness of conservation assessments.

",,,,"Biodiversity in the Solomon Islands Is extremely rich, and in the Pacific is second only to Papua New Guinea. Despite this high diversity there are only rough estimates for the biodiversity of most taxa in the Solomon Islands. As part of a terrestrial biodiversity survey, we conducted nocturnal surveys for frogs in a range of habitats from 10?1 060 m on Choiseul Island. This work was carried out between June 2005 and January 2006. In addition to the nocturnal surveys, we also conducted opportunistic diurnal searches for reptiles as well as community environmental education and awareness workshops. Fifteen frog species (65% of all Solomon Island frogs) including all five endemic species, were found during our surveys of Choiseul Island. Most of the species were fairly widespread and abundant, however, four species (Discodeles bufoniformis, Palmatorrapia solomonis, Brachylodes trossulus and B. wolfi) were fairly restricted in their distribution. In addition, we found 20 reptile species during opportunistic surveys (30% of all Solomon Island reptiles Including four endemics). Important habitats on Choiseul Island based on frog species richness and abundance are mid-altitude rainforest (500?600 m), primary lowland rainforest and lowland coastal forest. Unfortunately, it is these habitats that are most threatened by logging operations on the island. In order to aid biodiversity conservation on Choiseul Island we recommend a number of activities including additional biodiversity surveys, increased community awareness and education about biodiversity and the impacts of logging, and the drawing up of a management plan including all terrestrial taxa for Choiseul Island forests.","1038-2097

",,,,"The impact of alien American mink on the native fauna of oceanic islands has been demonstrated in a number of locations. In the sub-Antarctic Cape Horn Biosphere Reserve of southern Chile the species is currently expanding in an area where the native fauna evolved in the absence of terrestrial predators. To evaluate any emerging problems we therefore investigated seasonal variation in prey use by mink on Navarino Island within the Reserve. We identified undigested remains in 414 scats collected from the shores of 27 ponds over January–November 2006. Diet consisted mainly of mammals and birds. Mammals, including both native and exotic rodents, were the predominant prey in all seasons but birds were of equal importance during the summer (when birds breed and their abundance and diversity increases on the island). Exotic rodents were the only identifiable mammalian prey item during winter. Native wetland birds constituted a substantial proportion of mink diet, and greater than that reported in other areas. Many birds breeding on Navarino Island are ground-nesting, a strategy that evolved in the absence of native mammalian predators. Considering the international importance of this region, our results emphasize the need for an assessment of the impact of mink predation on the populations of native prey.

",,,,"After nearly a decade of field inventories in which we preserved voucher specimens of the small terrestrial mammals of Sulawesi, we combined qualitative and quantitative analyses of morphological traits with molecular phylogenetics to better understand the diversity of shrews (Soricidae: Crocidura) on the island. We examined the morphology of 1368 specimens and obtained extensive molecular data from many of them, including mitochondrial DNA sequences from 851 specimens, up to five nuclear exons from 657 specimens, and thousands of ultraconserved elements from 90 specimens. By iteratively testing species limits using distinct character datasets and appropriate taxon sampling, we found clear, mostly consistent evidence for the existence of 21 species of shrews on Sulawesi, only seven of which were previously recognized. We divide these 21 species into five morphogroups, provide emended diagnoses of the seven previously named species, and describe 14 new species. The Long-Tailed Group contains Crocidura caudipilosa, C. elongata, C. microelongata, new species, and C. quasielongata, new species; the Rhoditis Group contains C. rhoditis, C. pseudorhoditis, new species, C. australis, new species, and C. pallida, new species; the Small-Bodied Group contains C. lea, C. levicula, C. baletei, new species, C. mediocris, new species, C. parva, new species, and C. tenebrosa, new species; the Thick-Tailed Group contains C. brevicauda, new species and C. caudicrassa, new species; and the Ordinary Group contains C. musseri, C. nigripes, C. normalis, new species, C. ordinaria, new species, and C. solita, new species. Documenting these endemic species reveals a local radiation (20 of the 21 species are members of an endemic clade) in which elevational gradients played a prominent role in either promoting speciation, or at a minimum, fostering the cooccurrence of phenotypically similar species. As now understood, the species-level diversity of Crocidura on Sulawesi is nearly three times the known diversity of any other insular shrew fauna. This study highlights the fact that if we wish to understand the true extent of biodiversity on Earth, large-scale, vouchered organismal inventories followed up with thorough examinations of genetic, morphological, and geographic traits are sorely needed in montane tropical regions, even for purportedly well-studied groups such as mammals.

",,,,"Fauna Europaea provides a public web-service with an index of scientific names (including important synonyms) of all extant multicellular European terrestrial and freshwater animals and their geographical distribution at the level of countries and major islands (east of the Urals and excluding the Caucasus region). The Fauna Europaea project comprises about 230,000 taxonomic names, including 130,000 accepted species and 14,000 accepted subspecies, which is much more than the originally projected number of 100,000 species. Fauna Europaea represents a huge effort by more than 400 contributing taxonomic specialists throughout Europe and is a unique (standard) reference suitable for many user communities in science, government, industry, nature conservation and education. The Diptera-Brachycera is one of the 58 Fauna Europaea major taxonomic groups, and data have been compiled by a network of 55 specialists. Within the two-winged insects (Diptera), the Brachycera constitute a monophyletic group, which is generally given rank of suborder. The Brachycera may be classified into the probably paraphyletic 'lower brachyceran grade' and the monophyletic Eremoneura. The latter contains the Empidoidea, the Apystomyioidea with a single Nearctic species, and the Cyclorrhapha, which in turn is divided into the paraphyletic 'aschizan grade' and the monophyletic Schizophora. The latter is traditionally divided into the paraphyletic 'acalyptrate grade' and the monophyletic Calyptratae. Our knowledge of the European fauna of Diptera-Brachycera varies tremendously among families, from the reasonably well known hoverflies (Syrphidae) to the extremely poorly known scuttle flies (Phoridae). There has been a steady growth in our knowledge of European Diptera for the last two centuries, with no apparent slow down, but there is a shift towards a larger fraction of the new species being found among the families of the nematoceran grade (lower Diptera), which due to a larger number of small-sized species may be considered as taxonomically more challenging. Most of Europe is highly industrialised and has a high human population density, and the more fertile habitats are extensively cultivated. This has undoubtedly increased the extinction risk for numerous species of brachyceran flies, yet with the recent re-discovery of Thyreophoracynophila (Panzer), there are no known cases of extinction at a European level. However, few national Red Lists have extensive information on Diptera. For the Diptera-Brachycera, data from 96 families containing 11,751 species are included in this paper.

",,,,"The Azores is a remote oceanic archipelago of nine islands which belongs to the Macaronesia biogeographical region hosting a unique biodiversity. The present Azorean landscape is strongly modified by the presence of man and only in small areas, where the soil or climate was too rough, have primitive conditions remained unchanged. Despite the fact that most of the Azorean native habitats are now lost, a large number of endemic species are still present and need urgent conservation. The present checklist of terrestrial and freshwater arthropods of the Azores Archipelago is based on all known published literature. The main goal of this work is to list, as rigorously as possible, all the known terrestrial and freshwater arthropods of the Azores. In this way, we are contributing to solve the ‘Linnaean’ shortfall, i.e. an incomplete taxonomic description of species-level diversity and the Wallacean Biodiversity Shortfall, the incomplete species distribution knowledge. The checklist includes new records of arthropods at island and archipelago levels that were published in the last twelve years. Compared to the last checklist of Azorean arthropods (Borges et al. 2010b), a total of 217 taxa (species and subspecies) are added. Currently, the total number of terrestrial and freshwater arthropod species and subspecies in the Azores is estimated to be 2420 taxa belonging to 14 classes, 53 orders, 440 families, 1556 genera, 2400 species and 149 individual subspecies. The most diverse orders of Azorean arthropods are: Coleoptera (585 taxa), Diptera (423 taxa), Hemiptera (338 taxa), Hymenoptera (163 taxa), Lepidoptera (159 taxa) and Araneae (133 taxa). A total of 276 endemic taxa are currently known (232 species and 44 subspecies), belonging to eight classes and 22 orders. São Miguel, Terceira and Pico are the islands with higher number of endemic species and subspecies. In the Azores, the number of native non-endemic taxa is 793 taxa, totalling 1069 indigenous taxa. Compared to the other nearest Macaronesian archipelagos (Madeira and Canaries), the Azorean arthropod fauna is characterised by a lower percentage of endemism (endemics/indigenous: 26% in Azores, 47% in Madeira Archipelago and 42% in Canary Islands) and a high proportion of exotic introduced taxa (39% in Azores, 19% in Madeira Archipelago and 8% in Canary Islands). Based on recent IUCN Red-listing of Azorean arthropods, a large fraction of the endemic taxa is under high threat.

",,,,"Background The complex history of Southeast Asian islands has long been of interest to biogeographers. Dispersal and vicariance events in the Pleistocene have received the most attention, though recent studies suggest a potentially more ancient history to components of the terrestrial fauna. Among this fauna is the enigmatic archaeobatrachian frog genus Barbourula, which only occurs on the islands of Borneo and Palawan. We utilize this lineage to gain unique insight into the temporal history of lineage diversification in Southeast Asian islands. Methodology/Principal Findings Using mitochondrial and nuclear genetic data, multiple fossil calibration points, and likelihood and Bayesian methods, we estimate phylogenetic relationships and divergence times for Barbourula. We determine the sensitivity of focal divergence times to specific calibration points by jackknife approach in which each calibration point is excluded from analysis. We find that relevant divergence time estimates are robust to the exclusion of specific calibration points. Barbourula is recovered as a monophyletic lineage nested within a monophyletic Costata. Barbourula diverged from its sister taxon Bombina in the Paleogene and the two species of Barbourula diverged in the Late Miocene. Conclusions/Significance The divergences within Barbourula and between it and Bombina are surprisingly old and represent the oldest estimates for a cladogenetic event resulting in living taxa endemic to Southeast Asian islands. Moreover, these divergence time estimates are consistent with a new biogeographic scenario: the Palawan Ark Hypothesis. We suggest that components of Palawan's terrestrial fauna might have ""rafted"" on emergent portions of the North Palawan Block during its migration from the Asian mainland to its present-day position near Borneo. Further, dispersal from Palawan to Borneo (rather than Borneo to Palawan) may explain the current day disjunct distribution of this ancient lineage.

",,"Royal Society
",,,,"Populations of terrestrial or freshwater taxa that are separated by oceans can be explained by either oceanic dispersal or fragmentation of a previously contiguous land mass. Amphisbaenians, the worm lizards (approx. 165 species), are small squamate reptiles that are uniquely adapted to a burrowing lifestyle and inhabit Africa, South America, Caribbean Islands, North America, Europe and the Middle East. All but a few species are limbless and they rarely leave their subterranean burrows. Given their peculiar habits, the distribution of amphisbaenians has been assumed to be primarily the result of two land-mass fragmentation events: the split of the supercontinent Pangaea starting 200 Myr ago, separating species on the northern land mass (Laurasia) from those on the southern land mass (Gondwana), and the split of South America from Africa 100 Myr ago. Here we show with molecular evidence that oceanic dispersal-on floating islands-played a more prominent role, and that amphisbaenians crossed the Atlantic Ocean in the Eocene (40 Myr ago) resulting in a tropical American radiation representing one-half of all known amphisbaenian species. Until now, only four or five transatlantic dispersal events were known in terrestrial vertebrates. Significantly, this is the first such dispersal event to involve a group that burrows, an unexpected lifestyle for an oceanic disperser.

",,,,"Considering the growing threats to the biodiversity of small Caribbean islands (e.g., habitat loss and fragmentation, overexploitation, invasive species, and climate change), it is important to establish biodiversity inventories that serve as baselines for monitoring and evaluation of conservation efforts. In Barbados (West Indies), the most recent comprehensive taxonomic account of brachyuran crabs came from Rathbun (1921) reporting the specimens collected by the University of Iowa Barbados-Antigua Expedition in 1918. The present study fills the 100-year gap in knowledge by providing an updated taxonomic checklist of brachyuran crabs associated with semi-terrestrial and estuarine habitats in Barbados. A total of 245 specimens representing three superfamilies, six families, nine genera, and 13 species were collected over a period of 425 search-hours in twenty-seven sampling locations in semi-terrestrial and estuarine habitats of Barbados between September 2018 and November 2020. The families with the highest numbers of species identified were Gecarcinidae (3) and Portunidae (3), followed by Grapsidae (2), Sesarmidae (2), Ocypodidae (2), and Varunidae (1). The species Armases ricordi (H. Milne Edwards, 1853), Cyclograpsus integer H. Milne Edwards, 1837, and Callinectes sapidus Rathbun, 1896, are recorded here for the first time for Barbados.","1175-5326

",,,,"Aim To explore the determinants of island occupancy of 48 terrestrial bird species in an oceanic archipelago, accounting for ecological components while controlling for phylogenetic effects.

Location The seven main islands of the Canary archipelago.

Methods We obtained field data on population density, habitat breadth and landscape distribution in Tenerife, Fuerteventura and La Palma, aiming to sample all available habitats and the gradient of altitudes. In total, 1715 line transects of 0.5 km were carried out during the breeding season. We also reviewed the literature for data on occupancy, the distance between the Canary Islands and the nearest distribution border on the mainland, body size and endemicity of the 48 terrestrial bird species studied. Phylogenetic eigenvector regression was used to quantify (and to control for) the amount of phylogenetic signal.

Results  The two measurements of occupancy (number of occupied islands or 10 × 10 km UTM squares) were tightly correlated and produced very similar results. The occupancy of the terrestrial birds of the Canary Islands during the breeding season had a very low phylogenetic effect. Species with broader habitat breadth, stronger preferences for urban environments, smaller body size, and a lower degree of endemicity had a broader geographical distribution in the archipelago, occupying a larger number of islands and 10 × 10 UTM squares.

Main conclusions The habitat-generalist species with a tolerance for novel urban environments tend to be present on more islands and to occupy a greater area, whereas large-sized species that are genetically differentiated within the islands are less widespread. Therefore, some properties of the ranges of these species are explicable from basic biological features. A positive relationship of range size with local abundance, previously shown in continental studies, was not found, probably because it relies on free dispersal on continuous landmasses, which may not be applicable on oceanic islands.","0305-0270

",,"Wiley
",,,,"Aim
Phylogenetic endemism (PE) identifies geographic concentrations of evolutionarily isolated and spatially restricted biota. Locations with high PE hold elements of biodiversity with little representation elsewhere and whose loss would impact disproportionately on phylogenetic diversity. We aim to determine the global distribution of PE for the world's mammals and to test hypotheses regarding the role of past and present environment and isolation in creating current patterns of evolutionary and spatial isolation.

Location
Global land.

Methods
IUCN range polygons were combined with a mammal supertree to estimate PE and related measures at three resolutions. We tested the relationship between PE and predictors representing current and Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) environment and isolation in a model selection framework, for all terrestrial mammals and separately for bats.

Results
We identified 12 centres of mammal PE, with implications for conservation decisions. Endemism of mammal evolutionary diversity peaks predominantly in tropical and Southern Hemisphere island and montane regions. PE was most strongly associated with energy availability, isolation, elevation and low variability of current climate. Post LGM climate stability was a surprisingly weak predictor of PE compared with LGM climate itself. When controlling for current species ranges, PE is more strongly explained by past climate and past isolation.

Main conclusions
While present conditions better explain species endemism, past climate and isolation are central to explaining PE. Isolation at the LGM was a significantly stronger predictor of PE than current isolation, confirming the key role of persistent barriers, even narrow ones such as Wallace's Line. This global evaluation of PE offers an innovative and effective way to capture and test the evolutionary underpinning of whole-clade biogeography. With improving spatial and phylogenetic information, integrative measures such as PE offer a substantial contribution toward comprehending and conserving evolutionary diversity.","1466-822X

",,,,"The island of Newfoundland is unique because it has as many non-native terrestrial mammals as native ones. The impacts of non-native species on native flora and fauna can be profound and invasive species have been identified as one of the primary drivers of species extinction. Few studies, however, have investigated the effects of a non-native species assemblage on community and ecosystem properties. We reviewed the literature to build the first terrestrial mammal food web for the island of Newfoundland and then used network analyses to investigate how the timing of introductions and trophic position of non-native species has affected the structure of the terrestrial mammal food web in Newfoundland. The first non-native mammals (house mouse and brown rat) became established in Newfoundland with human settlement in the late 15th and early 16th centuries. Coyotes and southern red-backed voles are the most recent mammals to establish themselves on the island in 1985 and 1998, respectively. The fraction of intermediate species increased with the addition of non-native mammals over time whereas the fraction of basal and top species declined over time. This increase in intermediate species mediated by non-native species arrivals led to an overall increase in the terrestrial mammal food web connectance and generality (i.e. mean number of prey per predator). This diverse prey base and sources of carrion may have facilitated the natural establishment of coyotes on the island. Also, there is some evidence that the introduction of non-native prey species such as the southern red-backed vole has contributed to the recovery of the threatened American marten. Long-term monitoring of the food web is required to understand and predict the impacts of the diverse novel interactions that are developing in the terrestrial mammal food web of Newfoundland.

",,,,"Cyanobacteria are among the most diverse morphological microorganisms that inhabit a great variety of habitats. Their presence in the Azores, a volcanic archipelago of nine islands in the middle of the North Atlantic Ocean, has already been reported. However, due to the high diversity of cyanobacteria habitats, their biodiversity is still understudied, mainly in extreme environments. To address this, a total of 156 cyanobacteria strains from Azores lakes, streams, thermal and terrestrial habitats were isolated. Identification was made based on a polyphasic approach using classical taxonomy (morphological characteristics and environmental data) and phylogeny among 81 strains assessed by maximum likelihood and Bayesian analysis of 16S rDNA partial sequences. The 156 isolates showed a high genera diversity (38) belonging to the orders Chroococcales, Nostocales, Oscillatoriales, and Synechococcales. Eleven new genera for the Azores habitats are here reported, reinforcing that cyanobacteria biodiversity in these islands is still much understudied. Phylogenetic analysis showed 14 clusters associated with these cyanobacteria orders, with evidence for six new genera and valuable information towards Microchaete/Coleospermum taxonomic revision that better reflects species environmental distribution. These results emphasize the need for cyanobacteria taxonomy revisions, through polyphasic studies, mainly in Synechococcales order and in the Microchaete/Coleospermum, Nostoc, and Anabaena genera.

",,,,"Compared to the striking diversification and levels of endemism observed in many terrestrial groups within the Hawaiian Archipelago, marine invertebrates exhibit remarkably lower rates of endemism and diversification. Supralittoral invertebrates restricted to specific coastal patchy habitats, however, have the potential for high levels of allopatric diversification. This is the case of Ligia isopods endemic to the Hawaiian Archipelago, which most likely arose from a rocky supralittoral ancestor that colonized the archipelago via rafting, and diversified into rocky supralittoral and inland lineages. A previous study on populations of this isopod from Oʻahu and Kauaʻi revealed high levels of allopatric differentiation, and suggested inter-island historical dispersal events have been rare. To gain a better understanding on the diversity and evolution of this group, we expanded prior phylogeographic work by incorporating populations from unsampled main Hawaiian Islands (Maui, Molokaʻi, Lanaʻi, and Hawaiʻi), increasing the number of gene markers (four mitochondrial and two nuclear genes), and conducting Maximum likelihood and Bayesian phylogenetic analyses. Our study revealed new lineages and expanded the distribution range of several lineages. The phylogeographic patterns of Ligia in the study area are complex, with Hawaiʻi, Oʻahu, and the Maui-Nui islands sharing major lineages, implying multiple inter-island historical dispersal events. In contrast, the oldest and most geographically distant of the major islands (Kauaʻi) shares no lineages with the other islands. Our results did not support the monophyly of all the supralittoral lineages (currently grouped into L. hawaiensis), or the monophyly of the terrestrial lineages (currently grouped into L. perkinsi), implying more than one evolutionary transition between coastal and inland forms. Geometric-morphometric analyses of three supralittoral clades revealed significant body shape differences among them. A taxonomic revision of Hawaiian Ligia is warranted. Our results are relevant for the protection of biodiversity found in an environment subject to high pressure from disturbances.

",,,,"Much of the world's terrestrial landscapes are being altered by humans in the form of agriculture, urbanization and pastoral systems, with major implications for biodiversity. Bumble bees are one of the most effective pollinators in both natural and cultivated landscapes, but are often the first to be extirpated in human-altered habitats. Yet, little is known about the role of natural and human-altered habitats in promoting or limiting bumble bee gene flow. In this study, I closely examine the genetic structure of the yellow-faced bumble bee, Bombus vosnesenskii, across the southwestern US coast and find strong evidence that natural oceanic barriers, as well as contemporary human-altered habitats, limit bee gene flow. Heterozygosity and allelic richness were lower in island populations, while private allelic richness was higher in island populations compared to mainland populations. Genetic differentiation, measured for three indices across the 1000 km study region, was significantly greater than the null expectation (FST = 0.041, F’ST = 0.044 and Dest = 0.155) and correlated with geographic distance. Furthermore, genetic differentiation patterns were most strongly correlated with contemporary (2011) not past (2006, 2001) resistance maps calibrated for high dispersal limitation over oceans, impervious habitat and croplands. Despite the incorporation of dramatic elevation gradients, the analyses reveal that oceans and contemporary human land use, not mountains, are the primary dispersal barriers for B. vosnesenskii gene flow. These findings reinforce the importance of maintaining corridors of suitable habitat across the distribution range of native pollinators to promote their persistence and safeguard their ability to provide essential pollination services.","0962-1083

",,,,"Question: How does geothermal activity influence terrestrial plant colonization, species composition and community development in the Antarctic?

Location: South Sandwich Islands, maritime Antarctic.

Methods: Bryophytes were documented during a biological survey of the archipelago in January and February 1997. Particular attention was given to sites under current or recent influence of geothermal activity. Temperature profiles obtained across defined areas of activity on several islands were linked with the presence of specific bryophytes.

Results: Greatest bryophyte richness was associated with geothermally influenced ground. Of 35 moss and nine liverwort species recorded, only four mosses were never associated with heated ground, while eight of the liverworts and 50% of the mosses were found only on actively or recently heated ground. Some species occur in unheated sites elsewhere in the maritime Antarctic, but were absent from such habitats on the South Sandwich Islands. Several species occurred in distinct zones around fumaroles. Maximum temperatures recorded within the upper 0.5 cm of the vegetation surface were 40 - 47 °C, with only Campylopus introflexus tolerating such temperatures. Maximum temperatures 2.5 or 5 cm below the vegetation surface of this moss reached 75 °C. Other bryophytes regularly present in zoned vegetation included the mosses Dicranella hookeri, Sanionia georgico-uncinata, Pohlia nutans and Notoligotrichum trichodon, and the liverworts Cryptochila grandiflora and Marchantia berteroana. Surface temperatures of 25 - 35 °C and subsurface temperatures of 50 - 60 °C were recorded in these species.

Conclusions: These exceptional plant communities illustrate the transport of viable propagules into the Antarctic. Individually ephemeral in nature, the longer term existence of geothermal habitats on islands along the Scotia Arc may have provided refugia during periods of glacial expansion, facilitating subsequent recolonization of Antarctic terrestrial habitats.","1100-9233

Species experienced high extinction rates on small islands and during initial colonization, but there was no observable effect of isolation on species immigration rates, nor was there a difference in immigration and extinction rates between hervivores and predators/parasites. Whithin-island similarity on refaunated islands changed rapidly during the 20 weeks following defaunation, and changed slowly, but measurably thereafter. The distributions of species persistence, frequency of occurrence and proportional time present reflect the temporal and spatial patterns observed at the species, island, and archipelage levels. Turnover on the islands was neither totally homogeneous across all species nor completely heterogeneous; some species turned over more frequently than others regardless of island size or isolation, but most of the species in the pool were involved in turnover throughout the archipelago. The evidence suggests that this system is truly insular for the species involved, and that most of the turnover demonstrated on these islands was real, and not a result of sampling error.","0305-0270

",,,,"The concept of optimal size has been invoked to explain patterns in body size of terrestrial mammals. However, the generality of this phenomenon has not been tested with similarly complete data from other taxonomic groups. In this study we describe three statistical patterns of body size in snakes, all of which indicate an optimal length of 1.0 m. First, a distribution of largest body lengths of 618 snake species had a single mode at 1.0 m. Second, we found a positive relationship between the size of the largest member of an island snake assemblage and island area and a negative relationship between the size of the smallest member of an island snake assemblage and island area. Best-fit lines through these data cross at a point corresponding to 1.0 m in body length, the presumed optimal size for a one-species island. Third, mainland snake species smaller than 1.0 m become larger on islands whereas those larger than 1.0 m become smaller on islands. The observation that all three analyses converge on a common body size is concordant with patterns observed in mammals and partial analyses of four other disparate animal clades. Because snakes differ so strikingly from mammals (ectotherms, gape-limited predators, elongate body shape) the concordant patterns of these two groups provide strong evidence for the evolution of an optimal body size within independent monophyletic groups. However, snakes differ from other taxonomic groups that have been studied in exhibiting a body size distribution that is not obviously skewed in either direction. We suggest that idiosyncratic features of the natural history of ectotherms allow relatively unconstrained distributions of body size whereas physiological limitations of endotherms constrain distributions of body size to a right skew.

The expansion of grasslands at the cost of biodiverse forest biomes in Madagascar is often postulated as a consequence of the Holocene settlement of the island by humans. However, we show that the Malagasy grass flora has many indications of being ancient with a long local evolutionary history, much predating the Holocene arrival of humans. First, the level of endemism in the Madagascar grass flora is well above the global average for large islands. Second, a survey of many of the more diverse areas indicates that there is a very high spatial and ecological turnover in the grass flora, indicating a high degree of niche specialization. We also find some evidence that there are both recently disturbed and natural stable grasslands: phylogenetic community assembly indicates that recently severely disturbed grasslands are phylogenetically clustered, whereas more undisturbed grasslands tend to be phylogenetically more evenly distributed. From this evidence, it is likely that grass communities existed in Madagascar long before human arrival and so were determined by climate, natural grazing and other natural factors. Humans introduced zebu cattle farming and increased fire frequency, and may have triggered an expansion of the grasslands. Grasses probably played the same role in the modification of the Malagasy environments as elsewhere in the tropics.

Over the same period, 26 species of exotic mammals established wild populations and now occupy from one to 85 bioregions. When we classified the bioregions in terms of their original species composition, the 3-group level in the dendrogram approximated the Torresian, Eyrean and Bassian subregions proposed by Spencer in 1898, while the 4-group level separated southern semiarid Eyrean bioregions, including those in south-west Australia, from the arid Eyrean bioregions. The classification dendrogram showed geographically (and statistically) discrete clustering down to the 19-group level, suggesting that all four subregions can be further divided on the basis of their mammal faunas. Variation partitioning showed 66% of the biogeographical pattern can be explained by environmental factors (related to temperature and precipitation), the spatial position of each bioregion (a third-order polynomial of latitude and longitude), the area of each bioregion, and the richness of species in each bioregion. In addition to the marked distributional changes that indigenous mammals have experienced over the last 200 years, the 49% of variation explainable by temperature and precipitation implies further shifts with global climate change.","0004-959X

",,,,"It is increasingly recognized that ecosystems are not closed systems and that exchanges of resources across ecosystem boundaries can have repercussions on food webs, especially in low productivity systems such as the terrestrial Arctic. However, because these exchanges can take multiple forms, assessing their significance in the functioning of the tundra food web is difficult. In this paper, we first review some important concepts related to resource exchanges between ecosystems and examine their relevance to the study of trophic interactions in the arctic tundra. An analysis of the Bylot Island food web in the Canadian Arctic using a mass-balance trophic model suggests that predators are the dominant force controlling this food web. However, an important feature of this ecosystem is that several top predators benefit from allochthonous inputs, either through the presence of migratory birds during the summer or the use of the marine environment as a foraging ground in winter. We also show that migratory birds may act as autochthonous resource exporters for lower trophic levels, for instance by removing nitrogen from the nutrient pool when young produced locally migrate south and die away from the system. Although these resource exchanges may be a general feature of several arctic terrestrial ecosystems, their importance in the functioning of the tundra food web remains to be determined. Through long-term monitoring, we found that primary production in wetlands of Bylot Island increased by 85% over a 20-y period, likely a consequence of the warming trend observed in the area. However, we have not detected any changes at higher trophic levels, which is consistent with a top-down control of this food web. Given the importance of resource exchanges between ecosystems in the dynamics of the tundra food web, a full investigation of the effects of climate change will require a broader cross-ecosystem perspective.","1195-6860

",,,,"There is widespread interest in biofuel crops as a solution to the world's energy needs, particularly in light of concerns over greenhouse-gas emissions. Despite reservations about their adverse environmental impacts, no attempt has been made to quantify actual, relative or potential invasiveness of terrestrial biofuel crops at an appropriate regional or international scale, and their planting continues to be largely unregulated.Using a widely accepted weed risk assessment system, we analyzed a comprehensive list of regionally suitable biofuel crops to show that seventy percent have a high risk of becoming invasive versus one-quarter of non-biofuel plant species and are two to four times more likely to establish wild populations locally or be invasive in Hawaii or in other locations with a similar climate.Because of climatic and ecological similarities, predictions of biofuel crop invasiveness in Hawaii are applicable to other vulnerable island and subtropical ecosystems worldwide. We demonstrate the utility of an accessible and scientifically proven risk assessment protocol that allows users to predict if introduced species will become invasive in their region of interest. Other evidence supports the contention that propagule pressure created by extensive plantings will exacerbate invasions, a scenario expected with large-scale biofuel crop cultivation. Proactive measures, such as risk assessments, should be employed to predict invasion risks, which could then be mitigated via implementation of appropriate planting policies and adoption of the ""polluter-pays"" principle.

",,,,"Removing invasive rats from islands is a powerful conservation tool, and practitioners are now targeting larger islands for rat eradication. As they do so, they face the challenge of mitigating for potential non-target impacts on native biodiversity that may be susceptible to rodenticides. We report on the eradication of black rats Rattus rattus from Anacapa Island, California, in 2001–2002, which was the first-ever invasive rodent eradication from an entire island where an endemic rodent was present and the first aerial application of a rodenticide in North America. As a mitigation strategy we staggered the rodenticide application over 2 years and held a representative sample of the Anacapa deer mouse Peromyscus maniculatus anacapae in captivity. We also mitigated for bird species potentially susceptible to brodifacoum poisoning and monitored aspects of the terrestrial and marine environments. The free-ranging native rodent population severely declined following rodenticide applications but reintroduction and translocation efforts were successful, and the population quickly recovered to pre-eradication levels. Non-target impacts also included mortality of raptors, gulls and passerines, including high mortality of rufous-crowned sparrows Aimophila ruficeps obscura despite planned mitigation. All observed non-target impacts are expected to be ephemeral; however, further monitoring should reveal details on the dynamics of those impacts. Brodifacoum was not detected in the marine environment or in significant amounts in terrestrial soil, plants and arthropods. Seabird benefits from the rat eradication were quickly realized.

This is a unique resource for fundamental research in systematics, biodiversity, education and conservation management. The ABP was based on a regional species database (ATLANTIS), comprised of grid-based spatial incidence information for c. 5000 species. Most of the data rely on a comprehensive literature survey (dating back to the 19th century) as well as unpublished records from recent field surveys in the Azores. The ABP disseminates the ATLANTIS database to the public, allowing universal, unrestricted access to much of its data. Complementarily, the ABP includes additional information of interest to the general public (e.g. literature on Macaronesian biodiversity) together with images from collections and/or live specimens for many species.

",,"Wiley
",,,,"A unified understanding of the relationship between disturbance and biodiversity is needed to predict biotic responses to global change. Recent advances have identified the need to deconstruct traditional models of disturbance into intensity and frequency to reconcile empirical studies that appear to generate contradictory associations between species diversity and disturbance. We integrate results from theoretical simulation modelling, field‐based surveys of 5176 vegetation plots from 48 transects across 6 sites, and experimental pot‐based manipulations of flooding to identify how disturbance drives species diversity within ephemeral wetlands in South Island, New Zealand. We find empirical, hump‐shaped and positive relationships between species diversity and both disturbance intensity and frequency, mirroring patterns from a simulation model in which species differed in their demographic responses to disturbance. More generally, our simulations show that the relationships between diversity and disturbance shift from positive to hump‐shaped to negative as species that are favored at low disturbance because of their resistance strategies, defined by low mortality and recruitment, decline within communities relative to resilient species. Resilient species with higher mortality and recruitment rates are instead favored as disturbance intensity and frequency intensify. Our theoretical findings suggest that sites must also have a third group of unique species with intermediate resilience and resistance. Analyses of community composition along our disturbance gradients support this prediction, emphasizing that shifts in community‐level resistance and resilience drive empirical associations between diversity and disturbance. Overall, terrestrial plants may be unable to resist intense and frequent flooding, even with specialized traits. Only fast‐growing species with high regeneration from seed may respond once flooding subsides and dominate community composition in these situations, especially on nutrient‐rich soils. However, different strategies can co‐occur at intermediate disturbance, ultimately increasing species richness. As disturbances become more pervasive globally, our results suggest that differences in the niches of species, rather than demographic stochasticity, drive biodiversity patterns. These niche‐based processes may especially prevail, without accompanying losses in species richness, where sites are initially dominated by resistant taxa or life history strategies that balance resistance and resilience.

Even small abiotic shifts, associated with climate change, are likely to have pronounced impacts on these communities that currently exist at their physiological limit of survival. Changes to moisture availability, due to precipitation shifts or alterations to permanent snow reserves, will most likely cause greatest impact. In order to establish a baseline for determining the effect of climate change on continental Antarctic terrestrial communities and to better understand bryophyte species distributions in relation to moisture in a floristically important Antarctic region, this study surveyed finescale bryophyte patterns and turf water and nutrient contents along community gradients in the Windmill Islands, East Antarctica. The survey found that the Antarctic endemic, Schistidium antarctici, dominated the wettest habitats, Bryum pseudotriquetrum distribution spanned the gradient, whilst Ceratodon purpureus and Cephaloziella varians were restricted to the driest habitats. These patterns, along with knowledge of these species relative physiology, suggest the endemic Schistidium antarctici will be negatively impacted under a drying trend. This study provides a model for quantitative finescale analysis of bryophyte distributions in cryptogamic communities and forms an important reference site for monitoring impacts of climate change in Antarctica.","1488-8386

On Quail Island, Pine, Macrocarpa, Oak and Beech discs were compared. Beech discs had significantly fewer invertebrates and recognizable taxonomic units than other disc types. Pine discs had significantly more flatworms than the other three disc types. A comparison of invertebrate numbers when discs were placed directly on soil or grass indicated that larger numbers of individuals and recognizable taxonomic units were found under discs placed on bare soil compared with those on grass. Discs with a soil cavity beneath had significantly fewer individuals and recognizable taxonomic units than discs without cavities. Carabids showed considerable seasonal variation, with highest numbers in spring and lowest in winter, and larger numbers were found under discs at moist sites. Skinks over-wintered under discs in drier open sites at Lincoln and Quail Island. Disc condition was assessed after 28 months and showed Macrocarpa had deteriorated the most of the four disc types.

We compiled an inventory of invertebrate biodiversity along an elevation gradient on the temperate forested island of Hauturu, New Zealand, by DNA barcoding of specimens obtained from leaf litter samples and pitfall traps. We compared the barcodes and biodiversity estimates from this data set with those from a parallel DNA metabarcoding analysis of soil from the same locations, and with pre‐existing sequences in reference databases, before exploring the use of combined data sets as a basis for estimating total invertebrate biodiversity. We obtained 1,282 28S and 1,610 COI barcodes from a total of 1,947 invertebrate specimens, which were clustered into 247 (28S) and 366 (COI) OTUs, of which ≤ 10% were represented in GenBank. Coleoptera were most abundant (730 sequenced specimens), followed by Hymenoptera, Diptera, Lepidoptera, and Amphipoda. The most abundant OTU from both the 28S (153 sequences) and COI (140 sequences) data sets was an undescribed beetle from the family Salpingidae. Based on the occurrences of COI OTUs along the elevation gradient, we estimated there are ~1,000 arthropod species (excluding mites) on Hauturu, including 770 insects, of which 344 are beetles. A DNA metabarcoding analysis of soil DNA from the same sites resulted in the identification of similar numbers of OTUs in most invertebrate groups compared with the DNA barcoding, but less than 10% of the DNA barcoding COI OTUs were also detected by the metabarcoding analysis of soil DNA. A mark–recapture analysis based on the overlap between these data sets estimated the presence of approximately 6,800 arthropod species (excluding mites) on the island, including ~3,900 insects. Estimates of New Zealand‐wide biodiversity for selected arthropod groups based on matching of the COI DNA barcodes with pre‐existing reference sequences suggested over 13,200 insect species are present, including 4,000 Coleoptera, 2,200 Diptera, and 2,700 Hymenoptera species, and 1,000 arachnid species (excluding mites). These results confirm that metabarcoding analyses of soil DNA tends to recover different components of terrestrial invertebrate biodiversity compared to traditional invertebrate sampling, but the combined methods provide a novel basis for estimating invertebrate biodiversity.

During 3 growing seasons, we investigated the effect of experimental warming on the diversity and abundance of coastal plant communities in the Maritime Antarctic region (cryptogams only) and the Falkland Islands (vascular plants only). We compared communities from the Falkland Islands (51°S, mean annual temperature 7.9°C), with those of Signy Island (60°S, -2.1°C) and Anchorage Island (67°S, -2.6°C), and experimental temperature manipulations at each of the three islands using Open Top Chambers (OTCs). Despite the strong difference in plant growth form dominance between the Falkland Islands and the Maritime Antarctic, communities across the gradient did not differ in total diversity and species number. During the summer months, the experimental temperature increase at 5 cm height in the vegetation was similar between the locations (0.7°C across the study). In general, the response to this experimental warming was low. Total lichen cover showed a non-significant decreasing trend at Signy Island (p < 0.06). In the grass community at the Falkland Islands total vegetation cover decreased more in the OTCs than in adjacent control plots, and two species disappeared within the OTCs after only two years. This was most likely a combined consequence of a previous dry summer and the increase in temperature caused by the OTCs. These results suggest that small temperature increases may rapidly lead to decreased soil moisture, resulting in more stressful conditions for plants. The more open plant communities (grass and lichen) appeared more negatively affected by such changes than dense communities (dwarf shrub and moss).

Kiore (Rattus exulans) was the first of four rodent species introduced by people. A project to eradicate invasive rats from Kapiti Island in 1996, represented a turning point in the technology, complexity and scale at which managers of natural heritage on New Zealand islands could operate. This paper includes case studies of some significant projects targeting rodents, sometimes with other introduced mammals, undertaken in the 12 years following Kapiti. Details of the methods, costs, results and outcomes are provided for Kapiti, Whenua Hou, Tuhua, Campbell, Raoul, Hauturu, Taukihepa, and Pomona islands, collectively representing a total of over 23,000 ha of habitat cleared of introduced mammals. Research and trials undertaken in the Kapiti project provided the basis for future environmental risk assessments, allowing other projects to focus on knowledge gaps. New trends in invasive species eradication in New Zealand include more challenging multi-species eradication projects, some of which are undertaken by self- funded community groups. To summarise the lessons of the New Zealand experience: a programmatic approach is recommended which will fit each eradication within a context or framework of goals for those islands; address biosecurity issues at the outset; build capability to attempt the most challenging and rewarding projects; facilitate investment in monitoring and manage expectations of stakeholders to ensure their ongoing support. Success breeds success but is never guaranteed.

",,,,"Terrestrial species on islands often show reduced dispersal abilities. For insects, the generality of explanations for island flight loss remains contentious. Although habitat stability is considered the most plausible explanation, others are frequently highlighted. Adopting a strong inference approach, we examined the hypotheses proposed to account for the prevalence of flightlessness in island insect assemblages, for a region long suspected to be globally unusual in this regard—the Southern Ocean Islands (SOIs). Combining comprehensive faunal inventories, species' morphological information, and environmental variables from 28 SOIs, we provide the first quantitative evidence that flightlessness is exceptionally prevalent among indigenous SOI insect species (47%). Prevalence among species which have evolved elsewhere is much lower: Arctic island species (8%), species introduced to the SOIs (17%), and globally (estimated as approx. 5%). Variation in numbers of flightless species and genera across islands is best explained by variation in wind speed, although habitat stability (thermal seasonality proxy) may play a role. Variables associated with insularity, such as island size, are generally poor predictors of flightlessness. The outcomes redirect attention to Darwin's wind hypothesis. They suggest, however, that wind selects for flightlessness through an energy trade-off between flight and reproduction, instead of by displacement from suitable habitats.

",,,,"Abstract Aim By establishing a prehistoric fossil record for the vertebrate fauna of Guam, we can document the composition of the island’s fauna prior to Western contact. It will also complement the extensive prehistoric fossil data already known from the nearby islands of Rota, Tinian and Aguiguan, and improve our understanding of natural distributional patterns through a chronologically deeper view of the biogeography of the Mariana Islands. Location Northern Guam, Mariana Islands, Micronesia. Methods Fossil‐bearing sediment was removed from karst features with vertically and horizontally controlled excavation methods. Age determinations of the fossils were estimated by radiocarbon dating associated wood charcoal samples. Results The 3314 bones (fossils) of terrestrial vertebrates date to the past two millennia and represent 34 species. Among 12 species of squamate reptiles, one is extinct (a gekkonid lizard) and another, the monitor lizard, Varanus indicus , was introduced to Guam no later than about 1600 years ago. The 17 species of birds feature five that are extinct. Two others not recorded previously on Guam are extirpated. Eight others were lost on Guam in historic times. We also recovered bones of two species of indigenous bats, ( Pteropus sp., extirpated; Emballonura semicaudata , probably extirpated), and non‐native rodents, ( Rattus spp.). Main conclusions Guam’s contemporary faunal losses have been well documented since invasion of the Brown Treesnake ( Boiga irregularis ) during or shortly after WWII. Other exotics, as well as habitat deterioration, have abetted this snake’s deleterious presence. Our data further show that human impact led to declines or losses of vertebrate populations by late prehistoric times. Numerous anthropogenic extirpations would not be evident without studying fossils. Our chrono‐stratigraphic evidence argues for the arrival of non‐native rats ( Rattus sp.) only about 1000 years ago, which helps to explain why a flightless rail survived on Guam into modern times, unlike on most other islands in Oceania.

We analysed the polymerase chain reaction–restriction fragment length polymorphism of five chloroplast DNA fragments obtained from 344 individuals of A. digitata collected from 74 populations covering the entire extant distribution range of the species. Our goal was to reconstruct the phylogeographical history of the species and, if possible, to identify its centre of origin, which has been a subject of controversy for many decades. We identified five haplotypes whose distribution is clearly geographically structured. Using several species of Adansonia and of closely related genera as outgroups, the haplotypes showed a clear phylogeographical pattern of three groups. Two are phylogenetically related to the outgroup taxa, and are distributed in West Africa. The third group is substantially more differentiated genetically from outgroup species, and it corresponds to southern and eastern Africa, Arabia and the Indian Ocean islands, including Madagascar. According to our results, the tetraploid A. digitata, or its diploid progenitor, probably originated in West Africa and migrated subsequently throughout the tropical parts of that continent, and beyond, by natural and human-mediated terrestrial and overseas dispersal.","0962-1083

Here, we focus on the historical ecology and biogeography of domestic dogs (Canis familiaris) on California's Channel Islands during the Holocene. Dogs are the only animal known unequivocally to have been introduced by Native Americans to the islands, but relatively little is known about their distribution, antiquity or influence on native island fauna and flora. We identified a minimum of 96 dogs from 42 archaeological sites on six of the eight islands. Dogs were present for at least 6000 years and appear to have increased in abundance through time. Our analysis suggests that dogs, along with humans and island foxes (Urocyon littoralis), would have had an impact on native animals and ecosystems, especially breeding birds and marine mammals. Dogs and island foxes likely competed with one another for food, however, and the impacts of dogs on island ecosystems may have been reduced by the presence of island foxes and the symbiotic relationship between dogs and humans. Dogs have been removed from all but one of the islands today, eliminating one of the few terrestrial carnivores present for most of the Holocene.","0959-6836

",,"Wiley
",,,,"Aim
Some species reach extraordinary densities on islands. Island assemblages have fewer species, however, and it is possible that island species differ from their mainland counterparts in average mass. Island assemblages could be partitioned differently (fewer species or smaller individuals) from mainland sites without differing in aggregate biomass (density compensation). Our objective was to determine the generality of excess density compensation in island herpetofaunal assemblages.

Location
Our bounded removal plot data were obtained from Pacific Island sites (Guam, Saipan and Rota), the West Indies (British Virgin Islands), and the Indian Ocean (Ile aux Aigrettes off Mauritius). The literature values were taken from several locales. Other island locations included Barro Colorado Island, Bonaire, Borneo, Philippine Islands, Seychelle Islands, Barrow Island (Australia), North Brother Island (New Zealand), Dominica and Puerto Rico. Mainland sites included Costa Rica, Ivory Coast, Cameroon, Australia, Thailand, Peru, Brazil, Panama and the USA.

Method
We added our thirty-nine bounded total removal plots from sixteen island habitats to fifteen literature records to obtain seventy-five venues with estimable density and biomass of arboreal or terrestrial herpetofaunal assemblages. These biomass estimates were evaluated geographically and in relation to sampling method, insularity, latitude, disturbance regime, seasonality, community richness, vegetative structure and climate. Direct data on trophic interactions (food availability, parasitism and predation pressure) were generally unavailable. Sampling problems were frequent for arboreal, cryptic and evasive species.

Results and main conclusions
We found strong evidence that herpetofaunal assemblages on small islands (mostly lizards) exhibit a much greater aggregate density of biomass (kg ha−1) than those of larger islands or mainland assemblages (small islands show excess density compensation). High aggregate biomass density was more strongly associated with the degree of species impoverishment on islands than it was on island area or insularity per se. High aggregate biomass density was not strongly associated with latitude, precipitation, canopy height or a variety of other physical characteristics of the study sites. The association between high aggregate biomass density and species-poor islands is consistent with the effects of a reduced suite of predators on depauperate islands, but other features may also contribute to excess density compensation.","0305-0270

",,,,"Tropical fire ant (TFA), Solenopsis geminata (Fabricius, 1804), is considered as one of the most serious threats to the terrestrial fauna of Galápagos, yet little is known about its distribution and impact in the archipelago. We reviewed literature, studied museum specimens and sampled over 62 sites on ten islands and islets in order to update the distribution of TFA. Since the 1980's, species occurrences for TFA have increased from three to 115 localities, and the species is now recorded on seven islands and 11 islets. Sixty-six new records were registered since the last review in 2008, including the islets Bayas, Champion, Cuevas, and Eden. TFA seems to be present in a wide range of habitats with a clear predominance in human-disturbed zones. Our data, compiled with previous studies, suggest that TFA can behaviorally dominate other ants. TFA was collected on 28 nesting sites of endangered and/or endemic vertebrate species, where it constitutes a potential or proven threat. This study identifies potential invasion sites as well as endemic species that may further be impacted by this highly invasive ant. It also recommends regular monitoring to prevent further invasion.

Adults in two exposed breeding ponds preferred deep, vegetated areas. In a heavily shaded pond, the males segregated from the females and preferred nonvegetated areas, and in a pond with bluegills, the adults preferred shallow zones. On land, most resident salamanders remained close to a breeding pond that was immediately surrounded by a steep bank and woods, whereas few stayed close to exposed ponds with little ground cover. Salamanders were facultative emigrators, making major emigratory movements during spring, fall, or both, or not migrating at all. Two displaced salamanders showed normal pond activity but atypical terrestrial movements. Frequent predation occurred in small-mammal runways, most likely by short-tailed shrews. Salamanders excavated tunnels for temporary refuge but used small-mammal runway systems for long-term refuge. These new observations for A. tigrinum show adaptability in movements and habitat use during breeding and emigration consistent with the species' wide distribution in eastern North America.","0045-8511

",,,,"The Antarctic terrestrial environment is under increasing pressure from human activities. The Fildes Region is characterized by high biodiversity, but is also a major logistic centre for the northern Antarctic Peninsula. Different interests, from scientific research, nature conservation, protection of geological and historical values, station operations, transport logistics and tourism, regularly overlap in space and time. This has led to increasing conflict among the multiple uses of the region and breaches of the legal requirements for environmental protection that apply in the area. The aim of this study was to assess the impacts of human activities in the Fildes Region by monitoring the distribution of bird and seal breeding sites and recording human activities and their associated environmental impacts. Data from an initial monitoring period 200306 were compared with data from 200810. We observed similar or increased levels of air, land and ship traffic, but fewer violations of overflight limits near Antarctic Specially Protected Area No. 150 Ardley Island. Open waste dumping and oil contamination are still major environmental impacts. Scientific and outdoor leisure activities undertaken by station personnel are more frequent than tourist activities and are likely to have a commensurate level of environmental impact. Despite the initial success of some existing management measures, it is essential that scientific and environmental values continue to be safeguarded, otherwise environmental impacts will increase and the habitat will be further degraded. We argue that the Fildes Region should be considered for designation as an Antarctic Specially Managed Area, a measure that has proven effective for environmental management of vulnerable areas of the Antarctic.Keywords: human impact; Antarctic; Fildes Region; environmental management; Antarctic Specially Managed Area; protected area(Published: 18 May 2012)Citation: Polar Research 2012, 31, 18206, http://dx.doi.org/10.3402/polar.v31i0.18206

",,,,"Palmyra Atoll, in the Line Islands of the equatorial Pacific, supports one of the largest remaining native stands of Pisonia grandis forest in the tropical Pacific Ocean. In 2003, we surveyed terrestrial arthropods to document extant native and introduced species richness, compare these lists with historical records, and assess potential threats to native species and ecosystem integrity. In total, 115 arthropod taxa were collected, bringing the total number of taxa recorded since 1913 to 162. Few native species were collected; most taxa were accidental introductions also recorded from the Hawaiian Islands, the presumed main source of introductions to Palmyra. The overlap with previous historical surveys in 1913 and 1948 was low (<40%), and new species continue to establish, with one species of whitefly reaching pest status between 2003 and 2005. We observed numerous dead or dying large Pisonia grandis, and the green scale Pulvinaria urbicola (Coccidae) was particularly abundant on trees of poor health. Abundant introduced ants, particularly Pheidole megacephala, tended this and other hemipterans feeding on both native and introduced plants. We hypothesize that the Pheidole-Pulvinaria facultative mutualism is causing the decline of Pisonia grandis. Because of the unique properties of Pisonia grandis forest on oceanic atolls, its importance for nesting seabirds, and its alarming global decline, immediate conservation efforts should be directed at controlling introduced Hemiptera and disrupting their mutualisms with nonnative ants on Palmyra Atoll.

",,"Wiley
",,,,"The New Zealand flatworm Arthurdendyus triangulatus (=Artioposthia triangulata) is an example of an invasive organism that, by reducing lumbricid earthworm populations, could have a major impact on soil ecosystems in Britain and the Faroe Islands. How it was introduced into the British Isles is not known, but like many invasive species, it is suspected that it was introduced by humans and was associated with the trade between New Zealand and Britain. Once established in Britain it found in the large, readily available earthworm population a niche that it could exploit. The microclimate of the forests in the center and south of the South Island of New Zealand from whence the flatworm came is similar to that in parts of the British Isles and consequently conducive to its survival. Although when compared with many other invertebrate introductions (e.g., insects) the flatworm's rate of increase has been slow, a retrospective study strongly suggested that, in Scotland, they spread from botanic gardens to horticultural wholesalers, then to domestic gardens, and only latterly did they invade agricultural land. As with other invasive species, the application of the CLIMEX computer model and geographic-information-system techniques have been used to try to ascertain its potential distribution within both the British Isles and Europe. The data suggest that A. triangulatus could become established in northwest continental Europe, and Denmark, Iceland, and Sweden have added it to their quarantine pest lists. The fact that A. triangulatus is the only one of 12 alien terrestrial planarians in Britain to be considered a pest suggests that this group of invertebrates is behaving in a fashion similar to other invasive organisms and obeys the “tens rule” suggested by M. Williamson. Since within the period 1995–1997 another three species of predatory terrestrial planarians have been recorded in Scotland it is evident that the existing phytosanitary regulations must be more strongly enforced or new ones introduced if the spread of terrestrial planarians is to be halted.","1051-0761

",,,,"The impacts of glacial cycles on the geographical distribution and size of populations have been explored for numerous terrestrial and marine taxa. However, most studies have focused on high latitudes, with only a few focused on the response of biota to the last glacial maximum (LGM) in equatorial regions. Here, we examine how population sizes of key bee fauna in the southwest Pacific archipelagos of Fiji, Vanuatu and Samoa have fluctuated over the Quaternary. We show that all three island faunas suffered massive population declines, roughly corresponding in time to the LGM, followed by rapid expansion post-LGM. Our data therefore suggest that Pleistocene climate change has had major impacts across a very broad tropical region. While other studies indicate widespread Holarctic effects of the LGM, our data suggest a much wider range of latitudes, extending to the tropics, where these climate change repercussions were important. As key pollinators, the inferred changes in these bee faunas may have been critical in the development of the diverse Pacific island flora. The magnitude of these responses indicates future climate change scenarios may have alarming consequences for Pacific island systems involving pollinator-dependent plant communities and agricultural crops.

",,,,"Post-fire salvage logging (SL) is a common management action that involves the harvesting of burnt trees. As a consequence, a large amount of biological legacies in the form of logs and other coarse woody debris are removed from the post-fire habitat, creating a more simplified landscape. Therefore, SL could act as an additional disturbance over that produced by fire. In this study, we seek to determine the effect of SL on the regeneration of the bryophyte community of a laurel forest from the Canary Islands (Spain). We hypothesized that SL will act as an additional disturbance and, consequently, salvaged areas will have a higher difference in community composition with respect to a reference ecosystem (RE). Mosses and liverworts were sampled 22 months after the salvage operations in salvaged plots, non-salvaged, and in an RE represented by areas of the original forest. Species richness did not differ between salvage and non-salvaged treatments. However, multivariate analysis and species-indicator analysis showed that non-salvaged plots had a composition closer to that of the RE, with a higher proportion of closed-canopy, perennial, and long-lived species, as well as some epiphytes. By contrast, salvaged plots were dominated by early-successional terrestrial species and species preferring open habitats. We conclude that post-fire SL represents an additional disturbance that further delays succession, a result that is consistent with previous studies using other taxonomic groups. SL should therefore be avoided or, if implemented, the possibility of leaving part of the post-fire biological legacies in situ should be considered.

Of the five non‐native invertebrate species currently in terrestrial Antarctica, the flightless midge Eretmoptera murphyi (Schaeffer, The Museum of the Brooklyn Institute of Arts and Sciences 2:90–94, 1914) is perhaps the most persistent insect invader. Accidentally introduced to Signy Island (60°S) in the 1960s from sub‐Antarctic South Georgia (54°S), E. murphyi has steadily increased its distribution, however, its status has not been reassessed for a decade. Here, we update the distribution of E. murphyi on Signy, specifically assessing whether footpaths to regularly visited research sites represent dispersal corridors. Our findings show that both the abundance and range of E. murphyi have increased significantly since 2009, particularly along paths leading away from the original introduction site, and that the species is now on the cusp of moving into new valley systems. We identify a moderate association with soil/substrate and vegetation types and build Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt) models to predict areas of the island that may be at highest risk of future colonisation. As a detritivore with no competitors or predators, E. murphyi may have a major impact. For example, accelerating nutrient cycling which may have wider impacts on all levels of biodiversity. This study highlights the need for an assessment of current biosecurity protocols applied within the Antarctic Treaty system, as well as the need for systematic regular monitoring of introduced and invasive species in Antarctica.

Comprehensive knowledge of the fundamental spatial ecology of marine species is critical to allow the identification of key habitats and the likely sources of anthropogenic threats, thus informing effective conservation strategies. 2. Research on migratory marine vertebrates has lagged behind many similar terrestrial animal groups, but studies using electronic tagging systems and molecular techniques offer great insights. 3. Marine turtles have complex life history patterns, spanning wide spatio‐temporal scales. As a result of this multidimensional complexity, and despite extensive effort, there are no populations for which a truly holistic understanding of the spatial aspects of the life history has been attained. There is a particular lack of information regarding the distribution and habitats utilized during the first few years of life. 4. We used satellite tracking technology to track individual turtles following nesting at the green turtle Chelonia mydas nesting colony at Poilão Island, Guinea Bissau; the largest breeding aggregation in the eastern Atlantic. 5. We further contextualize these data with pan‐Atlantic molecular data and oceanographic current modelling to gain insights into likely dispersal patterns of hatchlings and small pelagic juveniles. 6. All adult turtles remained in the waters of West Africa, with strong connectivity demonstrated with Banc D’Arguin, Mauritania. 7. Despite shortcomings in current molecular markers, we demonstrate evidence for profound sub‐structuring of marine turtle stocks across the Atlantic; with a high likelihood based on oceanographic modelling that most turtles from Guinea‐Bissau are found in the eastern Atlantic. 8. Synthesis and applications. There is an increased need for a better understanding of spatial distribution of marine vertebrates demonstrating life histories with spatio‐temporal complexity. We propose the synergistic use of the technologies and modelling used here as a working framework for the future rapid elucidation of the range and likely key habitats used by the different life stages from such species.

",,,,"• Premise of the study: Hawaii is home to 238 native and 35 alien fern and lycophyte taxa distributed across steep gradients in elevation and resource availability. The fern flora spans a wide range of growth forms, with extraordinary diversity in morphology and plant size. Yet the potential factors underlying this diversity have remained enigmatic.

• Methods: We used a trait database generated from the most recent and comprehensive survey of Hawaiian ferns and lycophytes to test hypotheses of size-scaling and trait associations with environment and growth form as factors underlying this diversity. We also tested relationships among morphology, taxon abundance and distribution and identified key differences between native and alien taxa.

• Key results: Strong trait–trait relationships included geometric scaling of plant dimensions with a tendency for more divided fronds in larger ferns. Trait–environment relationships independent of size included more divided fronds at higher elevation, longer blades in shaded habitats, and fronds with shorter stipes and fewer pinnae in drier habitats. Growth forms differed in mean size with epiphytic and epipetric taxa smaller than terrestrial ferns. Plant size was independent of taxon abundance and distribution across islands, and native and alien ferns did not differ in mean size. Alien taxa were more abundant, especially at lower elevations, apparently due to human land use.

• Conclusions: These relationships point to linkages of fern form and demography with biogeography and highlight potential flora-scale physiological and morphological adaptations in ferns across contrasting environments.","0002-9122

",,,,"As part of the International Kuril Island Project, we collected data on the distribution patterns of native terrestrial, non‐volant mammals inhabiting the Kuril archipelago in the northwest Pacific. The Kurils have a complex physical geography, featuring both landbridge and oceanic islands in which small mammal‐occupied islands are near mainlands, whereas larger islands are more isolated. This geography, in combination with the Kurils’ cold climate, causes the mammalian fauna to deviate from traditional island biogeographic patterns. We examined these patterns and the mechanisms influencing them using both nestedness analyses and measures of compositional disharmony. We found, as island isolation increases, carnivores constitute an increasing fraction of the mammalian fauna. We suggest that this intriguing pattern of carnivore dominance occurs because species’ dispersal abilities increase with increasing body size in the Kurils’ cold climate. Substantial energy reserves and cold tolerance of large‐bodied carnivores may have been a major factor in determining mam‐ malian colonization patterns, patterns which are perhaps indicative of the complex manners in which challenging climates impact mammalian community assemblages.

",,,,"Abstract Aim Large‐scale biodiversity patterns are often discussed in the context of ‘out of the tropics’ (OTT) dynamics and/or tropical niche conservatism (TNC), but empirical evidence of these processes remains very limited. The aim of this study was to infer diversification processes and mechanisms of Cenozoic diversity dynamics using woody angiosperms. Location East Asian continental islands and global. Time period Cenozoic. Major taxa studied Woody plants. Methods We compiled Cenozoic fossil and modern records for woody angiosperm genera to reconstruct biodiversity patterns. To evaluate the relative importance of TNC and OTT, we investigated extinction/survival patterns and latitudinal range dynamics for each genus, in combination with their clade age (mean family age), cold tolerance and per‐genus species richness. Results We found diversity decreasing with latitude in modern‐day flora, but not in the warmer periods of the Neogene and Palaeogene. The percentage of genera surviving decreased with latitude through the Cenozoic. Older genera with less cold tolerance and/or species‐poor genera went extinct locally at high latitudes in response to post‐Pliocene global cooling. Evolutionarily younger temperate genera dispersed from the extratropics to lower latitudes and the Southern Hemisphere after the Neogene. Main conclusions The latitudinal diversity gradient (LDG) has rapidly steepened post‐Pliocene through: (a) selective extinction in higher latitudes of old, less‐diversified tropical genera with low freezing tolerance, and (b) equatorward distributional shift of temperate genera. Both these processes were driven by the high‐latitude cooling. Such major roles of TNC and OTT, wherein temperate genera in the Northern Hemisphere expanded through the tropics into higher latitudes of the Southern Hemisphere across climatic boundaries without losing their temperate presence, are in contrast to OTT processes in marine systems. Cenozoic patterns of terrestrial woody angiosperm biodiversity indicate the importance of TNC and high‐latitude processes, including the extinction of tropical genera and range contraction or shift of temperate genera.

",,"Wiley
",,,,"Aim
To examine and compare patterns of species richness and prominence across the Australian continent for taxonomic and ecological subsets of the granivorous bird fauna.

Location
The Australian continental mainland and island of Tasmania.

Methods
Bird species records from the Atlas of Australian Birds (Blakers et al., 1984) were arranged in degree cells and analysed as raw tallies of species richness, and as averaged proportions of the recorded land bird assemblage.

Results
There were striking differences in the geographical distribution of absolute and relative abundance of foraging and taxonomic classes of granivorous birds. Granivorous birds that forage in trees are confined to the parrots and cockatoos (Psittaciformes), are most speciose in areas dominated by evergreen forests or woodlands and are equally species-poor in the arid-zone and the monsoonal tropics. In contrast, obligate terrestrial foragers are morphologically diverse and occur in all the families considered (Phasianidae, Turnicidae, Pedionomidae, Columbidae, Cacatuidae, Psittacidae, Passeridae). They are most speciose over a broad area of eastern, south-eastern and north-western Australia. Among obligate terrestrial foragers there is a marked latitudinal sequence of replacement of granivore taxa: finches (Passeridae) are most prominent in the monsoonal savannas, pigeons (Columbidae) are most prominent in the semiarid tropics, and parrots (Cacatuidae and Psittacidae) in the winter-rainfall arid and semiarid zones.

Main conclusions
These striking patterns may be related to differences in the size, bill shape and heat tolerance of the taxa, and to the history of evolution and/or colonization of the taxonomic group within Australia.","0305-0270

",,,,"Abstract Little is known about the aerial transport of microbes, plants and animals into and between Antarctic terrestrial and freshwater habitats. Isolation by the circumpolar Southern Ocean restricts propagules to three main groups: 1) those capable of prolonged survival in the air, 2) those carried by animal vectors, especially Man, and 3) those of marine origin. Diverse ice-free areas available for colonization include: isolated islands with receding ice sheets (e.g., Signy Island), maritime geothermal areas (e.g., Deception Island), and high altitude gcothermal areas on continental volcanoes (e.g., Mt. Erebus). Propagule abundance and diversity are low in Antarctica. Chance affects colonization success because the potential and viability of a propagule must match a favourable habitat for settlement, with adequate time for establishment before conditions become unfavourable. Aerobiological studies of the whole Antarctic region require international co-operation. The Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research (SCAR) Biological Investigations of Terrestrial Antarctic Systems (BIOTAS) research network has identified aerobiology as a major component of its International Research Programme. Aerobiology will be ground-, ship- and aircraft-based. To meet the requirements of an intrinsically sparse, diverse Antarctic aerobiota, the British Antarctic Survey is developing a new particle sampler for remote field use.

Each species illustrated marked zonation such that they formed a distinct sequence from the subtidal across the wide intertidal zone to the supra-littoral. In addition to shore height zonation, there was distinct variation in type and range of habitat preferences. Of the 5 study islands, Quirimba and Quisiva had the greatest intertidal habitat variety and the largest number of resident hermit crab species. The number of hermit crab species peaked at 10 in the lower-shore zone and decreased upshore to 3 supra-littoral species and downshore to 8 subtidal species. In contrast, the density of hermit crab individuals peaked in the upper mid-shore, at 3 m-2. The mid-shore zone was also the primary region of cluster formation, principally involving Clibanarius laevimanus and Clibanarius virescens, although 3 other species were also involved. The activity of the 2 semi-terrestrial species, Coenobita rugosus and Coenobita cavipes, on Quirimba Island was principally related to the light:dark cycle but was strikingly different between open and mangrove habitats. Some degree of activity took place in both species throughout a 24 h period in the mangrove habitat, where the peak of feeding activity was twice that of the open sand-scrub habitat. Wind strength was a major influence on the activity of C. rugosus and C. cavipes, reducing the number of active individuals to zero at higher wind speeds, even in thinly mangroved habitats.

",,,,"Despite the importance of understanding the mechanisms underlying range limits and abundance structure, few studies have sought to do so. Here we use a terrestrial slug species, Deroceras panormitanum , that has invaded a remote, largely predator-free, Southern Ocean island as a model system to do so. Across Marion Island, slug density does not conform to an abundant centre distribution. Rather, abundance structure is characterized by patches and gaps. These are associated with this desiccation-sensitive species' preference for biotic and drainage line habitats that share few characteristics except for their high humidity below the vegetation surface. The coastal range margin has a threshold form, rapidly rising from zero to high density. Slugs do not occur where soil-exchangeable Na values are higher than 3000 mg kg −1 , and in laboratory experiments, survival is high below this value but negligible above it. Upper elevation range margins are a function of the inability of this species to survive temperatures below an absolute limit of −6.4°C, which is regularly exceeded at 200 m altitude, above which slug density declines to zero. However, the linear decline in density from the coastal peak is probably also a function of a decline in performance or time available for activity. This is probably associated with an altitudinal decline in mean annual soil temperature. These findings support previous predictions made regarding the form of density change when substrate or climatic factors set range limits.

Here, we estimated the spatial and temporal patterns of C storage from 1993–2008 in Hainan's forest ecosystems by combining our measured data with four consecutive national forest inventories data. Forest coverage increased from 20.7% in the 1950s to 56.4% in the 2010s. The average C density of 163.7 Mg C/ha in Hainan's forest ecosystems in this study was slightly higher than that of China's mainland forests, but was remarkably lower than that in the tropical forests worldwide. Total forest ecosystem C storage in Hainan increased from 109.51 Tg in 1993 to 279.17 Tg in 2008. Soil C accounted for more than 70% of total forest ecosystem C. The spatial distribution of forest C storage in Hainan was uneven, reflecting differences in land use change and forest management. The potential carbon sequestration of forest ecosystems was 77.3 Tg C if all forested lands were restored to natural tropical forests. To increase the C sequestration potential on Hainan Island, future forest management should focus on the conservation of natural forests, selection of tree species, planting of understory species, and implementation of sustainable practices.

We use the long-term (up to 24 years) monitoring records available on Bylot Island in the Canadian Arctic to examine temporal trends in population attributes of several terrestrial vertebrates and in primary production. Despite a warming trend (e.g. cumulative annual thawing degree-days increased by 37% and snow-melt date advanced by 4–7 days over a 23-year period), we found little evidence for changes in the phenology, abundance or productivity of several vertebrate species (snow goose, foxes, lemmings, avian predators and one passerine). Only primary production showed a response to warming (annual above-ground biomass of wetland graminoids increased by 123% during this period). We nonetheless found evidence for potential mismatches between herbivores and their food plants in response to warming as snow geese adjusted their laying date by only 3.8 days on average for a change in snow-melt of 10 days, half of the corresponding adjustment shown by the timing of plant growth (7.1 days). We discuss several reasons (duration of time series, large annual variability, amplitude of observed climate change, nonlinear dynamic or constraints imposed by various rate of warming with latitude in migrants) to explain the lack of response by herbivores and predators to climate warming at our study site. We also show how length and intensity of monitoring could affect our ability to detect temporal trends and provide recommendations for future monitoring.

",,"Wiley
",,,,"Experience from the Antarctic indicates that the establishment of alien species may have significant negative effects on native flora and fauna in polar regions and is considered to be amongst the greatest threats to biodiversity. But, there have been few similar studies from the Arctic. Although the terrestrial invertebrate inventory of the Svalbard Archipelago is amongst the most complete for any region of the Arctic, no consideration has yet been made of alien terrestrial invertebrate species, their invasiveness tendencies, threat to the native biology or their route of entry. Such baseline information is critical for appropriate management strategies. Fifteen alien invertebrate species have established in the Svalbard environment, many of which have been introduced via imported soils. Biosecurity legislation now prohibits such activities. None of the recorded established aliens yet show invasive tendencies but some may have locally negative effects. Ten species are considered to be vagrants and a further seven are classified as observations. Vagrants and the observations are not believed to be able to establish in the current tundra environment. The high connectivity of Svalbard has facilitated natural dispersal processes and may explain why few alien species are recorded compared to isolated islands in the maritime Antarctic. The vagrant species observed are conspicuous Lepidoptera, implying that less evident vagrant species are also arriving regularly. Projected climate change may enable vagrant species to establish, with results that are difficult to foresee.Keywords: Introduced; microarthropod; enchytraeid; Acari; biodiversity.(Published: 15 September 2015)Citation: Polar Research 2015, 34, 27364, http://dx.doi.org/10.3402/polar.v34.27364To access the supplementary material for this article, please see supplementary files in the column to the right (under Article Tools).

",,,,"Hawaii is unique among the United States because of its tropical climate, geographic isolation, high rates of species endemism and discontinuous land mass. The year-round warm, wet climate on the windward sides of islands and the high fertility of relatively young volcanically derived soils are ideal conditions for carbon input, storage and carbon sequestration in ecosystems of the main Hawaiian Islands. A number of plot- and stand-level studies examining the physical and biological controls over tropical ecosystem carbon storage and flux provide evidence of the high carbon sequestration capacity of Hawaiian terrestrial ecosystems with a focus on soils, live biomass and plant productivity. However, there have been relatively few regional to island-wide studies examining the biotic and environmental controls on aboveground carbon density, and no island- to statewide estimates of carbon fluxes and net carbon balance for ecosystems of the Hawaiian Islands. The goal of this report is to provide robust baseline estimates of carbon storage and flux across the Hawaiian Islands based on the best available data, and to then use this baseline data as input to predict how carbon cycling and storage may respond to projected future changes in climate, land use, land cover and disturbance.

",,,,"The native terrestrial food web of sub-Antarctic islands is dominated by decomposers with rare herbivores and almost no predators. As a consequence of increasing human activities, the number of alien plants and invertebrates species, including phytophagous species, has been dramatically rising on these islands. These repeated introductions seem likely to have a great impact on the ecosystem functioning. This is the first detailed study on species diversity, host range and spatial distribution of aphids on French sub-Antarctic islands. Six cosmopolitan and polyphagous aphid species have been recorded on these islands. Five species have been found in the wild where they colonized native and introduced plants, and one species was confined to a glasshouse. Aphids colonized a littoral band and were limited to below 200 m a.s.l. Their spatial distribution is constrained by host plant distribution and temperature. The two dominant species, Myzus ascalonicus and Rhopalosiphum padi, are obligately parthenogenetic in these islands and have been observed to be active on plants during winter. The other species are also presumably obligate parthenogens because of the absence of host plants where sexual reproduction can occur. We suggest that polyphagy and parthenogenesis are major biological traits that influence colonization success by aphids in a sub-Antarctic environment.","0954-1020

",,,,"(1) Parallel evolution from separate marine ancestors has given rise to two groups of genera of terrestrial nemerteans, representative of at least two different family stocks. They have colonized land by the direct route, moving up the shore on widely separated oceanic islands. The relationships between the known terrestrial and semi-terrestrial nemerteans, comprising seven genera and 15 species, are defined and their geographic distribution is discussed.

(2) In fresh water, three heteronemertean and nine hoplonemertean species are known. The hoplonemerteans arise from two different families representing two different evolutionary routes to fresh water, one by way of estuaries and the other via land. The distribution of freshwater nemerteans and the characters common to all species are discussed.

(3) Very little is known about the comparative physiology of land and freshwater nemerteans. However, information about the physiology of marine forms is combined with morphological differences from them found in terrestrial and freshwater species to suggest profitable lines of future research.

(4) Water relations pose a major problem for both terrestrial and freshwater nemerteans. The role of the cerebral organs, the blood and the excretory system in the osmotic physiology of some littoral nemerteans is beginning to be understood. These systems in land and freshwater forms have clearly distinctive features which need to be thoroughly investigated.

",,,,"The Indonesian island of Sulawesi harbors a highly endemic and diverse fauna sparking fascination since long before Wallace's contemplation of biogeographical patterns in the region. Allopatric diversification driven by geological or climatic processes has been identified as the main mechanism shaping present faunal distribution on the island. There is both consensus and conflict among range patterns of terrestrial species pointing to the different effects of vicariant events on once co-distributed taxa. Tarsiers, small nocturnal primates with possible evidence of an Eocene fossil record on the Asian mainland, are at present exclusively found in insular Southeast Asia. Sulawesi is hotspot of tarsier diversity, whereby island colonization and subsequent radiation of this old endemic primate lineage remained largely enigmatic. To resolve the phylogeographic history of Sulawesi tarsiers we analyzed an island-wide sample for a set of five approved autosomal phylogenetic markers (ABCA1, ADORA3, AXIN1, RAG1, and TTR) and the paternally inherited SRY gene. We constructed ML and Bayesian phylogenetic trees and estimated divergence times between tarsier populations. We found that their arrival at the Proto-Sulawesi archipelago coincided with initial Miocene tectonic uplift and hypothesize that tarsiers dispersed over the region in distinct waves. Intra-island diversification was spurred by land emergence and a rapid succession of glacial cycles during the Plio-Pleistocene. Some tarsier range boundaries concur with spatial limits in other taxa backing the notion of centers of faunal endemism on Sulawesi. This congruence, however, has partially been superimposed by taxon-specific dispersal patterns.

",,,,"1. The distribution, movements and foraging activity of harbour and grey seals from the inner Moray Firth, N.E. Scotland, were compared using a combination of observations at haul-out sites, VHF and satellite-link telemetry, and analyses of diet composition. 2. Terrestrial abundance of both grey and harbour seals was highest during the summer but there were marked differences in the extent to which the two species moved between different haul-out sites. Harbour seals showed local seasonal changes in distribution, but all 21 radio-tagged seals moved only to alternative haul-out sites within a range of 75km. In contrast, four of the five grey seals tracked from the Moray Firth moved to haul-out sites 125-365 km away, and provided evidence of interchange between the Moray Firth and other grey seal breeding areas in Orkney, the Fifth of Forth and the Farne Islands. 3. All harbour seals foraged within 60 km of their haul-out sites, but showed seasonal variation in their foraging areas which was related to changes in their terrestrial distribution. In contrast, those grey seals which foraged within the Moray Firth travelled up to 145 km from haul-out sites. Nevertheless, there was some overlap in the foraging areas used by harbour seals and grey seals in more inshore areas. 4. Sandeels, gadoids, flatfish and cephalopods formed over 95% of the diet of both species. However, dietary data, particularly for grey seals, may be biased toward those individuals which fed in more inshore areas. 5. These results suggest that Moray Firth harbour seals can be considered as a relatively discrete population, with clear links between breeding, feeding and resting areas, and little exchange of adults between this and adjacent breeding areas in Orkney and the Tay Estuary. In contrast, grey seals from several different breeding sites appear to move into the Moray Firth in summer and use the area primarily for foraging and non-breeding haul-out.","0021-8901

","Larivière, Marie‐Claude; Fletcher, Murray; Larochelle, André",,Auchenorrhyncha,,,2010.0,,,,,,,,,,63,63,,,,,,,"Abstract
Auchenorrhyncha are a highly diverse group of hemimetabolous insects and a major component of the phytophagous insect fauna in most terrestrial ecosystems worldwide. They are treated here as a suborder of the Hemiptera and include the planthoppers (infraorder Fulgoromorpha), cicadas, froghoppers, spittlebugs, treehoppers, and leafhoppers (infraorder Cicadomorpha). With their piercing sucking mouthparts the majority of Auchenorrhyncha species feed on phloem or xylem (plant sap) or plant cell contents (parenchyma or cell ruptures) although some species feed on mosses or fungi. This economically important group includes several plant pests pests and several vectors of plant pathogens, including phytoplasmas, viruses, and bacteria.

Auchenorrhyncha have been collected extensively and are well represented in New Zealand entomological museums and collections. Despite this, no up-to-date catalogue has been published since Wise’s (1977) “ ... synonymic checklist of the Hexapoda of the New Zealand sub-region ...” which enumerated 64 genera and 160 species in 11 families. Numerous nomenclatural changes and new taxa have been published since then, and the fauna now totals 68 genera and 196 species in 12 families.

In this biosystematics catalogue, the species-group names of all New Zealand Cicadomorpha and Fulgoromorpha are catalogued with distribution records and information on biology and wing condition (as indicative of flight ability). Valid names are listed in their current and original combinations with the author(s), publication date, page citation, type status, type repository, type locality, and biostatus. Synonyms are given in their original combinations. Other existing combinations are provided. Genus-group names are listed with the author(s), publication date, page citation, type species (including method of fixation), and biostatus. The catalogue is arranged alphabetically by infraorders, superfamilies, families, subfamilies, tribes, genus-group, and species-group names. Under each species, the geographic distribution, biology, and wing condition are given. Selected references dealing with taxonomy (including keys and revisions), distribution, biology, and dispersal power are also provided where appropriate.

The catalogue also includes a bibliography of over 500 references (including original taxonomic descriptions), colour photographs of 133 primary types deposited in New Zealand collections (covering about 68% of all described taxa), 207 maps showing species and subspecies distributions, four maps showing patterns of taxonomic diversity and species endemism, and a full taxonomic index. Finally, 8 appendices are provided: glossary, list of approximately 300 plants associated with Auchenorrhyncha, acronyms of entomological collections and museums, list of taxa incorrectly recorded or doubtfully established in New Zealand, geographical coordinates of over 380 collecting localities, alphabetical lists of valid taxa by areas of New Zealand, type localities of valid species described from New Zealand, and a list of about 95 taxa with limited distribution and which are of potential conservation importance. This catalogue brings together the available literature and collection-based information on New Zealand Fulgoromorpha and Cicadomorpha for use by biosystematists, identifiers, biosecurity and conservation managers, ecologists and other biologists, as well as members of the public.

The composition of the New Zealand auchenorrhynchan fauna and its affinities with Australia, Lord Howe Island, Norfolk Island, and New Caledonia are analysed and discussed. It is estimated that, once fully described, the fauna could total 300–350 species. Endemism is high with 81% of species and 41% of genera currently recognised as being endemic; New Zealand is regarded as a biodiversity “hot spot”. The fauna shows greatest affinity to that of eastern continental Australia. Twenty-four (24) adventive (introduced) taxa occur in New Zealand, including some economically important species, e.g., Philaenus spumarius (Linnaeus, 1758), Aphrophoridae; Anzygina dumbletoni (Ghauri, 1963), Edwardsiana froggatti (Baker, 1925), Eupteryx melissae Curtis, 1837, Orosius argentatus (Evans, 1938), Ribautiana tenerrima (Herrich-Schäffer, 1834), Rhytidodus decimaquartus (Schrank, 1776), Cicadellidae; Anzora unicolor (Walker, 1862), Flatidae; Scolypopa australis (Walker, 1851), Ricaniidae.

The following new combinations are made: Arawa negata (White, 1879) for Athysanus negatus White, 1879, Nesoclutha phryne (Kirkaldy, 1907) for Nesoclutha pallida (Evans, 1942) (Cicadellidae); Cermada inexspectata (Larivière, 1999) for Cixius inexspectatus Larivière, 1999, Cermada triregia (Larivière, 1999) for Cixius triregius Larivière, 1999 (Cixiidae). Arawa salubris Knight, 1975 is synonymised with Arawa negata (White, 1879). The following Cicadellidae taxa have been incorrectly recorded or doubtfully established in New Zealand: Alodeltocephalus obliquus (Evans, 1938), Balclutha rieki Knight, 1987, Edwardsiana crataegi (Douglas, 1876), Japananus hyalinus (Osborn, 1900), Limotettix incertus Evans, 1966, Paracephaleus montanus (Evans, 1942). The cicadellid genus Athysanus Burmeister, 1838, is excluded from the fauna.

The areas of New Zealand showing the highest taxonomic diversity are: North Island – Wellington (73 species-group taxa), Auckland (64), Northland (60); South Island – Northwest Nelson (65), Mid Canterbury (56). The areas displaying the highest number of New Zealand endemics are: North Island – Wellington (63 species-group taxa), Northland (47), Taupo (46), Auckland (45), Bay of Plenty (40); South Island – Northwest Nelson (50), Buller (45), Mid Canterbury (40). The areas known for the highest number of local endemics are: North Island – Northland (5), Wellington (5); South Island – Northwest Nelson (4).

New Zealand Auchenorrhyncha are generally diurnal and live in lowland to mountain forests and shrublands, although a number of groups are found typically in open habitats such as tussock grasslands and in subalpine environments. Indigenous species usually live within the confines of their natural habitats but some species also live in modified ecosystems and exotic tree plantations. Depending on families and genera, species can be predominantly planticolous, arboreal, or even epigean. The hostplants are known with certainty for less than 20% of taxa. The taxonomy and biology of immature stages are largely unknown for the majority of taxa. Anecdotal evidence suggests that parasitic wasps, birds, predatory beetles, spiders, and mites may be among the major natural enemies of New Zealand Auchenorrhyncha. Overall, about 25% of the fauna is either brachypterous or micropterous. Active dispersal by flight is unlikely for the majority of New Zealand species.",,,,,,"https://doi.org/10.7931/j2/fnz.63

",,,,"Abstract House mice ( Mus musculus ) are a widespread invasive species on islands. Where they are the sole introduced mammal they can have particularly strong negative impacts on recipient ecosystems. House mice impacts have been documented on almost every component of the terrestrial ecosystem on Southern Ocean islands, including plants, invertebrates, birds and ecosystem function. We undertook a comprehensive study to determine the impacts of house mice on Antipodes Island, New Zealand. This study was done prior to mouse eradication to inform monitoring and restoration. We used invertebrate pitfall trapping on the main Antipodes Island and neighbouring mouse-free offshore islands together with mouse stomach contents and stable isotope analyses of mouse livers to examine dietary preferences. We identified directly impacted and consumed invertebrate Orders relative to their abundance and provided a comprehensive picture of resource flow and overlap in the invaded terrestrial ecosystem. The remote terrestrial ecosystem of Antipodes Island was tightly circumscribed with strong resource overlap. Mouse diet varied seasonally with resource availability, dominated by invertebrates and land birds in summer, and plants and seabirds in winter. Invertebrates that were preferentially preyed upon were Amphipoda, Lepidoptera and some species of Coleoptera. These patterns suggest the ecosystem is annually driven by a seasonal bottom-up resource pulse over summer, where mice are a selective predator, differentially preying on invertebrates relative to invertebrate abundance. Mice appear to be exhausting preferred prey as they systematically consume their way through the terrestrial ecosystem. Land bird diet also varied seasonally and some of these birds likely competed with mice for invertebrate prey. Eradication of mice from Antipodes Island should reduce the predation on invertebrates and reduce the effects of competition and predation on land birds. This should have flow-on effects to the abundance of invertebrates and endemic land bird sub-species of pipit and snipe.

",,,,"Rapid and widespread biodiversity losses around the world make it important to survey and monitor endangered species, especially in biodiversity hotspots. Bukit Barisan Selatan National Park (BBSNP) is one of the largest conserved areas on the island of Sumatra, and is important for the conservation of many threatened species. Sumatran tigers (Panthera tigris sumatrae) are critically endangered and serve as an umbrella species for conservation, but may also affect the activity and distribution of other carnivores. We deployed camera traps for 8 years in an area of Bukit Barisan Selatan National Park (BBSNP) with little human activity to document the local terrestrial mammal community and investigate tiger spatial and temporal overlap with other carnivore species. We detected 39 mammal species including Sumatran tiger and several other threatened mammals. Annual species richness averaged 21.5 (range 19–24) mammals, and remained stable over time. The mammal order significantly affected annual detection of species and the number of cameras where a species was detected, while species conservation status did not. Tigers exhibited a diurnal activity pattern, and had the highest temporal overlap with marbled cats (Pardofelis marmorata), dholes (Cuon alpinus), and Malayan sun bears (Helarctos malayanus), but little overlap with other carnivores. These findings suggest that some smaller carnivores might be adjusting temporal activity to avoid tigers or mesocarnivores. The stable trends in richness of terrestrial mammal species show that BBSNP remains an important hotspot for the conservation of biodiversity.

",,,,"Abstract Habitat loss and non‐native species are two key drivers of biodiversity decline. The importance of their interactions is widely recognized, but remains poorly understood. We used the endemic‐rich bird assemblage of São Tomé Island to study this type of interactions. We built species‐specific binomial generalized linear models for 33 terrestrial bird species, based on presence–absence data from 2398 sampling points. Meta‐analysis techniques revealed that land use was more important in explaining distribution than topographic variables, rainfall, or distance to coast for the studied bird species. Native species were more likely to occur in remote rainy forests at higher altitudes, whereas non‐native species were more likely to occur in non‐forested ecosystems, being associated with humanized lowland areas in the drier flat regions of São Tomé. The susceptibility of anthropogenic ecosystems to the establishment of non‐native birds suggests that disturbance favours these species. An analysis of species feeding guilds further suggests that these habitat associations might be linked to resource availability, as a large proportion of non‐native species rely on seeds, which are clearly more available outside the best‐preserved forests. Contrarily, very few native birds seem to be using this resource, and instead rely on more complex ecological interaction, such as carnivory and frugivory. This difference may reduce the chance of negative interactions between native and non‐native species (e.g. competition), but this should not be misunderstood for a lack of negative effects of the latter. Our results indicate that land‐use intensification is the key driver of biodiversity changes on São Tomé, potentially facilitating the expansion of non‐native species and demoting ecological complexity. Therefore, protecting the best‐preserved forests is the single most important measure to ensure the conservation of native species.

",,,,"Abstract
Aim To determine the composition and biogeographical origins of the native and naturalized flora of braided shingle riverbeds in New Zealand and whether the proportion of naturalized species is greater than in similar habitats elsewhere in the world. To test whether regional species pools, landscape matrix configuration, and local riverbed environment are all equally important in determining community structure in these systems.

Location The braided reaches of four catchments on each of the eastern and western sides of North Island and South Island, New Zealand.

Methods Plotless records of all native and naturalized seed plant and fern species on disturbed mobile surfaces were made over the length of four rivers. Altitude, climate variables, riverbed attributes, and surrounding land-cover from maps were recorded for each site. For all species, the taxonomy, life form, origin and history, and presence within the province through which the rivers flowed, was obtained from published floras. Direct and indirect ordination and variance partitioning were employed to examine how native and naturalized species composition varies among and within rivers, and the degree to which this variation reflects climate, characteristic of riverbeds, and the surrounding land-cover. Regression was used to determine how much introduction date and native geographical range influence the frequency of naturalized species.

Results The total riverbed flora of 289 species comprises 40% native species and 60% naturalized species, both dominated by Asteraceae and Poaceae. The relative contributions of other plant families differ, and the two groups comprise different life-form spectra. Native species occur across fewer rivers (mean 1.6 rivers) than naturalized species (mean 2.1 rivers). Species common in at least one river system tend to be widespread, occurring in at least three rivers. The rivers differ in their floras, with distinctions between North Island and South Island, and eastern and western rivers. The South Island rivers have more native species and a higher proportion of their regional native species pools than North Island rivers, whereas they have a lower proportion of their naturalized species pools. Introduction date and native geographical range are correlated with frequency of individual naturalized species. Geographical position and climate, riverbed variables of substrate size and seepage presence, and the type of adjacent land-cover, differ between rivers and are significantly related to species composition. Land-cover variables alone account for 46% of the explained variation in species composition, environmental variables alone 32% and components of the environment and land-cover that co-vary, 22%.

Main conclusions New Zealand shingle riverbeds are among the riparian communities in the world most invaded by naturalized species but comparisons are difficult because studies of similar riverbeds are rare. New Zealand riverbeds are dominated by short-lived terrestrial species from Eurasia. Native species are most frequent in South Island rivers draining extensive high mountains, and their abundances are determined to a greater extent by riverbed processes than are those of the naturalized species, which are more abundant when the surrounding landscape is modified. The distribution of the naturalized flora is not yet at equilibrium with the environment. Each river has a distinctive flora determined by ambient environmental factors, aspects of the riverbed environment itself, adjacent land-cover reflecting the presence of native vegetation, the intensity of human modification or use, and invasion history.","0305-0270

This dataset can be used to address theoretical questions about plant strategy and trade‐offs, trait–environment relationships and environmental filtering, and trait variation across spatial scales, to validate satellite data, and to inform Earth system model parameters. Main types of variable contained The database contains 91,970 measurements of 18 plant traits. The most frequently measured traits (&gt; 1,000 observations each) include plant height, leaf area, specific leaf area, leaf fresh and dry mass, leaf dry matter content, leaf nitrogen, carbon and phosphorus content, leaf C:N and N:P, seed mass, and stem specific density. Spatial location and grain Measurements were collected in tundra habitats in both the Northern and Southern Hemispheres, including Arctic sites in Alaska, Canada, Greenland, Fennoscandia and Siberia, alpine sites in the European Alps, Colorado Rockies, Caucasus, Ural Mountains, Pyrenees, Australian Alps, and Central Otago Mountains (New Zealand), and sub‐Antarctic Marion Island. More than 99% of observations are georeferenced. Time period and grain All data were collected between 1964 and 2018.

",,,,"Abstract The unique marine and terrestrial ecosystems of the Galapagos Islands are highly vulnerable to human-based drivers of change, including the introduction of invasive species, unsustainable tourism, illegal fishing, overexploitation of ecosystem services, and climate change. These drivers can interact with climate-based drivers such as El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) at multiple temporal and spatial scales, exacerbating their negative impacts on already fragile ecosystems and the socioeconomic system of the Archipelago. In this review, we performed a literature review based on published literature from 1945 to 2020 and local and global climate databases to analyze drivers of change in the Galapagos. We developed and applied a spatial impact assessment model to identify high-ecological value areas with high sensitivity and exposure scores to environmental change drivers. We identified 13 priority HEVA that encompass ca. 23% (14,715 km 2 ) of the Galapagos Archipelago, distributed in nearly 3% of the Galapagos Marine Reserve and 20% Galapagos National Park. Current and future impacts are likely to concentrate on the inhabited islands’ highlands, whereas marine impacts concentrate along most of the Galapagos Islands’ shorelines. These results are important for guiding the design and implementation of adaptation measures aimed at increasing ecosystem resilience and human adaptive capacity in the face of global environmental change. Overall, these results will be valuable in their application for preserving Galapagos biota, securing the provision of vital ecosystem services for resident human populations, and sustaining the nature-based tourism industry.

",,"Wiley
",,,,"Questions
We addressed three questions: (1) what is the variation of α- and β-diversity of bryophyte communities across spatial scales in an elevational gradient; (2) is spatial variation characteristic of different phylogenetic (mosses/liverworts) and/or ecological groups (terrestrials/epiphytes); and (3) what is the contribution of species richness and species replacement (true turnover) to β-diversity along the elevational gradient?

Location
La Palma, Canary Islands, Spain.

Methods
An elevational transect spanning 0–2200 m a.s.l was sampled at altitudinal intervals of ca. 200 m, two 10 m × 10 m plots were established at each elevation and inside each plot three 2 m × 2 m quadrats were randomly selected. Within each quadrat, bryophytes were sampled in three replicate microplots of 10 cm × 5 cm, for each substrate: soil, rocks, leaves, humus, decaying wood and tree trunks at three heights. We evaluated α- and β-diversity at plot and elevational level for all bryophytes and for phylogenetic and ecological groups. Values of β-diversity were further decomposed into replacement and richness differences. We tested the relationship between α- and β-diversity and elevation using linear models with and without a quadratic term (elevation2) in an AICc-based framework.

Results
A total of 121 species were recorded along the transect. Alpha-diversity showed a hump-shaped pattern with elevation for all bryophytes, liverworts and epiphytic species, however, terrestrial species and mosses displayed no clear pattern. Species replacement was the main driver of β-diversity for all bryophytes and also for mosses and terrestrial species, and at different scales (elevational belt and quadrat). The contribution of species replacement increased with elevation, except for epiphytes and terrestrials.

Conclusions
Our study contributes towards an understanding of the spatial organization of bryophyte diversity at different scales along an insular elevational gradient. We showed that bryophyte diversity was mostly influenced by species replacement at the largest scale. The observed differences in β-diversity decomposition between bryophyte phylogenetic and ecological groups could be dependent on climatic conditions and substrate availability. The strong differences observed along the elevational gradient related to true turnover are especially important in the current global change scenario.","1100-9233

The model is based on data from remote sensors (satellite images, aerial photography and panoramic photography), and from field data processed through a geographical information system. The nests of Sula granti prevail on the surfaces of Malpelo Island and neighboring islets, while those of the remaining species (S. sula, Creagrus furcatus, Anous stolidus, A. minutus and Gygis alba) are spatially restricted to the cliff margins and to crevices or caverns at different heights. The presence of terrestrial predators and predatory birds (Fregata spp.) seems to mainly explain the marginal distribution of other breeding species. The cartographic data presented here differ significantly from past and current representations, especially those concerning the islandʼs emerged surface and other geomorphologic features.

",,,,"Mammals comprise the bulk of the diet of free-ranging domestic cats Felis catus (defined as including outdoor pet cats, strays, and feral cats) in most parts of their global range. In Australia, predation by introduced feral cats has been implicated in the extinction of many mammal species, and in the ongoing decline of many extant species.

Here, we collate a wide range of records of predation by cats (including feral and pet cats) on Australian mammals and model traits of extant, terrestrial, native mammal species associated with the relative likelihood of cat predation. We explicitly seek to overcome biases in such a continental-scale compilation by excluding possible carrion records for larger species and accounting for differences in the distribution and abundance of potential prey species, as well as study effort, throughout each species’ range.

For non-volant species, the relative likelihood of predation by cats was greatest for species in an intermediate weight range (peaking at ca. 400 g), in lower rainfall areas and not dwelling in rocky habitats. Previous studies have shown the greatest rates of decline and extinction in Australian mammals to be associated with these traits. As such, we provide the first continental-scale link between mammal decline and cat predation through quantitative analysis.

Our compilation of cat predation records for most extant, terrestrial, native mammal species (151 species, or 52% of the Australian species’ complement) is substantially greater than previously reported (88 species) and includes 50 species listed as threatened by the IUCN or under Australian legislation (57% of Australia's 87 threatened terrestrial mammal species). We identify the Australian mammal species most likely to be threatened by predation by cats (mulgaras Dasycercus spp., kowari Dasyuroides byrnei, many smaller dasyurids and medium-sized to large rodents, among others) and hence most likely to benefit from enhanced mitigation of cat impacts, such as translocations to predator-free islands, the establishment of predator-proof fenced exclosures, and broad-scale cat poison baiting.","0305-1838

",,,,"Abstract Hispaniola is a geotectonically complex island consisting of two palaeo‐islands that docked c. 10 Ma, with a further geological boundary subdividing the southern palaeo‐island into eastern and western regions. All three regions have been isolated by marine barriers during the late Cenozoic and possess biogeographically distinct terrestrial biotas. However, there is currently little evidence to indicate whether Hispaniolan mammals show distributional patterns reflecting this geotectonic history, as the island’s endemic land mammal fauna is now almost entirely extinct. We obtained samples of Hispaniolan hutia ( Plagiodontia aedium ), one of the two surviving Hispaniolan land mammal species, through fieldwork and historical museum collections from seven localities distributed across all three of the island’s biogeographic regions. Phylogenetic analysis using mitochondrial DNA (cytochrome b ) reveals a pattern of historical allopatric lineage divergence in this species, with the spatial distribution of three distinct hutia lineages biogeographically consistent with the island’s geotectonic history. Coalescent modelling, approximate Bayesian computation and approximate Bayes factor analyses support our phylogenetic inferences, indicating near‐complete genetic isolation of these biogeographically separate populations and differing estimates of their effective population sizes. Spatial congruence of hutia lineage divergence is not however matched by temporal congruence with divergences in other Hispaniolan taxa or major events in Hispaniola’s geotectonic history; divergence between northern and southern hutia lineages dates to c. 0.6 Ma, significantly later than the unification of the palaeo‐islands. The three allopatric Plagiodontia populations should all be treated as distinct management units for conservation, with particular attention required for the northern population (low haplotype diversity) and the south‐western population (high haplotype diversity but highly threatened).

",,,,"In recent decades the grass Phragmites australis has been aggressively invading coastal, tidal marshes of North America, and in many areas it is now considered a nuisance species. While P. australis has historically been restricted to the relatively benign upper border of brackish and salt marshes, it has been expanding seaward into more physiologically stressful regions. Here we test a leading hypothesis that the spread of P. australis is due to anthropogenic modification of coastal marshes. We did a field experiment along natural borders between stands of P. australis and the other dominant grasses and rushes (i.e., matrix vegetation) in a brackish marsh in Rhode Island, USA. We applied a pulse disturbance in one year by removing or not removing neighboring matrix vegetation and adding three levels of nutrients (specifically nitrogen) in a factorial design, and then we monitored the aboveground performance of P. australis and the matrix vegetation. Both disturbances increased the density, height, and biomass of shoots of P. australis, and the effects of fertilization were more pronounced where matrix vegetation was removed. Clearing competing matrix vegetation also increased the distance that shoots expanded and their reproductive output, both indicators of the potential for P. australis to spread within and among local marshes. In contrast, the biomass of the matrix vegetation decreased with increasing severity of disturbance. Disturbance increased the total aboveground production of plants in the marsh as matrix vegetation was displaced by P. australis. A greenhouse experiment showed that, with increasing nutrient levels, P. australis allocates proportionally more of its biomass to aboveground structures used for spread than to belowground structures used for nutrient acquisition. Therefore, disturbances that enrich nutrients or remove competitors promote the spread of P. australis by reducing belowground competition for nutrients between P. australis and the matrix vegetation, thus allowing P. australis, the largest plant in the marsh, to expand and displace the matrix vegetation. Reducing nutrient load and maintaining buffers of matrix vegetation along the terrestrial–marsh ecotone will, therefore, be important methods of control for this nuisance species.","1051-0761

The extent to which the biota support this hypothesis of greater oceanicity have been debated. Here, Pemba's terrestrial mollusc (""land-snail"") fauna is surveyed and reviewed for the first time. We find at best equivocal evidence for the following hallmarks of greater oceanicity: impoverishment, imbalance, and a high rate of endemism. At least 49 species are present, families are represented in typical proportions, and there are only between two and four island-endemic species - i.e. a 4% to 8% rate of endemism. For land-snails, isolation thus seems to have been short (Pleistocene) or, if longer, weak. Nevertheless, Pemba does host endemic and globally rare species. Forty-five percent of the species found, including most of these, is restricted to forest reserves, with Ngezi Forest Reserve particularly rich. A further 45% are able to tolerate the island's woody cultivated habitats.

Furthermore, scientific investigations are relatively recent. Scientific records of the terrestrial invertebrate fauna begin in the mid-19th century with species inventories and community descriptions but experimental field-based studies and physiological investigations did not commence until the 1980s.

There is hence a dramatic and rapid increase in our understanding, which is not only improving our comprehension of Arctic ecosystem functioning but also providing a baseline for environmental change studies.

Resolving the tree of life is among the greatest challenges for modern biology, yet genetic data for many species are lacking to infer their position in the tree with confidence. In fact, little is known about what the missing species are and where to look for them. I identify main hotspots that host the most unsampled vertebrate species and test the hypothesis that local diversity determines the degree of sampling effort.

Location
Global.

Taxon
Terrestrial vertebrates (amphibians, birds, mammals, reptiles).

Methods
I use published distributional data and search DNA sequence repositories to identify taxa with no genetic data available. I map spatial patterns of the unsampled diversity and sampling effort to test the effect of species richness on sampling completeness. I examine the dependence of country-level sampling completeness on the country's socio-economic development.

Results
About 24% of living terrestrial vertebrate species have no genetic data available. The Andes, Central Africa and the Malay Archipelago are the most unsampled. Sampling effort is highest in North America, continental South-East Asia and Amazonia. In contrast, Central Africa, the Horn of Africa, Malay Archipelago and Andes are consistently the least sampled regions. Regions of low diversity are better sampled than biodiversity hotspots.

",,,,"Among the 15 known genera of murine rodents endemic to the island of Sulawesi, is the shrew rat genus Echiothrix. Physically large (length of head and body = 182–235 mm; weight = 215–310 g) with a bicolored tail typically longer than head and body (100%–135% of head and body length), elongate hind feet (48–55 mm), large ears (31–35 mm), long and thin muzzle, spinous fur, and tiny molars relative to size of skull (length of molar row = 12%–13% of occipitonasal length), Echiothrix was named and described in 1867 and through the years has been treated as monotypic or containing up to three species. Results from analyses of morphometric traits derived primarily from cranial and dental measurements document the presence of two species. Echiothrix leucura (Gray, 1867) is restricted to the northern peninsular mainland east of the Gorontalo region (00°31′ N, 123° 03′ E). This distribution is concordant with that of four other murids endemic to the northeastern tip of the northern peninsula: Bunomys fratrorum, Taeromys taerae, Rattus xanthurus, and R. marmosurus. Echiothrix centrosa Miller and Hollister, 1921 (Echiothix brevicula Miller and Hollister, 1921, is a synonym), is documented by specimens from the northern peninsula west of the Gorontalo region and in the central portion of the island; 19 other murine species are also known only from the core of Sulawesi. Whether the range of E. centrosa extends to the eastern, southeastern, and southwestern peninsulas is at present unknown. Echiothrix leucura has a more elongate skull compared with E. centrosa (greater lengths of skull, rostrum, diastema, and bony palate), a wider interorbital region, larger braincase, narrower bony palate and mesopterygoid fossa, shorter incisive foramina, and appreciably larger molars; the two species also differ in frequencies of particular molar cusps and cusplets. Both species of Echiothrix are nocturnal, terrestrial, and occupy habitats in tropical lowland evergreen rain forest. Natural history observations made in the field for Echiothrix centrosa show it to be primarily vermivorous; other natural history observations derived from field work in central Sulawesi are provided. One aspect of that natural history is the ectoparasitic load borne by E. centrosa. This shrew rat is host to at least four species of ticks (Haemaphysalis kadarsani, Haemaphysalis hystricis, Haemaphysalis sp. and Amblyomma sp.), a tiny fur mite (Listrophoroides echiothrix), mesostigmatid mites belonging to the genus Laelaps, currently undetermined chiggers, a flea (Farhangia quattuordecimdentata), and a new species of sucking louse described herein as Polyplax beaucournui. This louse has tibiotarsal claws adapted for grasping slender soft hairs in the pelage and not the wide host spines; female lice also attach their eggs only to these slender hairs. The closest relative of Echiothrix is probably Paucidentomys vermidax, another Sulawesian endemic shrew rat that is also vermivorous but lacks molars and has been collected only in montane forests. The present report documents morphological and distributional limits of species in Echiothrix, places one of those species in an ecological and parasitological landscape, and generally contributes to knowledge covering endemic murid species diversity and identifying unique zoogeographical areas on Sulawesi.

",,,,"The vertebrate fauna of the Philippines, known for its diversity and high proportion of endemic species, comprises mainly small- to medium-sized forms with a few large exceptions. As with other tropical ecosystems, the major threats to wildlife are habitat loss, hunting and invasive species, of which the feral cat ( Felis catus ) is considered the most damaging. Our camera-trapping study focused on a terrestrial vertebrate species inventory on Bohol Island and tempo-spatial co-occurrences of feral cats with their prey and competitors. The survey took place in the Rajah Sikatuna Protected Landscape, and we examined the primary rainforest, its border with agricultural land, and rural areas in the vicinity of villages. Altogether, over 2,885 trap days we captured 30 species of vertebrates–10 mammals (including Sus philippensis ), 19 birds and one reptile, Varanus cumingi . We trapped 81.8% of expected vertebrates. Based on the number of events, the most frequent native species was the barred rail ( Gallirallus torquatus ). The highest overlap in diel activity between cats and potential prey was recorded with rodents in rural areas (Δ = 0.62); the lowest was in the same habitat with ground-dwelling birds (Δ = 0.40). Cat activity was not recorded inside the rainforest; in other habitats their diel activity pattern differed. The cats’ activity declined in daylight in the proximity of humans, while it peaked at the transition zone between rainforest and fields. Both rodents and ground-dwelling birds exhibited a shift in activity levels between sites where cats were present or absent. Rodents tend to become active by day in cat-free habitats. No cats’ temporal response to co-occurrences of civets ( Paradoxurus hermaphroditus and Viverra tangalunga ) was found but cats in diel activity avoided domestic dogs ( Canis lupus familiaris ). Our first insight into the ecology of this invasive predator in the Philippines revealed an avoidance of homogeneous primary rainforest and a tendency to forage close to human settlements in heterogeneous habitats. A detailed further investigation of the composition of the cat’s diet, as well as ranging pattern, is still needed.

",,"Wiley
",,,,"1. A review is presented of the information relating to the distribution of free-living terrestrial Cryptostigmata, Prostigmata and Collembola in the south polar region.

2. The Maritime zone, comprising the Antarctic Peninsula and its neighbouring islands, forms a less-clearly definable faunal province than does the Continental zone where generic and specific endemism is high. The Maritime distribution of the micro-arthropods forms no consistent pattern, although in the case of the two groups of mites a distinction can be made between a southern and a northern Maritime fauna. The boundary between these two elements appears to lie between the South Orkneys and the South Sandwich Islands.

3. As far as distribution in the Sub-Antarctic is concerned, all three groups of micro-arthropods show certain general similarities, although in each case particular features can also be distinguished. All three show relatively high specific endemism in the Sub-Antartcic, which sugge:ts that this zone is a faunal province distinct from that of the cold temperate zone to the north and other parts of the Antarctic to the south. It seems equally reasonable to recognize that this province can be subdivided into western and eastern parts, each with its own distinct group of species, although the extent to which this separation is expressed varies from group to group. In all three groups there is an element which is circum-Sub-Antarctic in distribution, but this element is more in evidence in the Collembola than in the mites. From the study of the distribution of endemic species in the Sub-Antarctic it is concluded that the fauna of the eastern part has been isolated from the south temperate zone fauna for longer than it has in the west.

4. In all three groups of micro-arthropods a relic element can be identified, the present distribution of which is consistent with the idea of a former continuous distribution extending across a southern land mass incorporating both the eastern and western parts of the continent, the islands on the Scotia Ridge, and the older Sub-Antarctic islands of South Georgia, Macquarie and, possibly, Kerguelen. In the Cryptostigmata in particular, this relic element, which is represented by members of the Podacaridae, is joined in the Sub-Antarctic and Maritime zones by a penetrant element which probably has invaded the south polar region from the north during the post-Pleistocene period.

5. An alternative hypothesis is also discussed, namely that present distribution patterns of micro-arthropods can be explained solely in terms of post-Pleistocene colonization. It is accepted that limited overseas dispersal could have occurred in recent times, indeed may still be occurring between, for example, the various volcanic islands in the eastern Sub-Antarctic, between the south temperate zone and the Sub-Antarctic, and between the latter and the Maritime zone. However, there is no evidence to suggest that any appreciable amount of long-range dispersal is occurring, on the scale required to support this hypothesis. In addition, there is no evidence that rates of speciation in the south polar region are rapid enough to produce the kind of evolutionary divergence which is implicit in the theory of post-Pleistocene colonization.","0006-3231

",,"Wiley
",,,,"Classic island biogeography theory predicts that very small islands, near the extreme lower end of the species-area relationship, should support very few species. At times no species may be present, however, due to randomness in the immigration-extinction dynamics. Alternatively, a lack of vegetation on very small islands may indicate that such islands do not contain the appropriate habitat for the establishment or long-term survival of plants, or that disturbances are too frequent or intense. These potential mechanisms were evaluated in the central Exumas, Bahamas, where surveys of 117 small islands revealed that over a third of the islands supported no terrestrial plant life. Area and exposure were significant predictors of whether a small island was vegetated or not in multiple logistic regressions. No islands naturally devoid of vegetation were colonized over a 17-yr period, and only two naturally vegetated islands lost all vegetation. Experimental introductions of two species — Sesuvium portulacastrum and Borrichia arborescens -revealed that a number of naturally lacking vegetation were able to sustain introduced populations over the long term (up to 15 yr). Drought and hurricanes appeared to have reduced the establishment success and possibly long-term survival of the introductions, although some populations survived four major hurricanes. Turnover rates of both introduced species were often an order of magnitude higher on the experimental introduction islands than on other islands in the archipelago. It appears many of the islands in this system that naturally lack vegetation may be physically capable of supporting terrestrial plant life, yet have no plants primarily due to barriers to colonization.","0906-7590

Some islands support high densities of nesting seabirds, while others have been invaded by predatory rats and host few seabirds. Our results show that, by preying upon seabirds, rats have indirectly enhanced C sequestration in live plant biomass by 104%, reduced C sequestration in non-living pools by 26% and increased total ecosystem C storage by 37%. Given the current worldwide distribution of rats and other invasive predatory mammals, and the consequent disappearance of seabird colonies, these predators may be important determinants of ecosystem C sequestration.

",,,,"Questions
Terrestrial vegetation is assumed to be highly vulnerable to climate change in the Arctic, which has experienced the highest rates of temperature increase globally over the past decades. However, long-term studies at the community scale are rare, particularly for the European High Arctic. We ask: (1) has Arctic vegetation changed over the past century; (2) can observed changes be related to recent climate change; and (3) do observed changes in vegetation prevail for specific species or species functional groups?

Location
The Svalbard Archipelago, High Arctic Norway.

Methods
In 2009 we resurveyed three plant sociological studies up to 85 yrs after the first surveys. Vegetation data were recorded from 1-m2 non-permanently marked plots, and soil pH was measured. We applied restricted permutation tests to evaluate whether observed changes in vegetation (species richness, occurrence frequency, coverage) and in soil pH were significant and independent of plant community type. We compared species co-occurrences over time to study changes in species composition and to identify the species most likely causing these changes.

Results
Total number of species and average number of species per plot has not changed, and are 75 and nine, respectively. Occurrence frequency changed significantly for 34% of the 64 species tested (11 species increased, 11 decreased). Species cover decreased significantly for 27% of the species and increased for one species. Observed changes in frequency and cover are not significantly related to species’ functional groups or species affiliated to moist or dry habitats. Polygonum viviparum, Saxifraga cernua and Alopecurus borealis have changed most in co-occurring with other species. Soil pH increased significantly from 6.4 to 6.8.

Conclusions
Our results suggest that the strong climatic warming in the High Arctic over the past decades has contributed to significant changes in the vegetation studied on Svalbard over the past 85 yrs. Internal community restructuring and the overall stability in species richness may be explained by time-delayed responses of well-established communities, and/or by a limited size of the species pool in the area.","1402-2001

",,,,"The importance of long-distance dispersal (LDD) in shaping geographical distributions has been debated since the nineteenth century. In terrestrial vertebrates, LDD events across large water bodies are considered highly improbable, but organismal traits affecting dispersal capacity are generally not taken into account. Here, we focus on a recent lizard radiation and combine a summary-coalescent species tree based on 1225 exons with a probabilistic model that links dispersal capacity to an evolving trait, to investigate whether ecological specialization has influenced the probability of trans-oceanic dispersal. Cryptoblepharus species that occur in coastal habitats have on average dispersed 13 to 14 times more frequently than non-coastal species and coastal specialization has, therefore, led to an extraordinarily widespread distribution that includes multiple continents and distant island archipelagoes. Furthermore, their presence across the Pacific substantially predates the age of human colonization and we can explicitly reject the possibility that these patterns are solely shaped by human-mediated dispersal. Overall, by combining new analytical methods with a comprehensive phylogenomic dataset, we use a quantitative framework to show how coastal specialization can influence dispersal capacity and eventually shape geographical distributions at a macroevolutionary scale.

",,,,"Over the past four decades, many researchers have applied the theory of island biogeography (IBT) to predict and understand species loss and distribution in fragmented landscapes. Recent studies found that specialist species were more affected by fragment size and isolation than generalists. However, the mechanisms underlying different effects of area and isolation among specialists and generalists are unknown. We tested the predictions of IBT on butterfly assemblages in Tokyo, Japan, and hypothesized that the effects of fragment size and isolation would be stronger for specialists than for generalists. We classified butterfly species into specialists and generalists for each of two dimensions (food range and voltinism) and according to tolerance to the matrix. We recorded 26 feeding specialists and 27 generalists, 24 seasonal specialists and 29 generalists, 32 low matrix-tolerant species and 21 high matrix-tolerant species in 20 forest fragments. We used generalized linear models to relate the number of species in a fragment to fragment size and isolation (distance to the mainland). The averaged models based on AICc showed that fragment size had positive and significant effects on both specialist and generalist and high matrix-tolerant butterfly species richness. However, the negative effects of isolation on species richness were only found in specialist and low matrix-tolerant species. Our results demonstrate that patch isolation only affects specialist species. This suggests that when applying IBT to terrestrial fragmented landscapes, researchers should be careful not to overlook patch area and isolation effects on specialists.","1341-6979

The 9.0 magnitude earthquake that struck the eastern coast of Japan in 2011, and the subsequent 38 m high tsunami washed large amounts of shoreline debris into the Pacific Ocean that led to a large‐scale biological rafting event carrying nearly 300 marine species to the western shores of North America. Whether oceanic, trans‐Pacific dispersal via rafting generates long distance dispersal events for small, flightless, terrestrial species is unknown. By sampling beach debris associated with known hot‐spots of tsunami debris along the north and east shores of Graham Island, Haida Gwaii, Canada, I document significantly dissimilar invertebrate communities associated with tide‐line beach debris and the occurrence of several putative Japanese species of soil‐dwelling mites (Acari: Oribatida). Previous explanations of Haida Gwaii's unique flora and fauna have been attributed to a proximity to the Beringian land bridge and the accumulated evidence of near‐offshore glacial refugia during the last glacial period.

",,,,,,"Palmyra Atoll National Wildlife Refuge is a moist Central Pacific atoll that supports one of the best remaining tropical forest ecosystems in the region, including 10 species of breeding seabirds and a robust population of the world’s largest terrestrial invertebrate, the coconut crab. Despite these riches, the atoll’s ecosystem has been modified by introduced black rats that were inadvertently brought to Palmyra during WWII. Between June 1 and 30, 2011, a partnership between the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, The Nature Conservancy, and Island Conservation successfully implemented a project to remove rats from Palmyra. Independent monitoring of bait application and its environmental effects was undertaken by the USDA. Over the 28-day operation, a team of 41 people from 5 countries utilized 2 helicopters, 10 slingshots, 148 bait stations, and hand spreading to strategically apply 38,561 kg of rodent bait containing the anticoagulant brodifacoum (25 ppm) to Palmyra’s 235 hectares of emergent land. Palmyra’s challenging eradication environment demanded the development of a novel approach, such as broadcast application rates between 75 and 85 kg/ha and the use of “bolas” to bait coastal forest canopy to minimize bait drift into the marine environment. Initial findings show minimal non-target impacts as a result of the project, and post-eradication monitoring has failed to detect rats. Increased recruitment by at least 2 native tree species has been observed. By removing rats from Palmyra, the partnership aims to safeguard the atoll’s indigenous flora and fauna, encourage the reestablishment of extirpated seabird species, and create an ecological refuge for species within the Central Pacific region that are at risk of extinction. This project is a conservation milestone for the Refuge, and it has established a benchmark for eradication campaigns on other tropical islands.

",,,,"Maritime Antarctica is one of the major terrestrial ecosystems dominated by lichens and mosses, which represent important ecological indicators. Thus, we aimed to evaluate the changes in associated communities of mosses-lichens diversity and coverage along a pedoenvironmental gradient on Half Moon Island, Maritime Antarctica. We focused on how patterns in associated communities of mosses-lichens species diversity (richness, species composition and beta diversity) and coverage are associated with soil properties using plant inventory data from 174 plots across 14 contrasting pedoenvironments. The results clearly show marked differences in soil properties along the pedoenvironmental gradient, which determine variations in species composition, richness and coverage. We presumed that these variations are common in Maritime Antarctica owing to varying periglacial processes, weathering degree, parent material and biological influence (especially by penguins and other birds). The community species richness and coverage along the pedoenvironmental gradient differ, nevertheless share common species present in most pedoenvironments, despite differences in coverage. We assume that most of the pedoenvironments are habitats to rare species that occur only under specific soil conditions, additionally promotes high β-diversity between pedoenvironments and low species similarity.

Cestodes, including Tetrabothrius laccocephalus, Tetrabothrius diomedea, Tetrabothrius filiformis, and metacestodes of Tetrabothrius sp., a strigeid trematode, Cardiocephaloides physalis, and an acanthocephalan, Corynosoma australe, occurred in the small intestine. Nematodes, Seuratia shipleyi and larvae of Contracaecum sp., were found in the proventriculus. Great shearwaters had not previously been recognized as hosts for T. filiformis, T. diomedea, and Cardiocephaloides, while C. australe is reported for the first time in an avian host. Populations of the five most abundant and prevalent helminths (Tetrabothrius spp. and Cardiocephaloides) were overdispersed. The patterns of diversity (measured by Brillouin's index), species richness, and abundance in the intestinal helminth community from P. gravis were at the lower end of a continuum for equivalent communities in avian hosts from terrestrial and aquatic habitats. The predictable breeding phenology of P. gravis at Gough Island and the distribution of immature or recently acquired helminths indicated that the major component of the parasite fauna was derived in the South Atlantic Ocean adjacent to the breeding grounds during the austral spring. The distribution of helminth parasites of great shearwaters is discussed with reference to food habits and long-range migration of the hosts.","0008-4301

Thus, surveys on mangrove flora and fauna were conducted to assess current status and identify impact of development. A list of mangrove flora and fauna is produced. Terrestrial vertebrates (mammals, birds and herpetofauna) surveyed revealed a total of 68 species (8 species of mammals, 57 species of birds and 3 species of reptiles). Species composition and total standing above-ground biomass of mangrove trees in ten 10 x 10 m plots, totalling 0.4 ha area, were estimated at Pulau Indah and Pulau Che Mat Zin. Both islands are within the Klang Islands Mangrove Forest Reserves (MFR), which have been declining in forest cover. The total number of individual trees recorded in all 10 plots was 222 from 10 species of three families i.e. Rhizophoraceae, Avicenniaceae and Meliaceae. Rhizophora apiculata was the most dominant tree species with an Important Value Index (IVI) of 28.2, contributed mainly from the density (77 trees). The total basal area of the trees was of 23.96 m2/ha with R. apiculata making up most of the total value of 6.96 m2/ha. The estimated total above-ground biomass of mangrove trees in this study was 2300.1 kg/0.1 ha with the highest contribution from R. apiculata and Bruguiera gymnorrhiza. The estimated biomass was very low compared to other pristine mangrove forest at Matang or Langkawi. The causal factors identified included clear-felling activity, coastal erosion caused by wave actions from ships, oil pollution, reclamation, and other development activities.Kawasan bakau di Hutan Simpan Pulau-pulau Klang, Selangor, semakin berkurangan daripada segi luas dan kualiti kerana sebahagian kawasan telah digazet atau dikeluarkan daripada kawasan hutan simpan untuk ditebusguna tanah atau untuk pembangunan lain.

As a result, five extinct species (four geoemydids [Cuora sp., Geoemyda amamiensis, Mauremys sp., and another species with undetermined generic and specific status] and one testudinid [Manouria oyamai]) were recognized from Late Pleistocene cave and fissure deposits. Two of the three turtles currently occurring in this archipelago (C. flavomarginata and G. japonica) were also recognized from comparable deposits on islands, including those where they do not occur at present. These records indicate that the terrestrial turtles of the Ryukyus were much more diverse during the Late Pleistocene than at present, and that extinction has occurred during the last few tens of thousands of years not only for those five fossil species but also for some island populations of the extant species. Distributions of three of the extinct species (G. amamiensis, Cuora sp., and the geoemydid [genus and species undetermined]), confined to the central Ryukyus, are concordant with the currently prevailing hypothesis of Ryukyu paleogeography, which assumes a relatively long isolation of this region and much more recent insularization of the southern Ryukyus. In contrast, distributions of the remaining two extinct species (Man. oyamai and Mau. sp.) must be explained by some ad hoc scenario or, otherwise, drastic modification of the current hypothesis.","0030-8870

As predators can influence habitat use in rodents, Pearl Island was selected because no mammalian predators of rodents are present. Rats were trapped in two other habitats to clarify rat distribution on the island and to obtain samples for stable isotope investigation of food partitioning within habitats. The experimental removal of ship rats failed, as Pacific rats were found to share forest and shrubland with ship rats. This result contrasted with the restricted distribution of Pacific rats on Stewart Island. Ship rats were ubiquitous, and appear to have been the dominant species in podocarp-broadleaf forest on Pearl Island. The largest species, the Norway rat, was trapped only on the foreshore of Pearl Island but on Stewart Island it is more widespread. Ship rats and Norway rats were partitioning the coastal habitat by exploiting different food sources. Stable isotopic ratios (δ15N and δ13C) in muscle samples from Norway rats revealed a strong marine signature, suggesting intensive foraging in the intertidal zone. Ship rats trapped in the same habitat exhibited mixed terrestrial and marine sources in their diet. There was little obvious partitioning between ship rats and Pacific rats in forest, except a possible delay in breeding in Pacific rats relative to ship rats. Whether Norway rats select the intertidal zone to forage, or were excluded from forest by ship rats is unknown, but competitive exclusion is likely. Estimated densities of rats were low (2.1-5.1 rats ha-1 in forest, 1.42 rats ha-1 in shrubland) and similar to other New Zealand sites with low soil fertility. Further research will be required to elucite the roles of food quality, habitat structure and predation in facilitating habitat selection in these species.","0110-6465

",,,,"The Socotra Archipelago (Yemen) is an interesting biodiversity hotspot, with a significant proportion of endemic species that have evolved to survive in an arid subtropical environment, inscribed as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO. The terrestrial ecosystems of Socotra face several threats, including climate change, overgrazing and soil degradation. Socotra Island has four endemic species of the genus Commiphora (Burseraceae). Little is known about their local distribution and ecology, yet these trees could be useful indicator species. Our study focuses on the distribution and niche characterisation of the four endemic Commiphora species of Socotra and how climate change may affect them. The aim is to improve insights into their habitats and to provide an essential basis for future local management plans and ecological restoration. We compared the current distribution with the forecasted potential distribution under a CMIP6 (Coupled Model Intercomparison Project) climate scenario, allowing us to define target conservation areas and assess potential local extinction risks. To achieve this, we collected distribution data in the field throughout Socotra Island, covering the current distribution ranges of the four species. To assess the potential distribution of these species, we applied three models (GAM, MaxEnt, RandomForest) using bioclimatic, topographic and soil variables. Forecasts under a climate change scenario were made using bioclimatic variables from the CMCC-CESM2 climate model for two different socioeconomic pathways. The distribution of three endemic Socotran Commiphora is mainly correlated to clay content in the soil and winter precipitation, while C. socotrana is affected by seasonal precipitation and temperature. Under different potential future climate scenarios, the distribution of C. ornifolia is predicted to remain stable or increase, while C. parvifolia distribution could increase, yet C. planifrons and C. socotrana are predicted to undergo a strong reduction of suitable areas and an upward shift in the mountains. Our results highlight that it is essential to conserve the unique terrestrial ecosystems in Socotra and to preserve these endemic trees which have a wide range of ecosystem services. Updates on the predicted extinction risk assessment are fundamental to understand conservation priorities and strategize future actions to ensure the persistence of Socotran myrrh trees and other endangered endemic tree taxa on the island.

",,,,"Theory and experiment agree that climate warming will increase carbon fluxes between terrestrial ecosystems and the atmosphere. The effect of this increased exchange on terrestrial carbon storage is less predictable, with important implications for potential feedbacks to the climate system. We quantified how increased mean annual temperature (MAT) affects ecosystem carbon storage in above- and belowground live biomass and detritus across a well-constrained 5.2 °C MAT gradient in tropical montane wet forests on the Island of Hawaii. This gradient does not systematically vary in biotic or abiotic factors other than MAT (i.e. dominant vegetation, substrate type and age, soil water balance, and disturbance history), allowing us to isolate the impact of MAT on ecosystem carbon storage. Live biomass carbon did not vary predictably as a function of MAT, while detrital carbon declined by ~14 Mg of carbon ha−1 for each 1 °C rise in temperature – a trend driven entirely by coarse woody debris and litter. The largest detrital pool, soil organic carbon, was the most stable with MAT and averaged 48% of total ecosystem carbon across the MAT gradient. Total ecosystem carbon did not vary significantly with MAT, and the distribution of ecosystem carbon between live biomass and detritus remained relatively constant across the MAT gradient at ~44% and ~56%, respectively. These findings suggest that in the absence of alterations to precipitation or disturbance regimes, the size and distribution of carbon pools in tropical montane wet forests will be less sensitive to rising MAT than predicted by ecosystem models. This article also provides needed detail on how individual carbon pools and ecosystem-level carbon storage will respond to future warming.","1354-1013

It is therefore crucial to understand the degree of consensus or divergence among scientists on core scientific perceptions and strategies most likely to achieve given objectives. I developed an internet survey designed to elucidate the opinions of conservation scientists. Conservation scientists (n =583) were unanimous (99.5%) in their view that a serious loss of biological diversity is likely, very likely, or virtually certain. Scientists' agreement that serious loss is very likely or virtually certain ranged from 72.8% for Western Europe to 90.9% for Southeast Asia. Tropical coral ecosystems were perceived as the most seriously affected by loss of biological diversity; 88.0% of respondents familiar with that ecosystem type agreed that a serious loss is very likely or virtually certain. With regard to conservation strategies, scientists most often viewed understanding how people and nature interact in certain contexts and the role of biological diversity in maintaining ecosystem function as their priorities. Protection of biological diversity for its cultural and spiritual values and because of its usefulness to humans were low priorities, which suggests that many scientists do not fully support the utilitarian concept of ecosystem services. Many scientists expressed a willingness to consider conservation triage, engage in active conservation interventions, and consider reframing conservation goals and measures of success for conservation of biological diversity in an era of climate change. Although some heterogeneity of opinion is evident, results of the survey show a clear consensus within the scientific community on core issues of the extent and geographic scope of loss of biological diversity and on elements that may contribute to successful conservation strategies in the future. Resumen: Las grandes inversiones requeridas para frenar la pérdida de diversidad biológica probablemente llevarán a un mayor escrutinio público y político de las estrategias de conservación y de la ciencia que las sustenta. Por lo tanto, es crucial entender el grado de consenso o divergencia entre científicos sobre las percepciones y estrategias científicas planteadas para alcanzar ciertos objetivos. Desarrollé un muestreo por internet para aclarar las opiniones de científicos de la conservación. Científicos de la conservación (n =583) fueron unánimes (99.5%) en opinar que una pérdida severa de diversidad biológica es posible, muy posible o virtualmente cierta. El acuerdo de los científicos respecto a que una pérdida severa es muy probable o virtualmente cierta varió de 72.8% en Europa Occidental a 90.9 en el sureste de Asia. Los ecosistemas de corales tropicales fueron percibidos como los más afectados por la pérdida de diversidad biológica; 88.0% de los encuestados familiarizados con ese tipo de ecosistema estuvo de acuerdo en que una pérdida severa es muy probable o virtualmente cierta. En relación con las estrategias de conservación, los científicos a menudo visualizaron como prioritario el entendimiento la interacción entre la gente y la naturaleza en ciertos contextos y el papel de la diversidad biológica en el mantenimiento de las funciones del ecosistema. La protección de la diversidad biológica por sus valores culturales y espirituales y por su utilidad para los humanos fueron prioridades bajas, lo que sugiere que muchos científicos no apoyan el concepto utilitario de los servicios ecosistémicos. Muchos científicos expresaron disponibilidad para considerar el triaje de conservación, involucrarse activamente en intervenciones de conservación y considerar el replanteamiento de metas de conservación y medidas de éxito para la conservación de la diversidad biológica en una era de cambio climático. Mientras que la heterogeneidad de opiniones es evidente, los resultados del muestreo muestran un consenso claro entre la comunidad científica respecto a temas centrales de la extensión y alcance geográfico de la pérdida de diversidad biológica y sobre elementos que pueden contribuir a estrategias de conservación exitosas en el futuro. The widespread loss of biological diversity poses a challenge for countries around the world for ecological, economic, and social reasons (Millennium Ecosystem Assessment 2005; SCBD 2010; TEEB 2010). As the extent of loss of biological diversity and its potential effects has gained recognition, a variety of policy responses have followed. For example, numerous national and state-level jurisdictions have implemented policy and regulations to protect endangered species, the International Union for Conservation of Nature Red List and Convention on Biological Diversity were created, and the Intergovernmental Panel on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) was formed recently. Responding to loss of biological diversity will require improvements in scientific modeling, long-term monitoring, active restoration efforts, and the creation and refinement of governance institutions (e.g., Pereira et al. 2010; Jones et al. 2011; Perrings et al. 2011), all of which will require significant investment. The investments needed if loss of biological diversity is to be stemmed will likely lead to increased public and political scrutiny of conservation strategies and the science underlying them. As in the climate-change debate (Anderegg et al. 2010; Rosenberg et al. 2010), supporters of strong action will likely argue that the science is clear and overwhelmingly consistent with action, whereas skeptics will argue that the science is highly uncertain and unworthy of use as a foundation for public policy. Thus, it will be crucial to understand the degree of consensus among conservation professionals on core scientific points and on feasible and preferred management interventions. Through an internet survey, I assessed the degree of convergence of scientific understanding and opinions on conservation strategies among conservation scientists. The survey addressed three themes: geographic and temporal scope of loss of biological diversity and scientists' level of understanding of the causes and effects of this loss; perceived importance of different conservation values; and level of agreement on some potentially controversial views in conservation science. The results from my survey provide a snapshot of scientists' current opinions on the loss of biological diversity globally and conservation strategies that might be used to reverse that loss. Understanding scientists' opinions could help policy makers interpret conflicting scientific advice, identify conservation options, and improve the likelihood of successful implementation of conservation initiatives. The survey had six sections. The first introduced the research and addressed survey ethics and data security (see Supporting Information for an example of a full survey). The second section asked about respondents' demographic and professional characteristics. The third section asked respondents' opinions about the geographic and temporal scope of loss of biological diversity by region and ecosystem type (""major habitat types"" of Olson and Dinerstein [1998]). I modified several questions from a survey that examined the views of climate scientists on the nature, causes, and effects of climate change (Rosenberg et al. 2010) and used language recommended for climate-science research (Morgan et al. 2009) to describe probabilities in qualitative and quantitative terms. The fourth section included a set of 16 best–worst scaling (BWS) questions (Flynn et al. 2007) to fully rank respondents' levels of agreement with 32 value-oriented statements developed by Sandbrook et al. (2011). The statements encompassed four dimensions within which diverse opinions had been expressed by young conservation scientists: values (why people care); priorities (how they should be set); geography (where conservation should take place); and actions (how conservation should be undertaken). The fifth section of the survey asked about respondents' levels of agreement with potentially controversial statements about conservation strategies. Of the 17 statements presented in the fifth section, I based 14 on responses from conservation experts interviewed by Hagerman et al (2010), who interviewed a small group of experts on biological diversity and adaptation to climate change. I emphasized conservation triage (i.e., the explicit decision not to treat a given population, species, or ecosystem knowing that a lack of effort will likely lead to possible extinction of that population or species or extreme alteration of the ecosystem). A final section, not reported here, queried respondents regarding possible reasons for a lack of conservation science uptake by policy makers. The survey was constructed with Sawtooth Software's (Sequim, Washington) SSI web-based interviewing platform. My sample frame included all authors who published from 2005 to 2010 in 19 international journals with downloadable abstracts and author information: AMBIO; Animal Conservation; Aquatic Conservation: Biodiversity and Conservation; Biological Invasions; BioScience; Conservation Biology; Conservation Letters; Diversity and Distributions; Ecological Economics; Environmental Conservation; Fish and Fisheries; Frontiers in Ecology and the Environment; Global Ecology and Biogeography; Human Dimensions of Wildlife; Insect Conservation and Diversity; Journal of Applied Ecology; Marine and Freshwater Ecosystems; Restoration Ecology; and Society and Natural Resources. I downloaded abstracts for 10,972 articles to Endnote. From this pool, I selected 531 articles (4.8% of the total), which included research articles, reviews, and editorials. The number of articles in the sample was proportional to the total number of articles published annually in each journal (Supporting Information). For journals that publish research not directly pertinent to the management of biological diversity (e.g., Ecological Economics publishes articles on energy policy and trade), I drew proportionally fewer articles overall, selecting only those with a clear biological-diversity theme. From these articles I drew a sample of 1826 authors to contact. I used email addresses provided in the articles or found them through a Google search. For each respondent that completed the survey, I calculated Hirsh's h index (Hirsch 2005), a proxy for scientific standing, with the bibliometric software Publish or Perish (version 3.1; Harzing 2010). An author who has published 50 papers with at least 50 citations each, for example, would have an h index of 50. Although h index is subject to potential errors (e.g., not all publications are found), it provides a relatively robust means of calculating scientific standing. For analysis, I aggregated h index scores into five categories with roughly equal numbers of respondents: ≤3 (n= 124); 4–6 (n= 103); 7–11 (n= 121); 12–19 (n= 123); and ≥20 (n= 112). I contacted authors up to five times (Dillman et al. 2009) over five weeks. I emailed a notice on 19 February 2011 that the survey was to follow and the main survey invitation on 1 March 2011. The invitation email contained a web link so that respondents could access the survey with a single click. I also sent the following additional emails (Supporting Information): a reminder notice on 6 March 2011 to nonrespondents, a second survey invitation to nonrespondents on 13 March 2011, and a final reminder to remaining nonrespondents on 29 March 2011. I used Sawtooth Software's BWS module to generate 300 versions of the BWS questions (Supporting Information) to which respondents were randomly assigned. Each of 16 BWS questions contained four statements about conservation strategies, scope, and values drawn from the full set of 32 statements. Respondents were asked to choose the statements with which they agreed most and least (Supporting Information). I analyzed data from the BWS ranking exercise with Sawtooth Software's Hierarchical Bayesian procedures (Sawtooth Software 2007). I used respondents' assessments of the likelihood of climate change and serious losses in biological diversity and their ratings of scientists' level of understanding of the causes and consequences of losses of biological diversity in 2-stage latent-class (LC) cluster analyses. First, LC clustering identified indicator variables that were strongly associated with an unobservable latent variable. Second, segmentation analyses identified mutually exclusive demographically or professionally based segments that were predictive of posterior class membership probabilities from the LC models. In the first-stage LC model, the frequency of particular responses was used to estimate model parameters with the expectation-maximization algorithm (Vermunt & Magidson 2002) such that the expected frequencies were as close as possible to observed frequencies (see Eid et al. [2003] for an overview of the methods). Heterogeneity of responses can be explored with a variety of tests and information criteria that identify the number of subsegments that result in the closest matches between expected and observed response patterns. Because there is no definitive test of best fit, it is common to use information criteria, which impose penalties on extra model parameters, to choose final models. I used Bayesian information criteria (BIC) to identify the model that was most parsimonious. The BIC test is more appropriate for relatively simple LC models and favors models with fewer classes than alternative criteria (e.g., Akaike information criteria), which facilitates model interpretation. LC models assume local independence between indicator variables. That is, responses on items are independent given class membership (Eid et al. 2003), which implies that LC structure explains all associations between items that are based on observable responses. I tested the local independence assumption with the bivariate residual Pearson χ2 statistic. A significant bivariate residual statistic (i.e., χ2 > 3.84, df = 1, p < 0.05) indicates the assumption of local independence is erroneous. When I found significant interactions between indicators, I sequentially deleted indicators with the highest number of significant bivariate residual statistics until all significant interactions were eliminated. Indicator variables not included in the LC cluster analysis were not needed to differentiate heterogeneity within the sample. I used Latent Gold software (Vermunt & Magidson 2005) to estimate all LC cluster models. In the second-stage model, I used chi-squared goodness-of-fit tests to identify significant predictors of LC membership patterns and merge predictor categories that did not differ in their prediction of the dependent variables (Magidson & Vermunt 2005). Covariates I tested as potential predictors were age; gender; region of residence; sector (academic or other); discipline (biological sciences or other); h index; and journal from which the respondent was drawn in the sample. I used the Chi-Squared Automatic Interaction Detection (CHAID) software (Magidson 2005) to systematically test all possible combinations of predictor variables and identify all those that were statistically significant. Respondents were unanimous (99.5%) in their view that it is likely a serious loss of biological diversity is underway at a global extent; 8.4%, 24.9%, and 66.2% thought that serious loss is likely, very likely, or virtually certain, respectively (Table 1). There was even greater consensus (79.1%) that human activities are virtually certainly accelerating the loss of biological diversity. By comparison, 61.9% and 55.1% thought climate change (presented as ""global warming"" in the survey to match language used by Rosenberg et al. [2010]) is a process that is already underway and that humans are accelerating it, respectively. This is consistent with results from Rosenberg et al. (2010), who found that in 2005, 61.6% and 49.2% of U.S. climate scientists strongly agreed that climate change was already underway and that human activities were accelerating climate change, respectively. The majority of respondents agreed (58.1%) or strongly agreed (14.6%) that the nature and causes of loss of biological diversity are highly understood (Supporting Information). Scientists agreed (35.5%) or strongly agreed (6.2%) that the consequences of the loss of biological diversity are highly understood. The 5-class LC cluster model minimized BIC and was chosen for further refinement. One bivariate residual was significant at the 5% level, indicating some redundancy between the 2 climate-change indicators. Dropping one statement (""Global warming is a process that is already underway."") from the model eliminated the significant bivariate residual. The final model (n= 582, 44 parameters, entropy R2= 0.78, classification error = 10.2%) cleaved the sample into five distinct clusters (Fig. 1): alarmed, concerned, science optimists, moderates, and science pessimists. All LC cluster analyses were conducted with data from only 582 of 583 respondents because I dropped one invalid response. Membership in latent-class clusters (y-axis) on the basis of scientists' understanding of loss of biological diversity (1, virtually impossible; 2, very unlikely; 3, unlikely; 4, about an even chance; 5, likely; 6, very likely; 7, virtually certain; SD, strongly disagree; D, disagree; N, neither agree nor disagree; A, agree; and SA, strongly agree; complete statements: indicator 1, A serious loss of biological diversity is underway at the global scale. 2, Human activities are accelerating the loss of biological diversity at the global scale. 3, Human activities are accelerating global warming. 4, Scientists have a strong understanding of the nature and causes of changes in biological diversity. 5, Scientists have a strong understanding of the consequences of changes in biological diversity.). Cluster 1, alarmed, contained 60.8% of the sample. Respondents in this cluster were very (8.9%) or virtually (91.9%) certain that a serious loss of biological diversity is underway and every respondent believed human activities are accelerating the loss. Those in cluster 2 (22.4% of the sample), concerned, expressed similar views as those in the alarmed cluster, but they were more measured in their views of the level of seriousness of biological diversity loss and human activities as drivers of that loss (and climate change). LC clusters 3 (7.0%, science optimists) and 5 (4.2%, science pessimists) held very similar views to each other on the seriousness of biological diversity loss, but they differed greatly on their views of scientists' understanding of the causes and effects of that loss. Cluster 4 (5.6%, moderates) respondents were more measured in all their responses. In the subsequent CHAID analysis, only publication in Conservation Biology explained significant variation (χ2= 10.94, df = 4, p= 0.03) in probability of membership in LC clusters (Supporting Information). Respondents who had published in Conservation Biology were more likely to belong to alarmed, science optimists, and science pessimists clusters. The common theme among these three clusters was that 100% of respondents viewed a serious loss of biological diversity as very likely or virtually certain. I asked respondents to provide only answers for regions and major ecosystem types with which they were familiar. I interpreted no response as do not know. For regions or ecosystems where respondents thought loss of biological diversity was very likely or virtually certain, I asked a follow-up question regarding the timing of loss. Respondents' agreement that serious biological diversity loss was very likely or virtually certain ranged from lows of 72.8% (27.0% very likely, 45.8% virtually certain) for Western Europe to highs of 90.9% (33.0% very likely, 57.9% virtually certain) for Southeast Asia (Supporting Information). The ecosystem respondents viewed as most seriously affected by loss of biological diversity was marine tropical coral; 38.7% and 49.3% believed that a serious loss of biological diversity in marine tropical coral is very likely or virtually certain, respectively (Supporting Information). Tropical moist and dry broadleaf forest and mangrove ecosystems were also viewed as subject to serious levels of loss (loss virtually certain = 47.4%, 44.6%, and 40.6%, respectively), whereas serious losses of biological diversity in marine upwelling ecosystems was viewed as virtually certain by 17.9% of respondents. Opinions on the timing of the most serious losses in biological diversity over and within the range of ecosystems were broad (Supporting Information). Generally, respondents thought serious losses of biological diversity in freshwater and temperate terrestrial ecosystems tended to occur more in the past relative to tropical and polar ecosystems. All 583 respondents completed 16 BWS ranking questions (Table 2). Mean scores, which represent likelihood of being chosen as the statement that respondents most agreed with, summed to 100. An item with a mean score of 6 was thus twice as likely to be chosen as that most agreed with by respondents as an item with a mean score of 3. The distribution of mean scores exhibited some discontinuity. The two statements with the highest rank had significantly higher levels of agreement (95% CI of 6.824–7.084 for ""Conservation planning needs to understand how people and nature interact in particular places."" and 6.275–6.633 for ""Biological diversity should be conserved because it sustains ecosystem function."") than the statement ranked third (95% CI of 5.041–5.434 for ""Conservation priorities should reflect the need to protect globally important species and ecosystems.""). Respondents were very unlikely to select the two statements with the lowest rank as ones they most agreed with (95% CI of 0.543–0.765 for ""The value of biological diversity depends on its usefulness to people."" and of 0.371–0.483 for ""Long-term residents should be displaced from protected areas if conservation needs warrant."" Other statements filled the gradient between the extremes (Supporting Information). The 17 statements about conservation interventions, triage, and the management of biological diversity were used in a LC analysis of respondents' conservation-strategy orientation. A 6-class LC cluster model minimized BIC. Twenty-one bivariate residuals were significant at the 5% level in the first model, indicating substantial local dependence among the conservation-strategy indicators. I sequentially deleted eight indicators (statements 3.2, 3.2, 1.4, 3.6, 3.1, 2.2, 2.4, and 3.4) to eliminate all significant bivariate residuals. The final model (n= 582 respondents, 86 parameters) was well supported by the data (entropy R2= 0.73, classification error = 14.3%). The classes (Fig. 2) were indicative of the diversity of opinions held by scientists on strategic approaches to conservation. The indicator variables dropped from the analysis are fully described in Supporting Information. Membership in latent-class clusters (y-axis) on the basis of scientists' level of agreement with potentially controversial conservation management strategies (cluster 6, protesters [n =3], not included) (SD, strongly disagree; D, disagree; N, neither agree nor disagree; A, agree; SA, strongly agree; full statements with which respondents were presented: 1.1, ""We should be helping species adapt by letting them stay natural and letting the processes go as they will as climate changes."" 1.2, ""Assisted migration interventions are doomed to failure. Our history of biological manipulation has not gone well and there is no reason to think that future manipulations will go better."" 1.3, ""Climate change is going to force our hand. We need to use assisted migration to move species that can't get around urban and agricultural barriers to places where they are going to be more likely to persist."" 1.5, ""We don't have the framework for tolerating loss. We have to figure out, for critical ecosystems to start with, what are the minimum number of species within functional groups that are essential for ecosystem services? We need to protect them even if we lose others."" 2.1, ""Inevitably one has to make some harsh decisions such as what you give up on. No doubt there will be species that we should and will give up on."" 2.3, ""We have spent tons of money trying to save some icon species. If we went purely from a triage perspective, we would have let those species go extinct. But if an icon species can attract extra money for conservation, it is not taking resources from other conservation programs. Triage could thus harm conservation efforts by limiting our capacity to raise money."" 2.5, ""We cannot justify major triage choices because we don't know the role of particular species in ecosystems."" 3.5, ""We need more rules, better monitoring, increased enforcement, and larger fines. Making damaging human behavior illegal and expensive is central to any strategy meant to protect biological diversity."" 3.7, ""Conserving biological diversity in an era of climate change means conservation professionals need to be willing to rethink conservation goals and standards of success.""). One cluster, mainstream moderates, composed 43.2% of the sample; respondents in this cluster tended to be relatively neutral on most statements. The distinguishing characteristics of a second naturally oriented cluster (32.0% of the sample) was respondents' relatively strong focus on helping species stay natural (indicator 1.1 [""We should be helping species adapt by letting them stay natural and letting the processes go as they will as climate changes.""]), pessimism regarding assisted migration (indicators 1.3 [""Climate change is going to force our hand. We need to use assisted migration to move species that can't get around urban and agricultural barriers to places where they are going to be more likely to persist.""] and 1.5 [""We don't have the framework for tolerating loss. We have to figure out, for critical ecosystems to start with, what are the minimum number of species within functional groups that are essential for ecosystem services? We need to protect them even if we lose others.""]), and unwillingness to protect some species at the expense of others (indicator 2.1 [""Inevitably one has to make some harsh decisions such as what you give up on. No doubt there will be species that we should and will give up on.""]). Respondents in this cluster were relatively neutral on triage issues. Respondents in the third cluster (13.2% of the sample), interventionists, were more supportive of direct conservation interventions. They strongly agreed that conservation goals needed rethinking (indicator 3.7 [""Conserving biological diversity in an era of climate change means that conservation professionals need to be willing to rethink conservation goals and standards of success.""]), that the use of triage should not be discounted because of a lack of ecological knowledge (indicator 2.5 [""We cannot justify major triage choices because we don't know the role of particular species in ecosystems.""]), and that conservation actions should not be taken for some species (indicator 2.1). Although they were supportive of assisted migration, they also expressed some pessimism about the probability of success of this strategy (indicators 1.2 [""Assisted migration interventions are doomed to failure. Our history of biological manipulation has not gone well and there is no reason to think that future manipulations will go better.""] and 1.5). Respondents in cluster 4, preservationists, did not agree with assisted migration (indicator 1.3), disagreed that some species should be protected at the expense of others (indicators 1.5 and 2.1), and were supportive of more regulation of human behavior (indicator 3.5 [""We need more rules, better monitoring, increased enforcement, and larger fines. Making damaging human behavior illegal and expensive is central to any strategy meant to protect biological diversity.""]). Respondents in cluster 5 (4.0% of the sample), conservationists, did not agree that some species should be protected at the expense of others (indicators 1.5 and 2.1), were supportive of assisted migration efforts (indicators 1.2 and 1.3), skeptical of triage (indicators 2.3 [""We have spent tons of money trying to save some icon species. If we went purely from a triage perspective, we would have let those species go extinct. But if an icon species can attract extra money for conservation, it is not taking resources from other conservation programs. Triage could thus harm conservation efforts by limiting our capacity to raise money.""] and 2.5), and were quite supportive of more conservation rules and their enforcement (indicator 3.5). Only three respondents were in cluster 6, protestors. They strongly disagreed with most statements and either did not pay attention to survey questions or were exhibiting protest responses because they did not like the questions. Their responses are not included in Fig. 2. Opinions regarding effective conservation strategies differed significantly (χ2= 23.25, df = 5, p= 0.01) among residents of the following 2 groups of countries or regions: (1) Africa, Asia, and Europe and (2) Australia, New Zealand, Pacific Islands, North America, Latin America, and Caribbean. Membership in the interventionist cluster was over 10% higher for scientists from the second group, whereas scientists from the first group were 6.8% more likely to be members of the preservationist cluster (Supporting Information).

",,,,"The presence of the golden bandicoot (Isoodon auratus) on Marchinbar Island off north-eastern Arhemland, Northern Territory, was confirmed by means of morphological features, hair characteristics and allozyme electrophoresis. Evidence of I. auratus was found at most points sampled along the 50-km length of Marchinbar Island. The species showed a strong habitat preference for low heath or shrubland on sand or sandstone, a combination that covers some 70% or 140 km2 of the island. No sign was found in the remaining forest/thicket or strand/Casuarina habitat. No major changes occurred in the distribution of the species between seasons, and individuals maintained overlapping home ranges of similar size, about 10-35 ha. Considerable variation occurred in the characteristics of sites used for daytime shelter, including rocky shelves, shrubs and Triodia hummocks. Different shelter sites were frequently occupied on consecutive days. Foraging sites were sparsely vegetated and diet consisted mainly of a broad range of invertebrates. It is likely that the rocky habitat of Marchinbar Island is sufficiently dissected to ensure the availability of suitable habitat without the necessity of a managed fire regime. The bandicoot population on Marchinbar Island has at least two terrestrial predators, wild dogs (Canis familiaris) and carpet pythons (Morelia spilota). The current predation pressure is not considered to threaten the existence of the bandicoots on the island; however, the addition of another predator species (e.g. the feral cat) may create unacceptable conditions.","1035-3712

",,,,"A recently-published review from 2021 presents a comprehensive checklist of ladybeetles of Portugal, including the Azores and Madeira Archipelagos. Until then, the available information was very scattered and based on a single revision dating back to 1986, a few international catalogues and databases, individual records and studies on communities of agroecosystems. However, no information was available on faunal composition across the Azorean islands and their habitats, using standardised inventories. Here, we present data about the biodiversity of ladybeetles and their distribution and abundance in five Islands of the Azores (Faial, Graciosa, Pico, São Jorge and São Miguel). Surveys included herbaceous and arboreal habitats from native to anthropogenic-managed habitats: ruderal road vegetation, vegetable garden, mixed forest of endemic and non-native host plants, coastal prairies, coastal mixed vegetation, cornfields and urban areas. We aimed to contribute to the ongoing effort to document the terrestrial biodiversity of Portugal, including the Archipelago of the Azores, within the research project AZORESBIOPORTAL–PORBIOTA (ACORES-01-0145-FEDER-000072). In this study, a total of 1,487 specimens of Coccinellidae belonging to 19 species are reported for several habitats. The listed species are from one single sub-familiy (Coccinellinae) and six tribes; Chilocorini (one species), Coccidulini (three species), Coccinellini (six species), Noviini (one species), Scymnini (seven species), Stethorini (one species). The number of species collected per island differed; Faial (10 species), Graciosa (four species), Pico (seven species), São Jorge (seven species) and São Miguel (12 species). For six species, new island records are given. Currently, the number of species known to occur in the Azores are 32, including two doubtful records. The majority of species are Scymnini, being Scymnus (Scymnus) interruptus (Goeze, 1777) and Scymnus (Scymnus) nubilus Mulsant, 1850, the most abundant species (relative abundance 71.1%). This database will be the baseline of a long-term monitoring project allowing assessment of the impact of ongoing global changes in the distribution and abundance of ladybeetles.

",,,,"The invertebrate terrestrial fauna of Antarctica is being investigated with increasing interest to discover how life interacts with the extreme polar environment and how millions of years of evolution have shaped their biodiversity. Classical taxonomic approaches, complemented by molecular tools, are improving our understanding of the systematic relationships of some species, changing the nomenclature of taxa and challenging the taxonomic status of others. The springtail Friesea grisea has previously been described as the only species with a ""pan-Antarctic"" distribution. However, recent genetic comparisons have pointed to another scenario. The latest morphological study has confined F. grisea to the sub-Antarctic island of South Georgia, from which it was originally described, and resurrected F. antarctica as a congeneric species occurring on the continental mainland. Molecular data demonstrate that populations of this taxon, ostensibly occurring across Maritime and Continental Antarctica, as well as on some offshore islands, are evolutionarily isolated and divergent and cannot be included within a single species. The present study, combining morphological with molecular data, attempts to validate this hypothesis and challenges the taxonomic status of F. antarctica, suggesting that two additional new species, described here as Friesea gretae sp. nov. and Friesea propria sp. nov., are present in Continental Antarctica.

",,,,"Despite being a dry country, historically, Cyprus had many wetlands, both freshwater and saline. However, pollution, mosquito management, increased use of water and drainage of wetland areas for agriculture and building, led to the loss of many of the original wetlands. On the other hand, persistent water shortages have led to the construction of more than 100 dams on the island. In this study, the biodiversity of two natural wetlands, Ronnas River and Oroklini Lake, was compared to that of two man-made wetlands, Geçitköy (Panagra) Reservoir and Achna Dam. Baseline ecological surveys of plants, invertebrates and birds were carried out at bi-monthly intervals from February to June 2006. In total, 495 plant species, out of which 22 were endemic, were recorded with Gecitkoy (Panagra) Dam showing the highest plant diversity and Oroklini Lake the lowest. A total of 13 invertebrate orders were recorded, however, no statistical difference was found between the number of orders in artificial and natural wetlands. Furthermore, 18 butterfly species were recorded, with the highest diversity found at Ronnas River on Centaurea sp., Onopordum cyprium, Pistachia sp. and Cistus creticus. Less diversity found at Oroklini Lake and Achna Dam was due to an absence of maquis vegetation in these areas. Moreover, the highest butterfly diversity in all wetlands was observed in February and April, following winter rainfall in February, and increasing temperatures in April. Lower insect numbers and diversity in May were due to windy conditions. A total of 83 bird species were identified, with 32 recorded at Ronnas River, 29 at Oroklini Lake, 25 at Geçitköy (Panagra) Reservoir and 35 at Achna Dam. Most individuals were counted at Achna Dam (1493) and the least at Ronnas River (217). At Oroklini, Geçitköy and Achna, the most abundant species was the Common Coot while most species recorded at Ronnas were terrestrial, with the Common Wood-pigeon being the most abundant species. However the outcome so far is that there is little difference between these two wetlands types in terms of biodiversity richness. This study has demonstrated that artificial wetlands do provide important habitats for flora and fauna and these sites should be managed with biodiversity as well as water resources.","0556-3321

",,,,"Abstract The archipelago of Svalbard in the European High Arctic lies on the convergence of the Palaearctic and Nearctic flora and fauna and contains elements of both regions. The island of Hopen is located in the south east of the archipelago within the path of the cold south−westerly flowing East Svalbard Current originating in the Arctic ocean and flowing along the north Russian coast. This current is postulated as a colonization route of the invertebrate fauna of Svalbard. Few reports of the terrestrial invertebrates of Hopen exist and none of the mite suborders Oribatida or Mesostigmata. With the taxonomic confusion existing in the inventories of this important region of the Arctic, new sampling campaigns with species identified by modern taxonomic principles and with material deposited in accessible museums and collections are essential. Identified mites included six species of oribatid mites with Diapterobates notatus dominating, and five species of Mesostigmata with Zercon forsslundi forming the dominant species. None of the species collected was a new record for Svalbard and all have wide circumpolar, Palaearctic or Holarctic distributions. Dispersal to Svalbard from northern Russia is hence neither supported nor rejected. The expected oribatid and mesostigmatid diversity of the island is greater than observed from the limited sampling described here.

",,,,"Aim The most popular sources of information on species distributions are the expert‐derived maps and georeferenced occurrences, mainly those compiled by the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF). These sources have been constantly used with biogeographical and conservation goals. However, their degree of accuracy in representing geographical biodiversity patterns remains poorly understood. Here, we compared both sources of information on species distributions to estimate global patterns of richness and species composition of threatened vertebrates on marine islands. Location Global. Taxon Terrestrial vertebrates. Methods We gathered distributional data of all threatened terrestrial vertebrate species inhabiting 22,471 marine islands worldwide from GBIF and expert derived maps. Then, to assess strengths and biases from each source, using geographical information systems, we calculated and compared: (a) species richness per island, (b) general patterns of richness and (c) the number of shared species from both sources per island. Results There were dramatic differences between the information derived from both data sources. The species richness estimated with expert‐derived maps resulted in 10 more species per island, on average, than the estimations obtained from GBIF data. The mean proportion of shared species per island (between both data sources) was very low (3.1% of the species), and the general patterns of richness were markedly different. The most significant differences occurred in tropical areas and Europe. Conclusion Differences between the two sources emerged from intrinsic biases: expert‐derived maps tend to overestimate species' counts, whereas GBIF occurrences tend to do the opposite, except for some well‐sampled regions where both data types converge. Our findings suggest that previous global assessments performed with these information sources on species distributions, especially those focusing on protected areas, should be carefully considered.","0305-0270

",,,,"Abstract Background Resident soil microbiota play key roles in sustaining the core ecosystem processes of terrestrial Antarctica, often involving unique taxa with novel functional traits. However, the full scope of biodiversity and the niche-neutral processes underlying these communities remain unclear. In this study, we combine multivariate analyses, co-occurrence networks and fitted species abundance distributions on an extensive set of bacterial, micro-eukaryote and archaeal amplicon sequencing data to unravel soil microbiome patterns of nine sites across two east Antarctic regions, the Vestfold Hills and Windmill Islands. To our knowledge, this is the first microbial biodiversity report on the hyperarid Vestfold Hills soil environment. Results Our findings reveal distinct regional differences in phylogenetic composition, abundance and richness amongst microbial taxa. Actinobacteria dominated soils in both regions, yet Bacteroidetes were more abundant in the Vestfold Hills compared to the Windmill Islands, which contained a high abundance of novel phyla. However, intra-region comparisons demonstrate greater homogeneity of soil microbial communities and measured environmental parameters between sites at the Vestfold Hills. Community richness is largely driven by a variable suite of parameters but robust associations between co-existing members highlight potential interactions and sharing of niche space by diverse taxa from all three microbial domains of life examined. Overall, non-neutral processes appear to structure the polar soil microbiomes studied here, with niche partitioning being particularly strong for bacterial communities at the Windmill Islands. Eukaryotic and archaeal communities reveal weaker niche-driven signatures accompanied by multimodality, suggesting the emergence of neutrality. Conclusion We provide new information on assemblage patterns, environmental drivers and non-random occurrences for Antarctic soil microbiomes, particularly the Vestfold Hills, where basic diversity, ecology and life history strategies of resident microbiota are largely unknown. Greater understanding of these basic ecological concepts is a pivotal step towards effective conservation management.

",,,,"Several important habitats have become threatened in the last few centuries in the Mediterranean Basin due to major changes adopted in land-use practices. The consequent loss of natural and seminatural orchid habitats leads to the appreciation of small anthropogenic habitats, such as cemeteries and roadside verges. Colonization of cemeteries and roadside verges by orchids has long been known, but no study to date compared the suitability of these two anthropogenic habitats for orchids. Therefore, in this paper our aim was to survey cemeteries and roadside verges and to compare these two habitats regarding their role in conserving Mediterranean terrestrial orchids. We conducted field surveys in three Mediterranean islands, Cyprus, Crete, and Lesbos, where both cemeteries and roadside verges were sampled on a geographically representative scale. We found a total of almost 7,000 orchid individuals, belonging to 77 species in the two anthropogenic habitat types. Roadside verges hosted significantly more individuals than cemeteries in Crete and Lesbos, and significantly more species across all three islands. Our results suggest that although cemeteries have a great potential conservation value in other parts of the world, intensive maintenance practices that characterized cemeteries in these three islands renders them unable to sustain valuable plant communities. On the other hand, roadside verges play a prominent role in the conservation of Mediterranean orchids in Cyprus and Greece. The pioneer status of roadside verges facilitates their fast colonization, while roads serve as ecological corridors in fragmented landscapes.

Deploying fixed wing unoccupied aerial systems (UAS) for coastal morphology assessment and management.Accurate measurement of the morphology and distribution of coastal habitats is critical for understanding the function of coastal environments, assessing the resilience of coastal communities, and managing the coastal zone effectively. Unoccupied aerial systems (UASs, also known as unmanned aerial vehicles) and structure from motion (SfM) photogrammetry may be optimal for coastal surveys around small- or medium-sized municipalities, but guidance is needed to identify appropriate equipment configurations. Digital surface models (DSMs) from UAS equipped with mapping and survey-grade GPS units were processed with and without ground control point (GCP) correction, and their accuracy was compared to terrestrial laser scanner (TLS) derived DSMs and global navigation satellite system (GNSS) checkpoints. Four UAS sorties were flown over an active fetch-limited barrier island in North Carolina, which was concurrently surveyed with TLS and GNSS. Average DSM vertical accuracy from real-time kinematic (RTK)-equipped UAS improved from 0.081 m error to 0.032 m error after GCP correction, and the average elevation range between surfaces improved from ∼0.17 m to ∼0.05 m. In areas with low dunes, the UAS DSM was an average of 0.042 m away from the TLS DSM and was closer to the GNSS survey checkpoints. In vegetated areas, this distance increased to 0.082 m because of TLS occlusion effects. The SfM process-generated elevation artifacts in areas of imagery with homogenous texture, such as the foreshore and sun angle, likely plays an important role when surveying sandy beach environments. The RTK-equipped UAS and UAS data processed with GCPs yield DMSs with similar accuracy to those derived from TLS but are a superior choice for municipal-scale surveys because of lower operating costs, greater areal coverage, and lower environmental impact.

",,,,"Abstract Aim The conservation of biodiversity is hampered by data deficiencies, with many new species and subspecies awaiting description or reclassification. Population genomics and ecological niche modelling offer complementary new tools for uncovering functional units of phylogenetic diversity. We hypothesize that phylogenetically delineated lineages of gentoo penguins ( Pygoscelis papua ) distributed across Antarctica and sub‐Antarctic Islands are subject to spatially explicit ecological conditions that have limited gene flow, facilitating genetic differentiation, and thereby speciation processes. Location Antarctica and sub‐Antarctic area. Methods We identify divergent lineages for gentoo penguins using ddRAD‐seq and mtDNA, and generated species distribution models (SDMs) based on terrestrial and marine parameters . Results Analyses of our genomic data supports the existence of four major lineages of gentoo penguin: (i) spanning the sub‐Antarctic archipelagos north of the Antarctic Polar Front (APF); (ii) Kerguelen Island; (iii) South America; and (iv) across maritime Antarctic and the Scotia Arc archipelagos. The APF, a major current system around Antarctica, acts as the most important barrier separating regional sister lineages. Our ecological analyses spanning both the terrestrial (breeding sites) and marine (feeding sites) realms recover limited niche overlap among the major lineages of gentoo penguin. We observe this pattern to correspond more closely with regional differentiation of marine conditions than to terrestrial macroenvironmental features. Main conclusions Recognition of regional genetic lineages as discrete evolutionary entities that occupy distinct ecological niches and also differ morphologically should be considered a priority for conservation. Gentoo penguins provide a good example of how conservation policy can be directly impacted by new insights obtained through the integration of larger genomic datasets with novel approaches to ecological modelling. This is particularly pertinent to polar environments that are among the most rapidly changing environments on earth.

",,,,"Terrestrial isopods are a well-studied invertebrate taxon in Sicily and in the surrounding islands (Maltese archipelago included). During the last 30 years their systematics, ecology and biogeography have been analysed by many authors. The size and the diverse geological origin of the Sicilian archipelago represents an ideal open laboratory in which to study some biogeographical patterns, such as the species-area relationship (SAR). Since many species show limited adaptation to broad physiological conditions and low mobility, and, therefore, their active dispersion is very slow, SAR can be a useful means to examine biogeographical patterns of isopods. Here we analyse their biogeography and whether there is a relationship between the area and the habitat variability of the island surveyed, and whether these factors have an either direct or coupled influence on species richness and ecology. Moreover, we evaluate a potential relationship between Isopoda species richness and the distance from the centre of dispersion (Sicily). Finally, we test for a difference in species and habitat richness between volcanic and non-volcanic islands. Our results show a positive correlation between the area and the habitat, more significant than that between the area and the species, leading us to speculate that habitat diversity has an influence on the SAR of isopods. We find a significantly higher richness of both species and habitats on non-volcanic islands. Finally, our analysis confutes the hypothesis that the number of isopod species on the archipelago's islets declines with the distance from Sicily. We suggest some potential explanations.

",,"Wiley
",,,,"Located hundreds of kilometres offshore of continental mainland Asia, the extremely high level of land vertebrate endemism in the East Asian Island Arc provides an excellent opportunity to test hypotheses regarding biogeographic processes and speciation. In this study, we aim to test alternative explanations for lineage diversification (vicariance versus dispersal models), and further develop a temporal framework for diversification in our focal taxon, which is consistent with the known age of these islands. We achieve these tests by investigating the historical biogeography of the Okinawa tree lizard (Japalura polygonata), one of the few widely-distributed reptiles across this archipelago.

Location
The East Asian Island Arc: (1) Central Ryukyu (Amami and Okinawa groups); (2) Southern Ryukyu (Miyako and Yaeyama groups); (3) Taiwan and adjacent islands.

Methods
A total of 246 tissues were sampled from 10 localities in the Ryukyu archipelago and 17 localities in Taiwan, covering the entire distributional range of this species, including all subspecies. DNA sequences of the mitochondrial cytochrome b, 16S ribosomal RNA, nuclear BACH-1 and RAG-1 genes (total: 4,684 bp) were obtained from these samples. We used maximum likelihood and Bayesian methods to infer phylogeny and divergence time, and used a model-fitting method of biogeographical inference to estimate ancestral range evolution.

Results
Multiple lines of evidence combine to identify a general pattern of dispersal-mediated diversification northward through the archipelago, following initial dispersal from Taiwan. These included (1) a phylogenetic estimate, revealing a sequential, south-to-north branching pattern; (2) ancestral range estimation, inferring multiple overseas dispersals and subsequent colonization of new landmasses; and (3) a reduction in genetic variation observed in successively-diverging lineages, decreasing from Taiwan northward, towards more remote islands. These results provide strong statistical support for an interpretation of successive bouts of dispersal via the powerful, well-documented, south-to-north Kuroshio Current. Estimation of divergence times suggests that most clades in southern Ryukyu and Taiwan diverged early, giving rise to lineages that have remained isolated, and that more recently-diverged lineages then colonized northward to subsequently occupy the landmasses of the Central Ryukyu archipelago.

Main conclusions
Our general inference of biogeographic history in Japalura polygonata suggested that this species originated on Taiwan and the Yaeyama group, and arrived at its current distribution in Miyako, Okinawa, Toku and Amami islands by a series of stepping-stone dispersals, which we report for the first time for a terrestrial vertebrate endemic to this region.","0305-0270

",,,,"Bees are key pollinators in almost all terrestrial ecosystems and can have major roles in agricultural production. Records of bees in the Southwest Pacific indicate a very low diversity, with the Fijian bee fauna one of the least diverse, despite an otherwise rich biota. Megachilid bees represent a large proportion of the bee fauna for almost all island groups in the Southwest Pacific and, because they are wood- and stem-nesting, their wide distribution is likely to have been influenced by rafting and anthropogenic maritime trade. Our study is the first to apply molecular techniques to the study of megachilid bees in this region and indicates between four and five recent introductions to Fiji, likely from Southeast Asia. The study also provides the first record of Heriades (Michenerella) in the Southwest Pacific and the first record of the subgenus Megachile (Callomegachile) in Fiji. These results indicate that a large proportion of the Fijian bee fauna is likely to have been introduced only very recently and, therefore, has had only a very recent role in Fijian ecosystems, despite their current abundance. This has very wide implications for understanding Fijian plant-pollinator relationships.

",,,,"Mosses are dominant components of high-latitude environments, and Signy Island (maritime Antarctic) provides a representative example of polar cryptogam-dominated terrestrial ecosystems. In 2011, we mapped all moss banks, their characteristics (thickness, area, floristic composition) and investigated their relationship with selected environmental factors including topography (elevation, slope, aspect), biotic disturbance (fur seals), deglaciation age of the surfaces, location on the eastern vs. western side of the island and snow cover as a proxy of water supply during the summer (December). We here identify the most important environmental factors influencing moss bank characteristics and distribution and provide a baseline for future monitoring. Moss bank abundance and distribution are the result of the interaction of multiple abiotic and biotic factors acting at different spatial scales. The most important factors are the location of moss banks on the eastern vs. western side of the island at the macroscale (with thicker and larger moss banks and a prevalence of Chorisodontium aciphyllum on the western side) and their favourable aspect (mainly N, NW) at the microscale, providing better microclimatic conditions suitable for their development. The elevation threshold detected at 120 m could indicate the occurrence of a 'moss bank line', analogous to the tree line, and corresponds with a threshold of mean annual temperature of −4.8 °C. The other factors examined play a subsidiary role in affecting bank distribution and characteristics. These findings allow a better understanding of this key feature of maritime Antarctic vegetation and provide quantitative information about their ecology.

",,,,"Abstract Species distributions are dependent on interactions with abiotic and biotic factors in the environment. Abiotic factors like temperature, moisture, and soil nutrients, along with biotic interactions within and between species, can all have strong influences on spatial distributions of plants and animals. Terrestrial Antarctic habitats are relatively simple and thus good systems to study ecological factors that drive species distributions and abundance. However, these environments are also sensitive to perturbation, and thus understanding the ecological drivers of species distribution is critical for predicting responses to environmental change. The Antarctic midge, Belgica antarctica , is the only endemic insect on the continent and has a patchy distribution along the Antarctic Peninsula. While its life history and physiology are well studied, factors that underlie variation in population density within its range are unknown. Previous work on Antarctic microfauna indicates that distribution over broad scales is primarily regulated by soil moisture, nitrogen content, and the presence of suitable plant life, but whether these patterns are true over smaller spatial scales has not been investigated. Here we sampled midges across five islands on the Antarctic Peninsula and tested a series of hypotheses to determine the relative influences of abiotic and biotic factors on midge abundance. While historical literature suggests that Antarctic organisms are limited by the abiotic environment, our best-supported hypothesis indicated that abundance is predicted by a combination of abiotic and biotic conditions. Our results are consistent with a growing body of literature that biotic interactions are more important in Antarctic ecosystems than historically appreciated.

This exceptional diversity led early systematists to place the species into several genera with cosmopolitan distributions. It has been recently suggested that these species compose a single large adaptive radiation. Species-area relationships for all thomisid species and for Misumenops F.O. Pickard-Cambridge 1900 (Thomisidae) species for various island areas were generated. Further, a phylogenetic hypothesis was constructed based on genetic distances between the Hawaiian thomisids and various outgroups using a 450 bp region of the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase I (COI) gene to test for close genetic relationships. Despite the extraordinary isolation of the Hawaiian islands, the numbers of Misumenops and total thomisid species were found to be significantly higher than predicted for an island system of its size. Phylogenetic analysis of COI suggests the Hawaiian thomisids are more closely related to each other than to representatives of genera to which they have been previously assigned. These results support the existence of a Hawaiian thomisid adaptive radiation, and merit further investigation using comparative methods.","0161-8202

",,,,"Despite increasing scientific interest in the Indo-Australian Archipelago (IAA), this geographically complex region, hosting an outstanding level of marine and terrestrial biodiversity, remains only partly understood biogeographically. We present an updated and resolved phylogenetic tree for the woody genus Aglaia, and we investigate the origin and dispersal history of Aglaia.

Location
Australasia, Indo-Australian Archipelago, Indomalesia, Pacific islands.

Methods
Sequence data from the nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacers (ITS) were used to reconstruct the phylogenetic relationships of 182 taxa. The phylogeny was then used in combination with fossil data and secondary calibration information to estimate divergence times using a relaxed molecular clock approach. Biogeographical scenarios and potential ancestral areas were investigated using statistical dispersal–vicariance analysis (S-DIVA) and the dispersal–extinction–cladogenesis (DEC) method.

Results
Our study showed that the crown group of Aglaia dates back to the Oligocene/Miocene boundary (c. 23.0 Ma), with major divergence events beginning in the middle Miocene (c. 13.8 Ma). Sundaland was confirmed as the area of origin of modern Aglaia. The results further provided evidence that dispersal routes existed between the Sunda Shelf and Wallacea and further east to the Pacific islands, crossing both Wallace's and Lydekker's lines.

Main conclusions
The directionality of dispersal events to or across Wallacea was predominantly eastwards, following the expansion of wet tropical forest across Wallace's Line and beyond. However, several reversal dispersal events occurred as well. During the Pleistocene (0.1–2.6 Ma) there were long-distance dispersal events from the western Pacific islands back to Sundaland or the Philippines, which might have been facilitated by birds. In summary, our study confirms that Aglaia had a Sundanian origin and started to disperse eastwards during the Miocene (5.3–23.0 Ma), with limited dispersal across Lydekker's Line. The comparison of the age of clades with the proposed age of their areas of distribution based on independent geological evidence showed good temporal agreement.","0305-0270

Boeckella is a calanoid copepod genus distributed mainly in the Southern Hemisphere, with 14 species reported at higher southern latitudes in South America and Antarctica. We present an updated database of these 14 species of Boeckella generated from a combination of three sources: 1) new field sampling data, 2) published records, and 3) Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF), to provide a comprehensive description of the geographic distribution of the genus south of latitude 40°S in southern South America and the three main terrestrial biogeographic regions of Antarctica. The database includes 380 records, 62 from field sampling, 278 from the literature and 40 from GBIF. Southern South America, including the Falkland/Malvinas Islands, had the highest species richness and number of records (14 and 297, respectively), followed by the sub-Antarctic islands (5 and 34), South Orkney Islands (2 and 14), South Shetland Islands (1 and 23), Antarctic Peninsula (1 and 10) and finally continental Antarctica (1 and 2). Boeckellapoppei Mrázek, 1901 is the only representative of the genus, and more widely the only terrestrial/freshwater invertebrate, currently reported from all three main biogeographic regions in Antarctica (sub-Antarctic islands, maritime and continental Antarctic). Future development of molecular systematic studies in this group should contribute to assessing the correspondence between morphological taxonomy and molecular evolutionary radiation.

Four of these are supralittoral wrack generalists: Platorchestia monodi BOLD:AAB3402, (a unique Molecular Operational Taxonomic Unit according to the Barcode Index Number system), a related species recognized by molecular methods, Platorchestia platensis BOLD:AAA2949, Mexorchestia carpenteri carpenteri BOLD:AAC1491 and Tethorchestia antillensis; and one a terrestrial leaf-litter generalist: Talitroides alluaudi. A key is provided to discriminate between the formally described talitrids of Bermuda. Dispersal mechanisms from the American continent to Bermuda were considered for all taxa based on species distributions along the North American Atlantic coast and also investigated by molecular methods, using genetic population differentiation and haplotype network analysis based on the barcode region of cytochrome c oxidase subunit I gene. For P. monodi BOLD:AAB3402 the genetic results suggest that some dispersal events occurred before human colonization of Bermuda but are equivocal about the source population and therefore the direction of dispersal. Some very recent synanthropic dispersal is possible with this species. For the other two species studied genetically, P. platensis BOLD:AAA2949 and M. c. carpenteri BOLD:AAC1491, the small population samples analysed support dispersal to Bermuda from the American mainland, before human occupation of Bermuda, although the available sample size was limited for these species. The available limited direct, non-genetic evidence supports synanthropic transport for Talitroides alluaudi. Platorchestia monodi BOLD:AAB3402 is found in the same wrack habitat as P. platensis BOLD:AAA2949 on Bermuda, apparently without interbreeding. No evidence was found that driftwood specialist talitrids had become established in Bermuda.

Iguanid lizards and boine snakes are ancient Gondwanan lineages whose distribution has been demonstrated to have been influenced by continental drift. Their enigmatic presence on the islands of the Pacific, however, has drawn fantastical conclusions of more than 8,000‐km rafting from the Americas. We reexamine the hypothesis of dispersal in light of new molecular data and divergence time estimates. Our results suggest an early Paleogene (50–60 million years) divergence of these groups and the plausibility of an Asiatic or Australian (over land) source. Because the subfossil record indicates that iguanas (but not snakes) were a primary food source of island inhabitants, the absence of these species from islands with a longer history of human presence is unsurprising. Together these findings are taken as evidence of the influence humans have had on these taxa and are put forth as an example of anthropogenic obfuscation of biogeographic history.

",,,,"Abstract The potential for biological colonization of Antarctic shores is an increasingly important topic in the context of anthropogenic warming. Successful Antarctic invasions to date have been recorded exclusively from terrestrial habitats. While non‐native marine species such as crabs, mussels and tunicates have already been reported from Antarctic coasts, none have as yet established there. Among the potential marine invaders of Antarctic shallow waters is Halicarcinus planatus (Fabricius, 1775), a crab with a circum‐Subantarctic distribution and substantial larval dispersal capacity. An ovigerous female of this species was found in shallow waters of Deception Island, South Shetland Islands in 2010. A combination of physiological experiments and ecological modelling was used to assess the potential niche of H . planatus and estimate its future southward boundaries under climate change scenarios. We show that H . planatus has a minimum thermal limit of 1°C, and that its current distribution (assessed by sampling and niche modelling) is physiologically restricted to the Subantarctic region. While this species is presently unable to survive in Antarctica, future warming under both ‘strong mitigation’ and ‘no mitigation’ greenhouse gas emission scenarios will favour its niche expansion to the Western Antarctic Peninsula (WAP) by 2100. Future human activity also has potential to increase the probability of anthropogenic translocation of this species into Antarctic ecosystems.

",,,,"Cayman Brac (Cayman Islands) lies within the Caribbean Islands Biodiversity Hotspot, an epicenter of high biodiversity and endemism. However, all endemic terrestrial mammals on the Cayman Islands are now extinct, following post-1500 AD human colonization of the islands. Introduced rodents and domesticated mammals now exclusively represent this facet of terrestrial fauna on the Cayman Islands, and are a likely cause of endemic species loss on the islands. Cayman Brac has numerous caves and rock fissures that offer protection to a naturally accumulated ensemble of vertebrate sub-fossil bone remains, documenting modifications in island biodiversity through the Holocene. In this study, we showcase the first molecular faunal survey undertaken on sub-fossil remains from the Cayman Islands, using collagen fingerprinting for taxonomic identification of the cave skeletal deposits collected from a single cave system, Green Cave on Cayman Brac. Collagen type (I) extracts from 485 bone fragments were analyzed to determine faunal identity and assemblage composition. A total of 76% of the collagen fingerprint-yielding samples were mammalian in origin, 67% of which were identified as invasive murid rodents. Here, we present mass spectral biomarkers for the endemic terrestrial mammal fauna of Cayman Brac, including the extinct capromyid rodents, Capromys and Geocapromys (Rodentia: Capromyidae), alongside commentary on the composition of the sub-fossil bone assemblage between the five distinct depositional chambers that comprise Green Cave. Collagen (I) provides a key service in taxonomic identification and mapping of macroevolutionary trends, and these results suggest a pivotal role for murid rodents in the competition and extinction of terrestrial endemic mammals from the Cayman Islands.

",,,,"Allozyme electrophoresis was used to assess genetic variability and differentiation in 22 populations of Gressittacantha terranova Wise (Hexapoda, Collembola) from a coastal area of Victoria Land between the Mariner Glacier and the Nansen Ice Sheet. Allelic frequencies were determined at five enzyme loci: Phi, Pgm, Hk, Mpi and Mdh. Levels of variability, estimated as rates of heterozygosity, were higher than those calculated for the same loci in taxonomically related and non-related species of non-Antarctic Collembola. Thus, in spite of the ecological simplicity of Antarctic terrestrial ecosystems, G. terranova is characterized by high levels of genetic variability, and the 22 populations could be divided into three geogaphic groups, separated by the Aviator and Campbell glaciers. Genetic differentaton reflects the geographic arrangement of the populations, suggesting that the glaciers are effective barriers to gene flow, and that the patchy distribution of collembolan species in Antarctica has the potential to induce, in the long term, microspeciation processes. Interestingly, detectable genetic differentiation was observed between six populations collected at Edmonson Point, even though these are very close to each other, indicating the impact of geographic isolation even within short distances.

Prevention of its dispersal through Guam's cargo traffic to other Pacific islands has become a high environmental priority. Trapping around ports and other cargo staging areas is central to an integrated pest management programme designed to deter dispersal of the species. In this study, perimeter trapping of forested plots characteristic of those found in port areas was found to be the most effective trap placement strategy, although trap lines cut through the plot interior or placed along a single plot boundary were also effective. Snake removal potentially can be modelled using an exponential decay over time, providing the manager with a planning tool. Population recovery of Brown Tree Snakes in trapped plots was found to be slow in the fragmented forested habitats found around ports.

",,,,"Abstract. Integrated studies on the interplay between soils, periglacial geomorphology and plant communities are crucial for the understanding of climate change effects on terrestrial ecosystems of maritime Antarctica, one of the most sensitive areas to global warming. Knowledge on physical environmental factors that influence plant communities can greatly benefit studies on the monitoring of climate change in maritime Antarctica, where new ice-free areas are being constantly exposed, allowing plant growth and organic carbon inputs. The relationship between topography, plant communities and soils was investigated on Potter Peninsula, King George Island, maritime Antarctica. We mapped the occurrence and distribution of plant communities and identified soil–landform–vegetation relationships. The vegetation map was obtained by classification of a QuickBird image, coupled with detailed landform and characterization of 18 soil profiles. The sub-formations were identified and classified, and we also determined the total elemental composition of lichens, mosses and grasses. Plant communities on Potter Peninsula occupy 23% of the ice-free area, at different landscape positions, showing decreasing diversity and biomass from the coastal zone to inland areas where sub-desert conditions prevail. There is a clear dependency between landform and vegetated soils. Soils that have greater moisture or are poorly drained, and with acid to neutral pH, are favourable for moss sub-formations. Saline, organic-matter-rich ornithogenic soils of former penguin rookeries have greater biomass and diversity, with mixed associations of mosses and grasses, while stable felsenmeers and flat rocky cryoplanation surfaces are the preferred sites for Usnea and Himantormia lugubris lichens at the highest surface. Lichens sub-formations cover the largest vegetated area, showing varying associations with mosses.

",,,,"Abstract The endemic New Zealand frog framily Leiopelmatidae has three living species, all with very restricted distributions, and three extinct species, whose former natural history is unknown. The subfossil distributions of the extant Leiopelma hochstetteri Fitzinger 1861, and L. hamiltoni McCulloch 1919, show that until the late Holocene these species ranged from Punakaiki, on the west coast of the South Island, to Waitomo in the North Island. The morphological characters of the frogs, and the characteristics of the subfossil sites, suggest that the presumably extinct L. waitomoensis Worthy 1987 was a strongly hopping, stream or streamside frog, whereas L. markhami Worthy 1987, a slightly smaller extinct species, was primarily a walking, terrestrial frog. The formerly widespread species of Leiopelma, (L. markhami, L. waitomoensis, L. hochstetterz, and L. hamiltom all tended to become larger in southern populations. Size appears to be negatively correlated with temperature. The distribution of body sizes among adults of the extant Maud Island population of L. hamiltoni is similar to that of the extinct population of the same species previously living at Karamea, northwest Nelson. The disappearance of the extinct species, and the decline in range of the surviving species, date to the last millenium and is probably correlated with the arrival of the kiore, Rattus exulans, in New Zealand.

",,"Wiley
",,,,"Summary Invasive predators can dramatically alter ecosystems through both direct predation and indirect effects such as tropic cascades. However, most examples of top‐down effects of invasive predators in terrestrial systems stem from islands or similar low‐diversity ecosystems. Snakes are an emerging guild of damaging invasive predators, but demonstration of ecosystem‐level impacts of invasive snakes are limited to the single case of the brown treesnake on Guam. Invasive Burmese pythons are firmly established in southern Florida and have been linked to severe (80–100%) declines of several previously common mammal species (e.g. raccoons, opossums and rabbits). Specifically, spatiotemporal patterns of mammal declines in the Everglades mirror the spread of pythons and experimental reintroductions of rabbits to areas where they had been extirpated failed due to high (77% of mortalities) rates of predation by pythons. I evaluated the potential indirect effects of pythons on the nesting success of oviparous species by monitoring artificial turtle nests ( N = 183) at 13 sites across the expanding range of the python population. I documented few mammals and low rates of nest predation (average score = 1·5 on a 1–5 scale) in the southern Everglades where pythons have been established the longest, intermediate (average score = 2·3) rates of nest predation at recently invaded sites, and very high (average score = 4·6) rates of nest predation at sites with few or no pythons. These findings represent the first documentation of potential indirect effects of pythons on non‐prey species, and suggest that loss or decline of mammals is resulting in trophic cascades that threaten the Everglades ecosystem. Synthesis and applications . My results suggest that an introduction of non‐native apex predators can result in trophic cascades that alter even complex, continental ecosystems. The Burmese python invasion of South Florida shows remarkable parallels with the catastrophic case of the brown treesnake in Guam, but in some ways is even more worrisome. Documentation of both strong direct impacts on prey and potential indirect effects on Everglades’ ecosystems within 15 years after being recognized as established emphasizes the need to integrate python management into restoration of the Greater Everglades Ecosystem. More broadly, non‐native snakes warrant significant attention for their potential to become damaging invasive species.

",,"Wiley
",,,,"Aim
The rich flora of the Caribbean islands and surrounding mainland evolved in a context of isolation alternated with phases of terrestrial connectivity between landmasses, climatic fluctuations and episodes of mass extinctions during the Cenozoic. We explored how these events affected the evolution of the sister palm tribes Cryosophileae and Sabaleae, and how continent-island exchanges, endemic radiations and mass extinction shaped their extant diversity.

Location
The American continent including the Caribbean region.

Methods
We reconstructed a time-calibrated phylogeny of the palm tribes Cryosophileae and Sabaleae using 84% of the known species. We inferred ancestral distribution and tested the effect of island colonization and mass extinction on extant diversity.

Results
Our results indicate that Cryosophileae and Sabaleae originated c. 77 Ma most probably in Laurasia, and their extant species started to diversify between 56–35 Ma and 19–10 Ma respectively. Biogeographical state reconstruction estimated that Cryosophileae dispersed to South America between 56–35 Ma, then dispersed to North-Central America between 39–25 Ma and the Caribbean islands between 34–21 Ma. We detected a possible signature of a mass extinction event at the end of the Eocene, affecting the diversification of Cryosophileae and Sabaleae and we did not detect a diversification rate shift related to the colonization of the Caribbean islands.

Main conclusions
Species of Cryosophileae in the Caribbean islands are probably derived from a single Oligocene dispersal event that likely occurred overwater from North-Central America rather than through the hypothesized GAARlandia land bridge. Contrastingly, three independent Miocene dispersal events from North-Central America explain the occurrence of Sabaleae in the Caribbean islands. Contrary to our expectations, island colonization did not trigger increased diversification. Instead, we find that diversification patterns in this clade, and its disappearance from northernmost latitudes, could be the signature of a mass extinction triggered by the global temperature decline at the end of the Eocene.","0305-0270

",,,,"The South Sandwich Islands are a relatively pristine volcanic archipelago in the Southern Ocean that experience high levels of natural disturbance. The archipelago spans the biological transition between the sub-Antarctic and maritime Antarctic. They host the southern boundary for some sub-Antarctic communities and the northern boundary for some maritime Antarctic communities. Vertebrate communities are dominated by Chinstrap and Macaroni penguins in the north and Adélie penguins in the south. Terrestrial plant and animal communities are less well differentiated; their distribution more influenced by the distribution of geothermally-warmed ground. We review current biodiversity knowledge, the influence of contemporary change on the archipelago, and their regional importance to Southern Ocean species. We pose questions on how to manage the islands in the contexts of climate change, fishing and human visitation. Climate change and fisheries will likely impact on the islands’ biota, but we conclude that introduced species pose the largest threat to biodiversity. Given the ephemeral nature of populations across all trophic levels, we suggest that the islands be managed as one unit rather than individually and we recommend practical changes to permitting and to increase the no-take zone in the existing Marine Protected Area to protect penguin foraging areas.

",,,,"Endotoxins from Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) produced in transgenic pest-resistant Bt crops are generally not toxic to predatory and parasitic arthropods. However, elimination of Bt-susceptible prey and hosts in Bt crops could reduce predator and parasitoid abundance and thereby disrupt biological control of other herbivorous pests. Here we report results of a field study evaluating the effects of Bt sprays on non-target terrestrial herbivore and natural enemy assemblages from three rice (Oryza sativa L.) fields on Luzon Island, Philippines. Because of restrictions on field-testing of transgenic rice, Bt sprays were used to remove foliage-feeding lepidopteran larvae that would be targeted by Bt rice. Data from a 546-taxa Philippines-wide food web, matched abundance plots, species accumulation curves, time-series analysis, and ecostatistical tests for species richness and ranked abundance were used to compare different subsets of non-target herbivores, predators, and parasitoids in Bt sprayed and water-sprayed (control) plots. For whole communities of terrestrial predators and parasitoids, Bt sprays altered parasitoid richness in 3 of 3 sites and predator richness in 1 of 3 sites, as measured by rarefaction (in half of these cases, richness was greater in Bt plots), while Spearman tests on ranked abundances showed that correlations, although significantly positive between all treatment pairs, were stronger for predators than for parasitoids, suggesting that parasitoid complexes may have been more sensitive than predators to the effects of Bt sprays. Species accumulation curves and time-series analyses of population trends revealed no evidence that Bt sprays altered the overall buildup of predator or parasitoid communities or population trajectories of non-target herbivores (planthoppers and leafhoppers) nor was evidence found for bottom-up effects in total abundances of non-target species identified in the food web from the addition of spores in the Bt spray formulation. When the same methods were applied to natural enemies (predators and parasitoids) of foliage-feeding lepidopteran and non-lepidopteran (homopteran, hemipteran and dipteran) herbivores, significant differences between treatments were detected in 7 of 12 cases. However, no treatment differences were found in mean abundances of these natural enemies, either in time-series plots or in total (seasonal) abundance. Analysis of guild-level trajectories revealed population behavior and treatment differences that could not be predicted in whole-community studies of predators and parasitoids. A more conclusive test of the impact of Bt rice will require field experiments with transgenic plants, conducted in a range of Asian environments, and over multiple cropping seasons.

",,,,"The island of Sulawesi in Indonesia is an important site for the wildlife trade that is currently undergoing rapid exploitation of its local fauna to supply wild meat markets of North Sulawesi. In this study, we used field surveys, ethnographic interviews, and daily counts in markets to document species of terrestrial wildlife on sale in North Sulawesi markets, and to identify the hunting sites, practices, and key actors within the wildlife trade. We quantify the volume of wild meat traded and their prices, with a particular focus on the flying fox trade. Wildlife meat was routinely available for sale in 73% of the markets and supermarkets surveyed in North Sulawesi. The wildlife taxa most commonly found in these markets were flying foxes, wild pigs, rats and snakes. Wildlife hunting and trade networks extend to all provinces of the island through a well-organized, dynamic and easy to access network involving many actors. We identified 45 flying fox roosts in Sulawesi, 38 of which were under active hunting pressure. A third of the active hunting sites are located in Southeast Sulawesi, which acts as a hub for bat hunting and trade. We estimate that the number of flying foxes annually traded in Sulawesi ranges from 662,551 to more than one million individuals and conclude that current rates of flying fox harvest are unstainable. Stricter law enforcement, implementation of hunting quotas, and further research efforts are therefore urgently needed to improve the sustainability of the wildlife trade in Sulawesi.

",,,,"Background Antibiotic resistance, evolving and spreading among bacterial pathogens, poses a serious threat to human health. Antibiotic use for clinical, veterinary and agricultural practices provides the major selective pressure for emergence and persistence of acquired resistance determinants. However, resistance has also been found in the absence of antibiotic exposure, such as in bacteria from wildlife, raising a question about the mechanisms of emergence and persistence of resistant strains under similar conditions, and the implications for resistance control strategies. Since previous studies yielded some contrasting results, possibly due to differences in the ecological landscapes of the studied wildlife, we further investigated this issue in wildlife from a remote setting of the Galapagos archipelago. Methodology/Principal Findings Screening for acquired antibiotic resistance was carried out in commensal enterobacteria from Conolophus pallidus, the terrestrial iguana of Isla Santa Fe, where: i) the abiotic conditions ensure to microbes good survival possibilities in the environment; ii) the animal density and their habits favour microbial circulation between individuals; and iii) there is no history of antibiotic exposure and the impact of humans and introduced animal species is minimal except for restricted areas. Results revealed that acquired antibiotic resistance traits were exceedingly rare among bacteria, occurring only as non-dominant strains from an area of minor human impact. Conclusions/Significance Where both the exposure to antibiotics and the anthropic pressure are minimal, acquired antibiotic resistance traits are not normally found in bacteria from wildlife, even if the ecological landscape is highly favourable to bacterial circulation among animals. Monitoring antibiotic resistance in wildlife from remote areas could also be a useful tool to evaluate the impact of anthropic pressure.

To date, 14 species of Phytophthora have been recovered and their distribution determined. Phytophthora nicotianae (=P. parasitica) is the most important species attacking a wide variety of crops, followed by Phytophthora capsici and Phytophthora citrophthora. In contrast to Phytophthora colocasiae attacking taro leaves throughout the entire island, Phytophthora cyperi was found only once on Digitaria ciliaris in Danzhou. It is of interest to note that Phytophthora heveae, Phytophthora katsurae and Phytophthora insolita are commonly found in forest soil/water of protected mountains without causing any plant diseases. Although Phytophthora species are usually terrestrial or found in fresh water, one isolate of Phytophthora resembling closely the asexual isolates of P. insolita in Hainan was obtained from decaying Rhizophora leaves submerged in seawater. An unidentified Phytophthora species producing non-papillate; internally proliferating sporangia was isolated from the soil in which Ceriops tagel and Bruguiera serangula were growing in a salt water shrimp farm.","0931-1785

",,,,"Habitat expansion is a commonly recognized feature of the insular syndrome. It has been explained either by restricted dispersal, intraspecific spillover resulting from density inflation, benign and predictable climate, or by the ecological release that results from species impoverishment. The latter hypothesis has been frequently invoked to explain shifts and/or broadenings of elevational ranges on islands. In this paper, we compared the elevational distribution of 85 terrestrial breeding bird species on a Mediterranean island (Corsica) with their mainland counterparts in a control area of similar altitude, latitude, and climate (Eastern Pyrenees). We calculated specific altitudinal amplitudes in both areas from the upper and lower limits of the bird ranges in the breeding season. We then calculated Island/Mainland Amplitude Ratio (IMAR) for each species.

The ratios we found showed an overall trend in favor of range compressions on Corsica, despite a lower number of species on the island than on the mainland. However the well-differentiated subspecies-level endemics are the ones more likely to expand their ranges on the island. Their frequency is highest in the middle of the elevational gradient, in the cool forests situated between 1400 m and 2000 m.

The non-Mediterranean and non-alpine nature of endemism on Corsica, together with the niche broadening of the endemic forms, can be explained by taking into account Pleistocene glacial–interglacial cycles. The resulting up and down and back again shift of the bioclimatic belts tended, in turn, to eliminate the lower ranging and the higher ranging species from the elevational gradient. The belt that persisted throughout the cycles was the mid-altitude belt, where differentiation processes had sufficient time to lead to endemism. This mechanism also tended to broaden the species ranges, both by selecting among the colonizers those that already had wide ranges on the mainland and by exerting selective pressures on the residents in favor of the broadening of their ranges. More recently, human activities on the island have favored the immigration of undifferentiated species whose elevational ranges are still relatively low.","0012-9658

","Newman, Donald",,Population density,,,1990.0,,,319,330,,,,,,46,3,"Herpetologica
",,"Herpetologists' League
",,,,"Abstract: Leiopelma hamiltoni is a rare species known to occur on only two islands: Maud Island, where it is restricted to a 15 ha forest remnant, and Stephens Island, where it is confined to a 600 m2 rock-tumble. No difference in size, or mass, appears to occur between individuals of the two populations. Minimum adult snout-vent length (SVL) is 35 ? 1 mm (adult size range: 35- 47 mm SVL). The frogs are terrestrial and nocturnal, and their activity, as measured by the number caught/night, is best accounted for by environmental factors relating to moisture: rainfall during or preceding searches and high relative humidity. However, within the generally cool and humid Maud Island forest, the activity of adult frogs was also positively correlated with atmospheric temperature. Lack of diurnal retreat sites appears to limit the distribution of the species on Stephens Island. On both islands, but especially on Stephens, frogs spend the day mainly under rocks. At night, most frogs were found at rocky sites. On Maud Island, frog capture sites were positively correlated with rock substrate, their dispersion paralleling that of the rocky ground cover. In two study plots, the density of adult frogs was calculated to be higher in the plot containing the most extensive rocky ground cover (131 versus 29 frogs/100 m2). On Stephens Island, the dispersion of frog capture sites was highly clumped, concentrations of captures being made on Muehlenbeckia vines covering rocky areas with southerly aspect. There the population density of adult frogs was calculated to be 58/100 m2. Frogs limit their activity on the surface to small areas which may overlap with those of other individuals. The median distances between successive captures of individuals were 0.8 m on Stephens and 0.9 m on Maud Island. At Maud Island, juvenile frogs showed stronger site tenacity than adults. It is suggested that 0.5-1.0 ha of rocky habitat, preferably under forest, should suffice to sustain a population of L. hamiltoni and that, consequently, the Stephens Island habitat is too small to support long-term a viable population. As a conservation measure, a previously formulated proposal to create further rock habitat (or habitat providing retreat sites) in the vicinity of the Stephens Island habitat is supported.

Habitat surveys included five herbaceous and four arboreal habitat types, scaling up from native to anthropogenic managed habitats. We aimed to contribute to the ongoing effort to document the terrestrial biodiversity of the world, in particular the Portuguese archipelago of the Azores, as islands harbour a significant portion of unique terrestrial biodiversity. Selection of Arthropoda groups for the current checklist was based on their known richness and abundance (Arachnida, Collembola, Hemiptera, Neuroptera, Coleoptera, Hymenoptera), in almost all terrestrial ecosystems, as well as their importance in current Integrated Pest Management and alternative Biocontrol protocols at large (i.e. hymenopteran parasitoids and beneficial Coleoptera). In addition, we include the list of Dermaptera, Orthoptera, Psocoptera and Thysanoptera species. These assembled groups represent part of the monitoring programme EDEN Azores (2008-2014), where all Arthropod fauna, at all strata, within nine representative habitats of the abovementioned five Islands of the Azores was recorded.In this study, a total of 116,523 specimens, belonging to 483 species and subspecies of selected groups of arthropods, are reported by order, family and, when possible, genus and species. Hymenopteran, mostly parasitoids, accounted for the most represented taxa across all the monitoring and sampling phase of EDEN Azores (193 species and mophospecies), followed by Coleoptera (95 species); Collembola (89 species); and Araneae (72 species).A total of 37 non-native species are reported for the first time in the Azores.

Arthropods, mainly insects, represent two thirds of biodiversity worldwide, and very likely on Reunion, and more than 75% of the animal diversity in non-marine ecosystems. Moreover, 31% of Reunion's arthropod species are endemic to the island and 40%of the Mascarenes archipelago. Data concerning arthropods collected using standardized protocols over 400 sites spread across the island for the last two decades were gathered to create spatialized, state-of-the-art knowledge on arthropod bidiversity. Standardized collections by vegetation beating and light trapping provide most of the information at both the island and at the major habitat scales, with valuable additional information on the relationship between arthropods and plants at species level. All the main habitats and altitudinal ranges were sampled but in a rather unbalanced way with a scarcity of information on the windward side of the island and associated habitats. In addition, when standardized, collections by vegetation beating allow us to quantify the relationship between arthropod biodiversity metrics such as richness, diversity or endemism, and plant species, habitats and their conservation level. These documented links are helpful tools to de¿ne conservation priorities, as well as to evaluate habitat disturbance or recovery. On permanent reference sites, such protocols, shared with other islands, can be implemented to de¿ne reference states for long term monitoring in the context of biological invasions and global climate change.

",,,,"Aquatic turtles worldwide are plagued with habitat loss due to development and shoreline alteration that destroys the terrestrial–aquatic linkage which they must cross to reproduce successfully. Furthermore, nesting habitat loss can concentrate nesting, increasing nest predator efficiency. We describe how the Paul S. Sarbanes Ecosystem Restoration Project at Poplar Island created nesting habitat for Malaclemys terrapin (Diamondback Terrapin), and document nesting success in response to construction progress and the absence of raccoons and foxes, the primary nest predators. We monitored terrapin nests throughout the nesting seasons from 2002 to 2011 to determine overall and within-nest survivorship. Female terrapins began nesting on the restoration project within 1 year but planned construction during the study eliminated some nesting areas and opened previously inaccessible areas. Overall, nest survivorship was considerably higher than mainland nesting areas due to the absence of raccoons and foxes on the island and within-nest survivorship was similar. Egg size, hatchling size, and the frequency of shell scute anomalies were similar to other terrapin populations, suggesting normal developmental conditions on the island. We documented annual variation in hatchling size that correlated negatively with mean air temperature during the incubation season. Our results indicate that restored or created isolated island habitat can be located rapidly by terrapins and can become an important source of recruitment in regions where nesting habitat is limited and predation is high. Poplar Island illustrates how habitat loss and restoration can affect turtle populations by revealing the changes in nesting patterns and success in newly created, predator-free habitat.","1061-2971

",,,,"Mantella aurantiaca is a small, bright orange, terrestrial amphibian that is endemic to the island of Madagascar. The species has attracted significant attention from herpetologists and captive breeders but relatively little effort has been given to its conservation in the wild. We surveyed 33 reported breeding localities of the species to determine sites of conservation importance and aspects of habitat use and seasonality. We found a total of 471 M. aurantiaca in 26 different localities, all of which were characterised by intact or degraded humid forest on sloping ground alongside temporary lentic ponds in narrow valleys. Additional monitoring at a single site revealed that adult M. aurantiaca predominantly used the ponds and surrounding humid forest habitat during the austral summer and moved upslope at the beginning of the austral winter. Effective conservation for this species should therefore include measures to safeguard both forest and aquatic habitat features. Although 62% of localities occurred in sites with a positive conservation status (provisional protected areas or Ramsar sites), there is currently heavy pressure from artisanal mining, logging and agriculture in these areas. Because a further 15% of sites occur on land due to be impacted by mining and an additional 23% were at sites without any biodiversity management, the future of M. aurantiaca in the wild is precarious. A species conservation strategy is therefore needed to produce a cohesive plan for the future which aims to secure as many sites as possible for conservation.","2156-4574

Future supplements will include the year date for the compilation, rather than a supplement number itself. The rich biodiversity of the Hawaiian Islands is comprised of nearly 24,000 species (Table 1). Hawai'i accounts for only about 0.2% of the land area of the United States, yet it has 31% of the nation's federally listed endangered species and 42% of its endangered birds.

More than 20,000 species are currently available (including terrestrial arthropods, native and alien land and freshwater snails, foraminiferans, marine invertebrates, flowering plants, fungi, amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals). In the Fall of 2000, the Northwest Hawaiian Rapid Assessment and Monitoring Pro-gram (NOW-RAMP) collected extensively in all the Northwest Islands.

",,,,"Body size is one of the most significant features of animals. Not only is it correlated with many life history and ecological traits, but it also may influence the abundance of species within, and their membership of, assemblages. Understanding of the latter processes is frequently based on a comparison of model outcomes with the frequency of species of different body mass within natural assemblages. Consequently, the form of these frequency distributions has been much debated. Empirical data usually concern taxonomically delineated groups, such as classes or orders, whereas the processes ultimately apply to whole assemblages. Here, we report the most complete animal species–body size distribution to date for those free-living species breeding on sub-Antarctic Marion Island and using the terrestrial environment. Extending over 15 orders of magnitude of variation in body mass, this distribution is bimodal, with separate peaks for invertebrates and vertebrates. Under logarithmic transformation, the distribution for vertebrates is not significantly skewed, whereas that for invertebrates is right-skewed. Contrary to expectation based on a fractal or pseudofractal environmental structure, the decline in the richness of species at the smallest body sizes is a real effect and not a consequence of unrecorded species or of species introductions to the island. The scarcity of small species might well be a consequence of their large geographic ranges.

We take an interdisciplinary approach using multiple lines of evidence to understand how past human activity has shaped long-term animal diversity in an island system. Islands afford unique opportunities for such studies given their robust fossil and archaeological records. Herein, we examine the only non-volant terrestrial mammal endemic to the Bahamian Archipelago, the hutia Geocapromys ingrahami . This capromyine rodent once inhabited many islands but is now restricted to several small cays. Radiocarbon dated fossils indicate that hutias were present on the Great Bahama Bank islands before humans arrived at AD ~800–1000; all dates from other islands post-date human arrival. Using ancient DNA from a subset of these fossils, along with modern representatives of Bahamian hutia and related taxa, we develop a fossil-calibrated phylogeny. We found little genetic divergence among individuals from within either the northern or southern Bahamas but discovered a relatively deep North-South divergence (~750 ka). This result, combined with radiocarbon dating and archaeological evidence, reveals a pre-human biogeographic divergence, and an unexpected human role in shaping Bahamian hutia diversity and biogeography across islands.

Microhyla okinavensis has been known as an endemic member of the terrestrial fauna of this archipelago. Molecular phylogenetic analyses using samples from nearly all island populations of the species and representative samples of other east Asian congeneric species revealed that M. okinavensis consists of four distinct subclades, of which the Amami, Okinawa and Miyako subclades, though exhibiting distinct genetic differentiations from each other, formed a monophyletic group (clade A). The remaining Yaeyama subclade was exclusively sister to M. mixtura from inland China, forming another monophyletic group (clade B), rendering M. okinavensis in the current definition paraphyletic. These results, as well as estimated dates of divergence from related taxa, indicate that M. okinavensis actually includes more than one distinct species. The results indicate that M. okinavensis and M. mixtura are relict species with disjunct distributions which had been most probably caused by invasion of M. fissipes in intervening areas.","0300-3256

",,,,"Melanesia is important in any discussion concerned with the distribution of terrestrial Mollusca in the Pacific region, as a zone exhibiting an intermingling of faunas derived from different geographical areas. Along the chain of islands constituting Melanesia these faunal elements exhibit changing patterns consistent with island hopping across water gaps. Yet the numbers of species of Mollusca on these islands show a positive correlation with the size of the individual islands (figure 19) and not, as might be expected, with the distance of particular taxonomic groups from centres of dispersal. Variations in this pattern can be attributed to differences in the isolation of islands, ecological diversity and the paucity of collecting in many areas. It should be realized that the distributional patterns recorded for any particular taxon must reflect the frequency and density of collecting and the inadequacies of the systematics of the group, besides biological attributes of the taxon and the island. The limitations should not distract, however, from attempts to analyse the available information, instead they must serve as a guide to the difficulties involved.","0080-4622

Despite this and evidence of widespread decline, the first comprehensive assessment of the conservation status of Australian terrestrial squamates (snakes and lizards) was undertaken only recently. Here we apply structured expert elicitation to the 60 species assessed to be in the highest IUCN threat categories to estimate their probability of extinction by 2040. We also assessed the probability of successful reintroduction for two Extinct in the Wild (EW) Christmas Island species with trial reintroductions underway. Collation and analysis of expert opinion indicated that six species are at high risk (&amp;gt;50%) of becoming extinct within the next 20 years, and up to 11 species could be lost within this timeframe unless management improves. The consensus among experts was that neither of the EW species were likely to persist outside of small fenced areas without a significant increase in resources for intense threat management. The 20 most imperilled species are all restricted in range, with three occurring only on islands. The others are endemic to a single state, with 55% occurring in Queensland. Invasive species (notably weeds and introduced predators) were the most prevalent threats, followed by agriculture, natural system modifications (primarily fire) and climate change. Increased resourcing and management intervention are urgently needed to avert the impending extinction of Australia’s imperilled terrestrial reptiles.

",,,,"Abstract Large diversifications of species are known to occur unevenly across space and evolutionary lineages, but the relative importance of their driving mechanisms, such as climate, ecological opportunity and key evolutionary innovations (KEI), remains poorly understood. Here, we explore the remarkable diversification of rhacophorid frogs, which represent six percent of global amphibian diversity, utilize four distinct reproductive modes, and span a climatically variable area across mainland Asia, associated continental islands, and Africa. Using a complete species-level phylogeny, we find near-constant diversification rates but a highly uneven distribution of species richness. Montane regions on islands and some mainland regions have higher phylogenetic diversity and unique assemblages of taxa; we identify these as cool-wet refugia. Starting from a centre of origin, rhacophorids reached these distant refugia by adapting to new climatic conditions (‘niche evolution’-dominant), especially following the origin of KEIs such as terrestrial reproduction (in the Late Eocene) or by dispersal during periods of favourable climate (‘niche conservatism’-dominant).

",,,,"A general survey of the mangal at Port Stanley, Malekula, New Hebrides, the most extensive mangal in the archipelago, was conducted over an 11-day period in September/October 1971. Seventeen species of true mangrove tree and mangrove associates were recorded. As is characteristic of mangal, this flora was distributed in a zonal pattern, four zones being recognized. Certain anomalies in zonation were attributed to a recent episode of crustal uplift. The aquatic component of the fauna was dominated by molluscs (26 species) and Crustacea (20 species). The terrestrial vertebrate fauna consisted of 4 species of reptiles, 21 birds and 5 mammals.

The mangrove community at Port Stanley is an integral part of that of the Indo-West Pacific region. However it is much restricted in number of species, and reasons for this are suggested: distance from Malesia, lack of fresh water, and shallow soils with little silt deposition. Faunal impoverishment is clearly associated with floral impoverishment.","0024-4066

",,"Royal Society
",,,,"During the year 1902 I was occupied with a study of the algal flora in the hot-houses of the Royal Botanic Gardens at Kew, and certain observations made then seemed scarcely to support the prevalent view of the very close similarity between tropical and temperate algal vegetation. This stimulated me to undertake a personal investigation of some tropical algal flora, and Ceylon was chosen owing to the diversity of climatic conditions which it presents. My objects was rather to study the ecological and biological aspects of the algal vegetation than to make a systematic collection of materials for a flora, and I hope to be able to show that I have been in some measure successful. A careful analysis, as I think the subsequent pages of this paper will show, brings to light very considerable differences between algal growth in the tropics and in our parts, although a certain similarity between freshwater Algæ all over the surface of the earth (considerably greater than in the case of the terrestrial flora) is indisputable. It is, in fact, a natural consequence of the uniform character of the surrounding medium. The island of Ceylon is peculiarly favourable for a study of the influence of tropical temperature and moisture on the distribution of algal growth, since the rainfall varies considerably in different parts of the island, while the mountainous southern portion (attaining a height of 8000 feet and more) produces a very considerable range of temperature, from the intense heat of Colombo and other lowland places to the high-lying Nuwara Eliya, where, at certain times of the year, the thermometer falls to below freezing point at night. In fact, we have here confined in a narrow compass almost all the different possibilities that can be realised in the tropics. It may be well at this point to briefly outline the range of variation in this respect (see also the map). The low country, with it high tropical temperature, shows great diversity in the amount of rainfall; so that some localities are exceptionally wet (e. g., Kalutara, Labugama), others (under the prevalent tropical conditions) very dry (e. g., Hambantota, Vavoniya), whilst numerous intermediate conditions between the two extremes are found (e. g., at Colombo, Matara, etc.); the wettest place I visited was Labugama (166 inches). The amount of rainfall at Peradeniya is not much less than at Colombo, but the lower temperature, due to the higher altitude, has some influence on the algal vegetation. In travelling upward to Nuwara Eliya the gradual change of temperature is very perceptible; the climate in the uplands is indeed practically European, although not so cold in winter, and considerably hotter in the middle of a sunny day (mean annual temperature a little over 60° F). The rainfall, however, is heavy (about 90 inches), and that produces an abundant vegetation. If we further bear in mind that there is coastal and an inland region, we shall have roughly reviewed the diversity of climatic conditions obtaining in the island.

",,"Oxford University Press
",,,,"The global spread of invasive species has created significant challenges for avian conservation. Introduced predators and pathogens have long been recognized for their direct negative effects on birds, but introduced amphibians can reach high densities on islands with no native amphibians, where they interact with native species. The coqui frog (Eleutherodactylus coqui), introduced to the Hawaiian Islands in the late 1980s, could have significant impacts on birds because it is fully terrestrial and achieves high densities. Coquis have been hypothesized to compete with native birds for invertebrate prey, but could also serve as a novel food resource for birds that consume small vertebrates. To test whether coquis measurably affect bird abundance, we conducted point counts of birds in coqui-invaded and adjacent uninvaded plots across 15 sites on the island of Hawaii, USA. We used N-mixture models to estimate the effect of coqui presence and density on the abundances of both native and nonnative birds, while controlling for possible habitat differences between plots with and without coquis. We found that coquis were associated with ∼35% higher abundance of nonnative birds in general, and more specifically generalist birds that sometimes consume small vertebrates. We suggest that generalist birds increase in abundance with coquis primarily because coquis serve as an abundant food resource. While 4 native bird species co-occurred with coquis, native bird abundance (20% of our total observations) did not show a difference across coqui-invaded and uninvaded plots. Coquis do not appear to be important competitors with native birds in Hawaii, but the frogs are associated with increased abundances of some nonnative birds, which could induce undesirable ecosystem impacts.

The relatively offshore-feeding ancient murrelet nests in colonies, lays two-egg clutches, and has truly precocial young. The inshore-feeding marbled murrelet is apparently a solitary nester, has one-egg clutches, and semiprecocial young. The ancient murrelet feeds predominantly on two species of euphausiid crustaceans, Euphausia pacifica and Thysanöessa spinifera, during the early portion of the terrestrial phase of its breeding cycle (early April to late May), but takes a fish, Ammodytes hexapterus, toward the end of the cycle. It is believed that this change in diet as the season progresses reflects a change in prey availability. The apparent patchy distribution of the prey of the ancient murrelet, which requires more time to locate the food source, has probably promoted the evolution of the 72-h incubation shifts found in this species.During the terrestrial phase of the marbled murrelet's breeding cycle (early May to late August), the fish Ammodytes hexapterus and Cymatogaster aggregata are predominantly taken. During the very early part of its breeding season, Thysanöessa spinifera constitutes a considerable part of its diet.","0008-4301

There has been a continuing effort since 1977 to refine dose assessments for resettlement options at Bikini Atoll. Here we provide a radiological dose assessment for the main residence island, Bikini, using extensive radionuclide concentration data derived from analysis of food crops, ground water, cistern water, fish and other marine species, animals, air, and soil collected at Bikini Island as part of our continuing research and monitoring program that began in 1978. The unique composition of coral soil greatly alters the relative contribution of 137Cs and 90Sr to the total estimated dose relative to expectations based on North American and European soils. Without counter measures, 137Cs produces 96% of the estimated dose for returning residents, mostly through uptake from the soil to terrestrial food crops but also from external gamma exposure. The doses are calculated assuming a resettlement date of 1999. The estimated maximum annual effective dose for current island conditions is 4.0 mSv when imported foods, which are now an established part of the diet, are available. The 30-, 50-, and 70-y integral effective doses are 91 mSv, 130 mSv, and 150 mSv, respectively. A detailed uncertainty analysis for these dose estimates is presented in a companion paper in this issue. We have evaluated various countermeasures to reduce 137Cs in food crops. Treatment with potassium reduces the uptake of 137Cs into food crops, and therefore the ingestion dose, to about 5% of pretreatment levels and has essentially no negative environmental consequences. We have calculated the dose for the rehabilitation scenario where the top 40 cm of soil is removed in the housing and village area, and the rest of the island is treated with potassium fertilizer; the maximum annual effective dose is 0.41 mSv and the 30-, 50-, and 70-y integral effective doses are 9.8 mSv, 14 mSv, and 16 mSv, respectively.","0017-9078

",,,,,,"Abstract The Newell's shearwater, or ‘A’o Puffinus newelli, is endemic to the main islands of the Hawaiian Archipelago and is listed as endangered on the International Union for Conservation of Nature Red List and as threatened under the U.S. Endangered Species Act. Using abiotic and biotic environmental variables, we developed a terrestrial habitat suitability model for this species on Kauai to predict habitat that could be suitable in the absence of anthropogenic threats. In addition, we developed a habitat/threat-isolation index incorporating information from our suitability model to identify regions of structurally suitable habitat with less exposure to certain anthropogenic threats (relative to other portions of the island). The habitat suitability model suggests that slope, density of rock fragments within the soil, and native vegetation cover are important factors associated with the current known distribution of the Newell's shearwater on Kauai, and that a moderate portion of the sloped interior terrain of Kauai could potentially be suitable nesting habitat for this species. The habitat/threat-isolation index identified the mountains on the north-central portion of the island as structurally suitable habitat most isolated from a combination of major anthropogenic disturbances (relative to other portions of the island). Much of this region, however, is privately owned and not designated as an official reserve, which could indicate a need for increased conservation action in this region in the future. This information is important for conservation biologists and private landowners because expanding efforts to control nonnative predators, as well as management of additional lands as reserves, may be necessary for the protection and preservation of the Newell's shearwater.

",,,,"Anthropogenic alteration of biotic distributions and disturbance regimes has dramatically changed the evolutionary context for the differentiation of species traits. Some of the most striking examples in recent centuries have been on islands where flightless birds, which evolved in the absence of mammalian carnivores, have been decimated following the widespread introduction of exotic predators. Until now, no equivalent case has been reported for plants. Here, we make use of robust analytical tools and an exceptionally well-sampled molecular phylogeny to show that a majority of New Zealand danthonioid grasses (Poaceae) may have adapted to the relaxed vertebrate herbivore pressure during the late Cenozoic through the development of a distinctive and unusual habit: abscission of old leaves. This feature occurs in only about 3 per cent of the world's roughly 11 000 grass species and has been empirically shown to increase plant productivity but to reduce protection against mammal grazing. This result suggests that release from a selective pressure can lead to species radiations. This seemingly anachronistic adaptation may represent an overlooked factor contributing to the severe decline in the geographical extent and species diversity of New Zealand's indigenous grasslands following the introduction of herbivorous terrestrial mammals in the 19th century.

Here, we estimate the diversity and a phylogeny for the Australo-Papuan forest dragons (Sauria: Agamidae; ~20 species) in order to examine the following: (1) whether New Guinea and/or proto-Papuan Islands may have been a biogeographical refuge or a source for diversity in Australia; (2) whether mesic rainforest environments are ancestral to the entire radiation, as may be predicted by the New Guinea refuge hypothesis; and (3) more broadly, how agamid ecological diversity varies across the contrasting environments of Australia and New Guinea. Patterns of lineage distribution and diversity suggest that extinction in Australia, and colonization and radiation on proto-Papuan islands, have both shaped the extant diversity and distribution of forest dragons since the mid-Miocene. The ancestral biome for all Australo-Papuan agamids is ambiguous. Both rainforest and arid-adapted radiations probably started in the early Miocene. However, despite deep-lineage diversity in New Guinea rainforest habitats, overall species and ecological diversity is low when compared with more arid areas, with terrestrial taxa being strikingly absent.

",,,,"Located on the northwest coast of Heard Island, a World Heritage-listed sub-Antarctic territory of Australia, Atlas Cove served as the site of the first permanently occupied Australian National Antarctic Research Expedition (ANARE) station (1947–55). Subsequent to its closure, Atlas Cove Station was abandoned and left largely to the mercy of the natural elements, although it has been visited and occupied on an infrequent basis by ANARE. All activities on the island are now subject to the provisions of the Heard Island Wilderness Reserve Management Plan. During 2000–2001 a major clean-up of the site was undertaken, with most of the remaining structures demolished and material collected for return to Australia and disposal. To assess the extent and intensity of contamination within the station area, soil and water samples were collected and analysed for petroleum hydrocarbons and heavy metals. Assessment of site contamination was made with reference to specific background control limits calculated for Atlas Cove Station, and comparison was also made with Australian and New Zealand guidelines for the protection of aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems. Contamination by heavy metals is evident throughout the station but not at levels of sufficient magnitude to infer a significant potential toxic impact on local ecosystems. Hence remedial action to reduce the concentration and mobility of heavy metals in soil and water is not a high priority, although monitoring of changes at the site through time is recommended. Contamination by petroleum hydrocarbons is at a level that may cause a significant toxic impact on the environment and requires further investigation to assess impacts and possibly to undertake remedial action. Given the large quantity of petroleum-contaminated soil present, remediation processes that can be carried out in situ are likely to be the preferable clean-up options. The benefits of remediation, however, must be balanced against any negative effect this might exert on the plant and animal wildlife that have recolonised this historically important site.","0032-2474

",,,,"Ixodes uriae White (Ixodidae, Acarina) is the predominant tick on the Antarctic peninsula. This species has a circumpolar distribution in both hemispheres and is associated with or known to parasitize 48 species of seabirds. Large colonies of 1,000 or more individuals of all life stages were found beneath rocks on the periphery of Adélie penguin rookeries near Palmer Station, Anvers Island. All life stages (egg, larva, nymph, and adult) were intolerant of freezing. Engorged nymphs and larvae had supercooling points between -18 and -20 C. Eggs had the lowest supercooling points (-28.7 C), while adults had the highest values (from -7 to -13 C). Acclimation to temperatures between -12 and +25 C for 2 wk had no effect on the supercooling point of engorged immobile nymphs. Desiccation of engorged nymphs to 80% of their initial weight resulted in no change in supercooling points or glycerol levels. In January, engorged nymphs enter a state of apolysis and lose mobility. Correlated with this change is an increase in cold tolerance as evidenced by a decrease in supercooling points from -11.5 to -19.5 C. This species exhibits the greatest range of thermal tolerance, from -30 to 40 C, reported for any Antarctic terrestrial arthropod. Except for a short period associated with feeding, I. uriae remains in a permanent state of cold-hardiness throughout the year.

",,,,"Olive and olive oil production is one of the main agricultural activities in the Mediterranean region. Besides their economic importance, traditional and organic olive groves were also hypothesized to contribute to biodiversity conservation. For instance, the presence of terrestrial orchids in olive groves has long been known. It is, however, not well understood what ecological or biological traits of olive groves influence the species richness and abundance of these protected flora elements in these secondary habitats. We surveyed 273 olive groves across the mainland of three countries (France, Greece, Italy) and three islands under their administration (Corsica, Lesbos, Sardinia). The surveyed olive groves provided habitat to more than 60,000 orchid individuals belonging to 45 species. Our results indicate that olive groves located on islands had a significantly greater potential for orchid conservation, as they harbored more species and individuals than olive groves on the mainland. Furthermore, orchid presence and species richness was highest in olive groves located on islands with high diversity of pasture weeds or native woody species, while these results also highlight the more traditional use of island groves and a difference in the intensity of maintenance between island and mainland groves. Overall, our study suggests that Mediterranean olive groves contribute significantly to the conservation of diverse terrestrial orchid communities and highlights the importance of traditional management practices in olive groves that allow local biodiversity to flourish.

",,,,"Factors that influence individual and colony spacing are still not well understood in many organisms. Common eiders (Somateria mollissima (L. 1758)) nest on coastal islands and forage in intertidal and shallow subtidal waters. We considered several biotic and abiotic factors, their interactions, and how these might influence the distribution of eider colonies at several spatial scales in Labrador, Canada. At the island level, nest abundance was not related to intertidal prey density. At the 104 km2 grid scale, eider nest abundance and the coefficient of dispersion (CD; the variance to mean ratio of colony size or grid cell, where CD indicates population dispersion) were negatively related to the number of islands. Spring ice cover was positively related to the number of islands but was negatively related to eider nest abundance and to CD. Ice cover – abundance and ice cover – CD were significant at two spatial scales (104 and 455 km2, respectively), but other relationships were weaker at the larger spatial scale. We hypothesize that during the spring, archipelagos with many islands trap ice, providing terrestrial predators access to nesting islands by acting as bridges and that increased predation reduces habitat quality causing nesting eiders to disperse. Our findings suggest that eiders respond to landscape features, including ice cover, a feature that is being influenced by climate change.","0008-4301

Bioclimatic modeling for the prediction of the suitable regional geographical distribution of selected bright-spored myxomycetes in the Philippine archipelago. Biodiversitas 23: 2285-2294. Myxomycetes communities in the Philippines have been well studied in terms of diversity patterns projected by their enigmatic fructifications. To predict potential suitable geographical distributions of three different bright-spored myxomycetes with known variations in its occurrences, namely, Arcyria cinerea, Perichaena depressa, and Hemitrichia serpula, species distribution modeling was utilized. Three different modeling approaches employing MaxEnt were performed in this study and have calculated high model performances based on the AUC values generated (0.778-0.873). In all of the modeling approaches, the three myxomycetes species were predicted to have an expansion of their localized fundamental niches pointing to the influence of isothermality (BIO3) as an important macroclimatic predictor for modeling approaches 1 and 2. Highly suitable habitats for the three bright-spored species were discovered primarily in terrestrial landscapes on the regions of Luzon Island, as well as in small parts of the Visayas and Mindanao Islands. The predicted models in this study do not tell missing geographical information but rather may use as tools for the exploration of potentialities, such as understanding the possible distribution patterns of the three bright-spored myxomycetes species in the Philippines. This can serve as a useful baseline to enhance the conservation efforts for most habitats in the country that are directly affecting microbial communities due to rampant habitat loss and rapid urbanization.

The island's species-poor avifauna includes 11 restricted-range species, including the Critically Endangered endemic Montserrat Oriole Icterus oberi. Analysis of monitoring data from 1997 to 2005 indicates that counts of most species were substantially lower following major ashfalls. However, this effect was short-lived, with rapid population recovery in subsequent years. Furthermore, levels of seasonal rainfall appear to have been at least as important in determining population trends as ashfall. Overall, most species were at least as abundant at the end of the study as at the start, and no forest bird species have been extirpated from Montserrat. We discuss potential ecological drivers of ashfall impacts on populations: there is some evidence that terrestrial foragers were most severely affected.","0019-1019

",,,,"Megafauna extinctions often lead to the disruption of plant-animal interactions, such as the seed-disperser mutualisms, which might entail severe consequences for plant populations and entire communities. Interestingly, the contemporary persistence of anachronistic plant species might be possible thanks to surrogate dispersers or seed dispersal ""rescuers"". We know very little on how these relevant functional replacements are contributing to the performance of present-day plant-frugivore networks. The dwarf palm Chamaerops humilis L. is a Mediterranean endemism with fleshy fruits and typically dispersed by mammals. Despite its ecological importance and wide distribution in some of the Mediterranean islands, no information exists about its seed dispersal on these depauperated-fauna systems. In this study, we aim at identifying and quantifying the relative importance of introduced frugivores on the island of Mallorca (Balearic Islands), where no native terrestrial mammals exist. Specifically, we assess for the first time the seed dispersal effectiveness (SDE) for C. humilis on islands; we evaluate the quantitative component by fecal and regurgitation sampling surveys, and the qualitative component by means of seed germination experiments and seedling growth measures. Introduced goats (Capra hircus L.) and pine martens (Martes martes L.) were the local mammal fruit consumers of C. humilis identified in our study sites. Results suggest that goats are much more important quantitatively than pine martens, due to the high number of fruits handled in each foraging bout and their extremely high abundance on the island. However, pine marten-ingested seeds showed the highest final seedling emergence success and seedling growth, thus its qualitative contribution on C. humilis seed dispersal is higher than that of goats. Overall, SDE was almost 9-fold higher for goats than for pine martens. We conclude that these two non-native mammal species are effective seed dispersers of C. humilis in this and probably other Mediterranean islands, where humans led to the extinction of its native seed dispersers, as it was probably the case of the goat-like Myotragus balearicus in the Balearic Islands.

",,,,"Abstract Background Achatina fulica, the giant African snail, is the largest terrestrial mollusk species. Owing to its voracious appetite, wide environmental adaptability, high growth rate, and reproductive capacity, it has become an invasive species across the world, mainly in Southeast Asia, Japan, the western Pacific islands, and China. This pest can damage agricultural crops and is an intermediate host of many parasites that can threaten human health. However, genomic information of A. fulica remains limited, hindering genetic and genomic studies for invasion control and management of the species. Findings Using a k-mer–based method, we estimated the A. fulica genome size to be 2.12 Gb, with a high repeat content up to 71%. Roughly 101.6 Gb genomic long-read data of A. fulica were generated from the Pacific Biosciences sequencing platform and assembled to produce a first A. fulica genome of 1.85 Gb with a contig N50 length of 726 kb. Using contact information from the Hi-C sequencing data, we successfully anchored 99.32% contig sequences into 31 chromosomes, leading to the final contig and scaffold N50 length of 721 kb and 59.6 Mb, respectively. The continuity, completeness, and accuracy were evaluated by genome comparison with other mollusk genomes, BUSCO assessment, and genomic read mapping. A total of 23,726 protein-coding genes were predicted from the assembled genome, among which 96.34% of the genes were functionally annotated. The phylogenetic analysis using whole-genome protein-coding genes revealed that A. fulica separated from a common ancestor with Biomphalaria glabrata ~182 million years ago. Conclusion To our knowledge, the A. fulica genome is the first terrestrial mollusk genome published to date. The chromosome sequence of A. fulica will provide the research community with a valuable resource for population genetics and environmental adaptation studies for the species, as well as investigations of the chromosome-level of evolution within mollusks.

",,,,"Studies of the interplay of immigration, emigration and extinction in shaping the fauna of islands (McArthur & Wilson, 1967) have influenced the terrestrial ecologists view of the creation and maintenance of diversity. Although in the deep ocean, hydrothermal vents have been the subject of a number of biogeographic studies (Tunnicliffe, 1991), there have been few attempts to validate theories of island biogeography in the shallow marine environment. To rectify this situation, a study comparing the fauna of the mainland of Cornwall, with that of the Isles of Scilly, which lie 45 km from the mainland and were separated from it ~0·3 my BP has been undertaken.

Evidence for some comparative impoverishment of the Isles of Scilly fauna was provided by Crisp & Southward (1958) who noted that a small number of cirripedes and molluscs with planktonic larvae, living close to their geographic limits of distribution in Cornwall, were unable to bridge the gap to the islands. They suggested that although species with long-lived planktonic larvae can be widely dispersed, excessive dispersal can lead to their loss from the fauna of small islands. This is clearly demonstrated on the remote island of Rockall where both Crisp (1956) and Moore (1977) noted that only animals with direct development occur. On the Island of Lundy, four species of gastropod were estimated to be less abundant than on the mainland which lies only 18 km away (Hawkins & Hiscock, 1983). However, such studies only deal with a small number of conspicuous intertidal species, and there is a requirement to expand observations to the community level. The present study attempts to question the following hypotheses: (1) α - diversity (that of single samples) is lower on the islands than the mainland; (2) the diversity of species with planktotrophic larvae is lower on the islands than on the mainland.","0025-3154

Amphibians and reptiles are recognized as sensitive indicators of ecosystem “health,” related to beneficial services (provisional, regulating, cultural, structural, functional) human societies receive from terrestrial watersheds. The Taguibo Watershed supplies fresh drinking water to Butuan City in the Caraga Region of northeast Mindanao Island. However, very little is known about the herpetofauna of the area. Here, we synthesize biodiversity data from historical (1971, 1979) and recent (2013, 2017) herpetological surveys from the region. We utilize specimen-associated occurrence records and natural history information to produce a species inventory, analyze their habitat utilization, and characterize diversity metrics to describe herpetological communities of the watershed – resulting in 44 species (27 new records). A number of historically-documented species persist, having partitioned riparian and terrestrial habitat types in dipterocarp and secondary-growth forests of Taguibo. Reptiles exhibit little overlap in the use of microhabitats – in contrast to amphibians, which exhibit either unique or frequently shared microhabitat substrates. In terrestrial microhabitats (not immediately associated with water), many newly-recorded reptiles and amphibians (particularly, of the genus Platymantis) partition space predictably – either occupying a single microhabitat or, in one species (a pit viper, Tropidolaemus subannulatus), two microhabitats. We anticipate that our initial characterization of Taguibo’s herpetofauna may serve as a baseline to promote further research and facilitate conservation initiatives. We emphasize the importance of primary sources – field-based surveys and re-surveys – and open-access biodiversity data served via online platforms that provide live, transparent access to original, unaltered data. Anthropogenic threats involving economic-driven activities present a need for field-based research in support of watershed management. Periodic, survey, and re-survey studies – continuously updating earlier work – are the most reliable, repeatable, and publicly-transparent use of biodiversity survey data in support of societal benefits and ecosystem services.

",,,,"The small archipelago of Tl'chés, in coastal British Columbia, has gone through drastic social-ecological change culminating in the decline of traditional management practices, invasion of exotic plant species and, in the early 1960s, land abandonment. This is a common trend in cultural landscapes around the world. Cultural landscapes have great social-ecological significance, including cultural safeguarding and renewal, as well as maintenance of biodiversity, ecosystem functions and services, making them objects of special attention in conservation and restoration efforts. This study investigates the relationship between the Lekwungen people and heavily altered ecosystems in the context of ecological restoration for the cultural landscapes of Tl'chés. In order to thoroughly explore the ecological, social and cultural aspects and processes involved in the restoration of Tl'chés, this study combined different environmental sciences methodologies, including historical and archival research, semi-structured interviews and participatory observation with Lekwungen participants, as well as ecological field assessments and an innovative mapping approach termed Terrestrial Cultural Ecosystem Mapping (TCEM). This study generated historical and spatial references for ecosystem and land use change in West Chatham Island, as well as cultural and ecological understandings to support restoration. Although important native species such as Camassia spp. are still thriving, present-day ecosystems on this island are heavily altered from the natural Garry oak ecosystem reference sites and are largely dominated by exotic invasive shrubs and graminoid species. This investigation indicates that the Lekwungen value both the historical ecological conditions of the island and particular types of the present-day novel or hybrid ecological states, such as the overgrown heritage orchard and nonnative berries found on the islands. Present-day ecosystems of Tl'chés are a result of a hybrid management system (traditional and conventional), coupled with land abandonment for many decades. Restoration of Tl'chés must involve both ecological and cultural components. Therefore, intervention strategies should consider the incorporation of novel and hybrid ecosystems (i.e. naturalized exotic species) into a restoration plan for ecological, cultural, historical, and subsistence values.

The majority of species we surveyed were terrestrial direct‐developing frogs or frogs that breed in tank bromeliads, rather than those that use permanent water bodies to breed. Thus, we were able to investigate the climatic correlates of Bd infection in a frog assemblage that does not rely on permanent water bodies. We sampled frogs for Bd across all of the major habitat types on the island, used machine learning algorithms to identify climatic variables that are correlated with infection rates, and extrapolated infection rates across the island. We compared the effectiveness of the machine learning algorithms for species distribution modeling in the context of our study, and found that infection rate rose quickly with precipitation in the driest month. Infection rates also increased with mean temperature in the warmest quarter until 22 °C, and remained relatively level thereafter. Both of these results are in accordance with previous studies of the physiology of Bd . Based on our environmental results, we suggest that frogs occupying high‐precipitation habitats with cool rainy‐season temperatures, though zcurrently experiencing low frequencies of infection, may experience an increase in infection rates as global warming increases temperatures in their habitat.

",,,,"Abstract Aim The Lesser Sunda Islands are situated between the Sunda and Sahul Shelves, with a linear arrangement that has functioned as a two‐way filter for taxa dispersing between the Asian and Australo‐Papuan biogeographical realms. Distributional patterns of many terrestrial vertebrates suggest a stepping‐stone model of island colonization. Here we investigate the timing and sequence of island colonization in Asian‐origin fanged frogs from the volcanic Sunda Arc islands with the goal of testing the stepping‐stone model of island colonization. Location The Indonesian islands of Java, Lombok, Sumbawa, Flores and Lembata. Taxon Limnonectes dammermani and L. kadarsani (Family: Dicroglossidae) Methods Mitochondrial DNA was sequenced from 153 frogs to identify major lineages and to select samples for an exon‐capture experiment. We designed probes to capture sequence data from 974 exonic loci (1,235,981 bp) from 48 frogs including the outgroup species, L. microdiscus . The resulting data were analysed using phylogenetic, population genetic and biogeographical model testing methods. Results The mt DNA phylogeny finds L. kadarsani paraphyletic with respect to L. dammermani , with a pectinate topology consistent with the stepping‐stone model. Phylogenomic analyses of 974 exons recovered the two species as monophyletic sister taxa that diverged ~7.6 Ma with no detectable contemporary gene flow, suggesting introgression of the L. dammermani mitochondrion into L. kadarsani on Lombok resulting from an isolated ancient hybridization event ~4 Ma. Within L. kadarsani, the Lombok lineage diverged first while the Sumbawa and Lembata lineages are nested within a Flores assemblage composed of two parapatrically distributed lineages meeting in central Flores. Biogeographical model comparison found strict stepping‐stone dispersal to be less likely than models involving leap‐frog dispersal events. Main conclusions These results suggest that the currently accepted stepping‐stone model of island colonization might not best explain the current patterns of diversity in the archipelago. The high degree of genetic structure, large divergence times, and absent or low levels of migration between lineages suggests that L. kadarsani represents five distinct species.

",,,,"Abstract Aim Whether entire communities of organisms converge towards predictable structural properties in similar environmental conditions remains controversial. We tested for community convergence in birds by comparing the structure of oceanic archipelago assemblages with their respective regional species pools. Location Eighteen major oceanic archipelagos of volcanic origin with global distribution. Major taxa studied Terrestrial birds. Methods We compiled a comprehensive database of morphological trait and phylogenetic data for 6,579 bird species, including species known to have become extinct owing to human activities. We quantified morphological and phylogenetic dissimilarity among species between pairs of archipelagos, using a modified version of the mean nearest taxon distance. We tested for convergence by estimating whether overall mean turnover among archipelagos and pairwise turnover between archipelagos were lower than expected by chance. Results For all land birds, we found that turnover in body plan, body mass and phylogeny among archipelagos was significantly lower than expected. Seventeen (of 18) archipelagos showed significant body plan and phylogenetic similarity with at least one other archipelago. Similar convergent patterns of community assembly were detected in different subsamples of the data (extant species, endemics, native non‐endemics, and Passeriformes only). Convergence was more pronounced for extant species than for extant and extinct species combined. Main conclusions Consistent convergence in phylogenetic and morphological structure among archipelagic communities arises through a combination of non‐random colonization and in situ adaptation. In addition, by including data from extinct taxa, we show that community convergence both precedes and is accentuated by the anthropogenic extinction of endemic lineages. Our results highlight the potential role of non‐random extinction in generating patterns of community convergence and show that convergence existed even before anthropogenic extinctions, owing to deterministic community assembly in similar environmental settings at the global scale.

",,,,"The status of the Humboldt Penguin (Spheniscus humboldti) was investigated in Peru after the 1997-98 El Niño event, the strongest of the last century. Penguin numbers along the southern and central coast of Peru (97% of the total) did not differ significantly between 1999 and 2000; the average number was 4,425 individuals. In 1999, the proportion of juveniles (one-year-old birds) was only 0.2% compared with 7% in 2000, probably as a result of the 1997-98 El Niño. Penguins were found from La Foca Island (512’S) to Punta Coles (1742’S). However, the majority (78%) were clustered in five localities, Punta San Juan (36%), San Juanito Islet (11%), Hornillos Island (10%), Pachacamac Island (12%) and Tres Puertas (9%). The size and distribution of penguin colonies have changed over the last 15 years. Penguins have abandoned sites at Punta Corio, Sombrerillo and Morro Sama, and have decreased significantly in numbers in Punta San Fernando and Punta La Chira, where human disturbance has increased, mainly due to local fisheries activities. Penguins have increased at Punta San Juan, San Juanito Islet and San Gallan Island, all of which are partially protected. Half of the penguins were located in guano bird reserves, primarily at Punta San Juan. Guano bird reserves provide some protection against terrestrial predators and human disturbance; however, periodical guano extraction decreases their breeding success. Most penguin sites were found in inaccessible and marginal areas, which were vulnerable to occasional and unpredictable flooding from ocean swells. The methodology recommended by the Population and Habitat Viability Assessment workshop for a consistent census of penguins in Peru and Chile during the molting period was validated at the Punta San Juan Reserve. Continued monitoring of Humboldt Penguin numbers is recommended in order to more fully understand patterns of fluctuation and to be able to detect changes of conservation concern as early as possible. Collaborative efforts between local authorities and conservation biologists are needed to monitor and protect this vulnerable species.","1524-4695

",,,,"Stranded marine fauna have been identified as a potentially significant food resource for terrestrial carnivores, but how such subsidisation influences terrestrial species ecology is not well understood. We describe the dietary and behavioural responses of dingoes (Canis familiaris) to the occurrence of large-animal marine strandings (e.g. dead cetaceans, marine turtles and pinnipeds) between 2006 and 2016 on K’gari (Fraser Island), Australia, to better understand the trophic links between marine and terrestrial systems. A total of 309 strandings were recorded during this period (~3.1 strandings per month), yielding an annual average of 30.3 tons of available carrion to the 100–200 dingoes present on the island. Carcass monitoring with camera traps showed that dingoes used carcasses almost daily after a short period of decomposition. Whole packs of up to seven dingoes of all age classes at a time were observed visiting carcasses for multiple successive days. These data demonstrate that large-animal marine subsidies can be a common, substantial and important food source for dingoes, and that the estimated daily dietary needs of roughly 5–10% of the island’s dingo population were supported by this food source. Our data suggest that marine subsidisation can influence terrestrial carnivore diet, behaviour and abundance, which may produce cascading indirect effects for terrestrial ecosystems in contexts where subsidised carnivores interact strongly with other species.","0004-959X

Its main parts are described: the plant-internal cycle, the ecosystem-internal cycle and the global N-cycle, including input-output relations and biological N-fixation. The distribution of total nitrogen (Nt) as well as the net mineralization of nitrogen in the soils of a dune succession on Spiekeroog Island (Germany) are described. Values for 13 different sites are given, ranging from foredunes to climax dune forests in a chronosequence from 0 to >250 years. In the course of development, the N-pools in the soils increase from approximately 150 kg to more than 3000 kg Nt · ha-1 · 30 cm-1. Mineralization process investigations indicate an increase of mineral nitrogen (Nmin) rates from about 10-20 kg in the sands of the beachplain and younger dunes up to 50 kg in the brown dunes and more than 100 kg Nmin · ha-1 · vegetation period-1 in natural dune forest soils. The input-output balance of the nitrogen cycle is estimated from literature data. The impact of the microclimate seems to be important in older dune ecosystems with zonal vegetation but less so in the foredunes with azonal vegetation. The impact of microclimate on the mineralization process is estimated to be small in the azonal foredune vegetation around the coasts of Europe. It is expected that climatic change has a strong impact only on nitrogen mineralization (and vegetation) of slopes of older dunes with zonal vegetation and soils.","0340-269X

",,,,"Since the introduction of non-native rodents to the Caribbean region, these invaders have successfully occupied many, if not most, islands where they pose tremendous threats to native biodiversity and ecosystems. The objective of our study was to conduct a preliminary assessment of the relative abundance of invasive alien rodents in different vegetation types on the small Caribbean island of St. Eustatius, which has no native rodent species. We used tracking tunnels (baited ink cards placed in tunnels to identify the prints of animals lured to the card) to determine the presence of rodent species. We collected data in 25 × 25 m (n = 13) and 5 × 5 m (n = 130) plots to determine whether elevation, number of tree species, canopy cover or other microhabitat components were correlated with rodent relative abundance. Invasive rodents are present in varying relative abundances in rural areas on St. Eustatius. House mice (Mus musculus) were not recorded inside the terrestrial protected areas, whereas black rats (Rattus rattus) were detected in all elevations and all but one vegetation type sampled. We determined significant correlations between some of the habitat characteristics, especially elevation, canopy height, leaf litter cover and number of tree species, which showed significant collinearity with 27 of 45 pairwise comparisons. There was a significant correlation between rodent relative abundance and the number of tree species, but not between elevation, number of living trees, number of shrubs, rainfall, canopy cover, canopy height, leaf litter cover, leaf litter depth, or slope. There was a significant difference within vegetation types for the frequency of traps containing rat versus mouse tracks. Our study was impacted by two major hurricanes in September 2017.

",,,,"An arboreal lifestyle is thought to be central to primate origins, and most extant primate species still live in the trees. Nonetheless, terrestrial locomotion is a widespread adaptation that has arisen repeatedly within the primate lineage. The absence of terrestriality among the New World monkeys (Platyrrhini) is thus notable and raises questions about the ecological pressures that constrain the expansion of platyrrhines into terrestrial niches. Here, we report the results of a natural experiment, comparing patterns of terrestrial behavior in white-faced capuchin monkeys (Cebus capucinus imitator) living on two islands off the Pacific coast of Panama that lack mammalian predators (island sites) with the behavior of capuchins at three sites in central Panama with more intact predator communities (mainland sites). Surveys with camera traps revealed increased terrestriality in island vs. mainland sites. Capuchin detection rates were higher, the range of party sizes observed was larger, and individuals engaged in a wider range of terrestrial behaviors on the islands lacking mammalian predators. Furthermore, females carrying infants were frequently photographed on the ground at the island sites, but never at the mainland sites. These findings support the long-standing hypothesis that predators constrain the exploitation of terrestrial niches by primates. These results are also consistent with the hypothesis that arboreal locomotion imposes costs that primates will avoid by walking on the ground when predation risk is low.

Previous national- and international-level inventories document Belizean mangrove forests at spatial resolutions of 30 m or coarser, but many mangrove patches and loss events may be too small to be accurately mapped at these resolutions. Our 10 m map addresses this need for a finer-scale national mangrove inventory. We mapped mangrove ecosystems in Belize as of 2020 by performing a random forest classification of Sentinel-2 Multispectral Instrument imagery in Google Earth Engine. We mapped a total mangrove area of 578.54 km2 in 2020, with 372.04 km2 located on the mainland and 206.50 km2 distributed throughout the country’s islands and cayes. Our findings are substantially different from previous, coarser-resolution national mangrove inventories of Belize, which emphasizes the importance of high-resolution mapping efforts for ongoing conservation efforts.

This paper presents the context, the state of biogeographical and taxonomic knowledge prior to our expeditions, and the objectives, the methods and the first results obtained. The aim was to establish a modern survey of the species present in a selection of sites representative of different Corsican ecosystems, and to further develop the natural history collections through depositing new specimens and species with associated standard DNA barcodes, useful for their identification. Over a period of three years, nineteen sites were surveyed with a semi-standardised protocol and a large-scale trapping scheme was organised in three of these. Sampling efforts focused on forest habitats at higher altitudes and on coastal dune and lowland marshland habitats. A vast array of methods was used to collect invertebrates, with a specific effort on flightinterception traps and pan traps. A total of 34 experts participated to the field surveys and more than 80 further contributed to the study of the specimens. Occurrence data are available in the Inventaire national du patrimoine naturel (http://www.inpn.fr) and, for specimens processed through DNA barcoding, specimen and DNA sequencing data will be accessible in the Barcode of Life datasystems (BOLD : http://www.boldsystems.org). In early 2023, the assembled datasets included 31,100 occurrence data for 3,900 taxa of terrestrial arthropods, representing a 53% increase in publicly available data for the island. More than 6,800 DNA barcode sequences have been produced for arthropods, representing a 14-fold increase in available sequences of Corsican insects compared to those available before the start of the programme.

",,,,"Two species of small gekkonid lizards, genus Sphaerodactylus, occur on St. Croix. S. macrolepis occupies most of the island, and S. beattyi is restricted to three disjunct areas in the eastern part of St. Croix. There is little or no overlap of the two species' ranges. At several points the two are very sharply parapatric. We compare the current distributions with records from the late 1930's and from 1965. Borders between the two species appear to have oscillated back and forth during the last 40 years. This distributional pattern is probably due to the competitive exclusion of beattyi by macrolepis from the more mesic portions of the island, which appears to be the most favorable habitat for both species. Evaporative water loss is significantly lower for beattyi, supporting this interpretation. We discuss a model of interspecific competition along an environmental gradient which could explain these observations.","0006-3606

",,,,"The natural communities of Gough Island have the reputation of being amongst the most pristine of any cool-temperate oceanic island. However, Gough Island is relatively depauperate in indigenous invertebrates, and preliminary results of an ongoing terrestrial invertebrate survey have shown that introduced species now equal, or exceed, the numbers of indigenous species in many groups. Furthermore, many of these introductions are likely to have occurred within the last 50 years. Such high rates of recent introductions constitute a significant conservation threat to the indigenous invertebrates and the island's biodiversity as a whole. In addition, endemic invertebrate species are amongst the prey of a non-invertebrate introduction, the house mouse (Mus musculus Linn.). In this paper, we review the present knowledge of the invertebrates of Gough, report on the preliminary observations of the ongoing Gough Island Terrestrial Invertebrate Survey, and discuss the implications of introduced species for the conservation of Gough Island's indigenous species.","1021-3589

",,,,"In island ecosystems, biological invasions are one of the major threats to native biodiversity and to ecosystem functioning. Invasive ornamental plants such as the alien palm tree Pinanga coronata in the Fiji islands can form mono-dominant stands in rainforests and displace native species. Using a functional trait-based approach, we investigated the impact of P. coronata on both above and belowground communities (i.e. plants and Collembola). Within a rainforest reserve on Fiji´s principal island, we sampled a total of 10 invaded and non-invaded plots and recorded five functional traits for plants and six for Collembola. We found that invasion by P. coronata led to a strong and significant decrease of native plants and Collembola taxonomic diversity. Ingress of P. coronata also induced a decrease in the functional diversity of plant communities and to a lesser extent of Collembola communities. P. coronata invasion led to a decrease of leaf carbon–nitrogen ratio (LCN), Leaf nitrogen content (LN), specific leaf area (SLA) and leaf dry matter content (LDMC) of plant communities, suggesting a change in litter properties compared to non-invaded communities. Plots with P. coronata were associated with large Collembola living at the soil surface with more trichobothria and pseudocelli, which are used as defence mechanisms. Using trait-matching, we also found that the strength of plant-soil relationships was higher (i.e. more stable) in non-invaded plots than in P. coronata-invaded plots. Lastly this study suggests that the main mechanism through which P. coronata alters soil communities is a change in plant properties rather than a change in the abiotic environment. Our trait-based approach underlines the negative impact of this alien palm invasion on native rainforest plant and soil fauna in Fiji, and the urgent need for on-the-ground action to conserve terrestrial island biodiversity in Fiji´s rainforests.","1442-9985

Poa annua, the longest-established species, increased its range substantially after 1987, prior to which it was confined to a single site for more than 20 years. It remains largely restricted to sites characterized by intense disturbance by seals and seabirds. Sagina procumbens, the most recently discovered alien plant, has spread even more rapidly (up to 800 m year−1) and has colonized the west coast of the island (a leap of at least 3 km). Unlike Poa annua, it is not restricted to animal-disturbed areas, although its seeds probably are dispersed by both birds and fur seals. Cerastium fontanum also continues to spread at the island, but remains confined to the western coastal plain, where it occurs mostly on dry feldmark slopes or erosion scars. All three species have expanded their ranges faster than at Marion Island, possibly because of a warmer recent climate and higher densities of seabirds and seals at Prince Edward Island. The ranges of alien plants are likely to continue to expand, with S. procumbens causing considerable changes in the island's terrestrial ecology.","1814-232X

In the present study, we conducted a 7-month survey within a 5-km stretch in the urbanised Attanagalu-Oya river area to study habitat associations, mesohabitat use and behaviour of V. salvator in urban landscapes. The greatest number of monitor sightings was made in aquatic habitats, followed by terrestrial and arboreal habitats within the riparian zone. Sightings of different life history stages of V. salvator across major habitat types varied significantly. The adults and subadults associated mostly with aquatic and terrestrial habitats, whereas hatchlings and juveniles associated mostly with aquatic and arboreal habitats. Given variable sighting frequencies of distinct life history stages across different major habitat types, it is likely that there is substantial age-structured niche partitioning in V. salvator. The urban population of V. salvator studied seemed to be fairly abundant, and resilient to anthropogenic stressors and adversity of urbanisation. In species-depauperate urban environments, ecosystem functions provisioned by V. salvator as generalist predators as well as scavengers are arguably significant and deserve further investigation.

",,"Frontiers Media
",,,,"Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit (commonly known as leucaena) is a leguminous species of the family Fabaceae and a native of Mexico and Central America. It is often addressed as a “miracle tree” for offering a wide variety of ecosystem services and possessing strong ecological attributes. The multiple uses of leucaena in agroforestry, livestock, and restoration practices led to the worldwide distribution of its ssp. glabrata and leucocephala . However, following its introduction into non-native regions, the commercial value of ssp. leucocephala was challenged by its large-scale spread outside the cultivation zone. It has assumed a status of an environmental weed and invasive plant in many regions across Africa (17 countries and Island nations), Asia (17), Europe (1), Oceania (23), North America (12), and South America (7). The plant is enlisted in the top five terrestrial invasive plant species with the greatest international presence. The species is now considered one of the 100 worst invaders in the world. The plant mainly invades roadsides, wastelands, cultivated lands, riverbanks, and forest edges, and suppresses the growth of other woody and herbaceous species. Its infestations alter the patterns of vegetation, plant succession, and community assembly in the introduced habitats. Propagation of ssp. leucocephala , without considering the environmental risks associated with it, may result in major repercussions and irreparable losses. Therefore, it is important to discuss its invasive propensities and the possible alternatives that may replace the weedy species without encumbering its economic benefits. This review aims to thoroughly evaluate the ecological and invasive attributes of leucaena, promote awareness about the ecological costs associated with its spread, and suggest suitable options for its management.

",,"Florida Entomological Society
",,,,"While identifying material in the Florida State Collection of Arthropods (FCSA), I found specimens of cicadas that represent new distribution records for the cicadas that inhabit the Bahamas. The Bahamas are an archipelago of approximately 700 islands and islets and 2400 cays north of the Greater Antilles (Cohen 1998). These islands were almost completely inundated around seventy thousand years ago during the last interglacial thaw after the Sangamon Ice Age (Cranton & Saunders 1992). Thus, the terrestrial fauna and flora are of relatively recent origin. The first cicada to be described from the Bahamas was Diceroprocta bonhotei (Distant 1901). It has been attributed to New Providence and Andros Islands (Davis 1928). Specimens in the FCSA were collected in Nassau, New Providence, Bahamas which substantiates the distribution previously reported (Davis 1928). In addition, one specimen from the FCSA was collected on Eleuthera which extends the distribution of D. bonhotei approximately 80 km east-northeast of New Providence Island. I have also identified a single specimen of D. bonhotei in the K. C. Emerson Entomology Museum at Oklahoma State University from Norman's Cay which is one of the northern Exuma Cays approximately 75 km southeast of Nassau. These new records extend the known distribution of D. bonhotei to the eastern and central cays of the northern island group. The distribution of D. bonhotei is restricted to the Bahamas. Diceroprocta bonhotei is morphologically related to D. cleavesi Davis (1930) and D. caymanensis Davis (1939a) from the Cayman Islands, D. biconica (Walker) (Davis 1932; Davis 1935) and its variety from the Florida Keys, Cuba, the Isle of Pines, and Mexico (Metcalf 1963), andD. bicosta (Walker) (Davis 1928) reported from Cuba and Central America (Metcalf 1963). The morphological similarities suggest a common ancestry for the Diceroprocta species of the West Indies. A second cicada species found in the Bahamas, Ollanta caicosensis Davis, was originally described from South Caicos Island (type location), Acklin's Island, East Caicos Island, West Caicos Island, and Great Inagua Island (Davis 1939b). All but Acklin's Island are part of the Turks and Caicos Island group which forms the southeastern end of the Bahama Island chain. I have identified specimens in the FSCA that extend the known range of 0. caicosensis in the Commonwealth of the Bahamas. The newly identified specimens were collected on Mayaguana and Long Island. The Mayaguana specimens fill the gap in the distribution for the Turks and Caicos group to Acklin's Island. The Long Island specimen extends the known range of 0. caicosensis some 170 km northwest of Acklin's Island across the Crooked Island Passage. This places 0. caicosensis on islands of the Bahamas Platform proper. The genus Ollanta has a broad, discontinuous distribution. Ollanta species are found in the Bahamas (Davis 1939b), Central America (Metcalf 1963), and Hispaniola (Ramos 1983). The ancestor of 0. caicosensis may have migrated from the west onto the large island that would become the Bahamas during the last glacial period. Bahamian organisms that do not migrate easily show more affinities to the fauna of Cuba and Hispaniola than to that of the mainland United States (Cranton & Saunders 1992). This would support the hypothesis of an eastward migration of the ancestors of 0. caicosensis across Cuba or a northward migration from Hispaniola. The two Bahamian cicada species differ in size. Diceroprocta bonhotei is a relatively large species (body length 29-35 mm, wing span 89-110 mm) that inhabits the northwestern islands Ollanta caicosensis is a much smaller species (body length 18-22 mm, wing span 52-65 mm) that inhabits the southeastern half of the Bahamas and the Turks and Caicos. I wish to thank Julieta Brambila of the Florida State Collection of Arthropods and Donald Arnold of the K. C. Emerson Entomology Museum for their assistance during my visits.

",,,,"A two-summer, mark-recapture study of Laysan Ducks (Anas laysanensis) resulted in a population estimate of 510 birds with over 90% of the birds marked. Individuals seemed long-lived with the low reproductive rate common to K-selected species.

Nesting occurred in spring and early summer in spite of the subtropical climatic regime. Nests were mainly in clumps of grass (Eragrostis) and hatching success was low. Duckling mortality due to exposure was common during rainstorms, but no direct predation was noted. Pair-bond behavior resembled that of continental populations of Mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) but males tended to return to mates after brood-rearing or loss of brood or nest. Year-to-year mate switching occurred more than half the time, even when previous mates were alive. Males did not assist in care of the brood.

During spring and summer, ducks of all ages fed heavily on invertebrates. Adult brine flies (Neoscatella sexnotata) on mud flats around the lake were the major food of ducks of all ages. Radio-marked pairs consistently used the same upland areas during the day. At night, most ducks moved to a lake on the island to feed, and to drink in communal areas at freshwater seeps. Feeding and drinking was dominantly crepuscular and nocturnal at the lake, but laying hens or hens with broods sometimes fed throughout the day as well.

Conservation of the species requires monitoring of duck populations and habitat conditions, and surveillance for accidentally introduced predators such as rats. The lake is vital to the success of the species, and it is unlikely that a significant population could survive on terrestrial resources alone. Intensive management will be necessary only if blowing sands fill the lake, predators become established, or the vegetation is seriously damaged in some way.","0010-5422

We also focused on investigating the traits of six most widely spread invasive plants and plant distributions in seven types of terrestrial ecosystems. Three hypotheses were deployed in this study: (1) the ecological effects of plant invasion were related to the characteristics of invaded ecosystems and successional phases of invaded communities; (2) the invasive plants rather affected certain functional groups than the whole communities; (3) and most invasive plant species tended to colonize frequently disturbed ecosystems, while they were usually excluded by intact forest ecosystems.

The plot survey was conducted to investigate the distributions of the 20 target invasive plants. The appearance frequency of the six most widely spread invasive plants (i.e., Chromolaena odorata, Praxelis clematidea, Mimosa pudica, Wedelia trilobata, Conyza sumatrensis, and Lantana camara) was compared among seven terrestrial ecosystems (i.e., secondary forest, farmland, grassland, abandoned land, plantation, village, and forest edge) to evaluate the invasibility of different ecosystems. The plots invaded by target species were classified, and species richness of native species in these invaded plots was compared using one-way ANOVAS. Relationships between the total coverage of invasive plants and the species richness of native plants were assessed using a linear regression model.

(1) A total of 11 noxious invasive plants were found in Hainan Island, accounting for 55% of the target specie. (2) The target invasive species were mostly distributed in the northeastern and southwestern regions of Hainan Island, less in the southeastern region, and least in the central region. (3) An order of the intensity regarding plant invasiveness was expressed as Praxelis clematidea > Chromolaena odorata > Mimosa pudica > Wedelia trilobata > Lantana camara > Conyza sumatrensis. The appearance frequency of Conyza sumatrensis and Lantana camara showed no significant differences among the surveyed ecosystems, while Praxelis clematidea, Mimosa pudica and Wedelia trilobata had obviously higher appearance frequency in plantations and abandoned lands, in farmlands, and in plantations, respectively. (4) Farmlands, plantations and abandoned lands were the most frequently invaded ecosystems; but forest edges and natural secondary forests appeared to be less vulnerable to plant invasion. (5) The appearance frequency of invasive plants was negatively correlated with plant coverage of the community invaded by the target species. The total coverage of invasive plants and the richness of native plant species showed a positive correlation in grasslands when the coverage was within a certain extent, and a negative correlation both in forest edges and abandoned lands, and no obvious correlation in plantations farmlands and village sites.","1005-264X

Using rigorous ancient-DNA protocols, we retrieved approximately 1,000 genomic markers from approximately 100 historic specimens of two Southeast Asian songbird complexes from across the Sunda Shelf archipelago collected 1893-1957. We show that the genetic affinities of populations on small shelf islands defy the predictions of geographic distance and appear governed by Earth-historic factors including the position of terrestrial barriers (paleo-rivers) and persistence of corridors (Quaternary land bridges). Our analyses suggest that classic island-biogeographic predictors may not hold well for population-genomic dynamics on the thousands of shelf islands across the globe, which are exposed to dynamic changes in land distribution during Quaternary climate change.

Godwits were sampled just before or after migratory movements between England and Iceland. The germinability of seeds was tested. Intact diaspores were recovered from all bird species and study areas, and were present in 13% of samples overall. Thirteen plant families were represented, including Charophyceae and 26 angiosperm taxa. Only four species had an ‘endozoochory syndrome’. Four alien species were recorded. Ellenberg values classified three species as aquatic and 20 as terrestrial. Overall, 89% of seeds were from terrestrial plants, and 11% from aquatic plants. Average seed length was higher in redshank pellets than in their faeces. Six species were germinated, none of which had an endozoochory syndrome. Seeds were recorded during spring and autumn migration. Plant species recorded have broad latitudinal ranges consistent with LDD via shorebirds. Crucially, morphological syndromes do not adequately predict LDD potential, and more empirical work is required to identify which plants are dispersed by shorebirds. Incorporating endozoochory by shorebirds and other migratory waterbirds into plant distribution models would allow us to better understand the natural processes that facilitated colonization of oceanic islands, or to improve predictions of how plants will respond to climate change, or how alien species spread.

They are characterised by having partly or entirely complanate foliate stems and branches, whereby the leaves are arranged in two rows of asymmetrical, lateral leaves and a single, ventral row of smaller, symmetrical amphigastria. Seven genera are recognised. The c. 160 validly published species and intraspecific taxa are reduced to 21 species. The family shows its greatest diversity in Indo Malaysia (11 species) and Australasia (9 species). Africa and the New World are poor in species with, respectively, 3 and 5 representatives. In the past, the Hypopterygiaceae were regarded as a monophyletic family, but during the last twenty years this status has frequently been discussed. Several authors suggested the Hypopterygiaceae to be polyphyletic, while others still regarded the family as monophyletic. However, a series of phylogenetic analyses performed in this study — based on 57 morphological characters and, initially, 34 species, including the Hypopterygiaceae and representatives of possibly related families — supports the monophyletic status of the Hypopterygiaceae. Based on the outcomes of the analyses, the genus Cyathophorella (Broth.) M. Fleisch. is united with Cyathophorum P. Beauv., which results in the well-supported, monophyletic genus Cyathophorum with 7 species. The genus is nested in a monophyletic Dendrocyathophorum Lopidium Cyathophorum clade. Lopidium Hook. f. & Wilson is a well-supported monophyletic genus of two species. Dendrocyathophorum Dixon is a monotypic genus that is maintained as a separate genus. One of the most characteristic features of Dendrocyathophorum, the central cavity in its axes, is a plesiomorphic condition and a synapomorphy of the DENDROCYATHOPHORUM L0PIDIUM C YATHOPHORUM CLADE Hypopterygium Brid. is a paraphyletic genus of 7 species, which has a basal position to the Dendrocyathophorum-Lopidium-Cyathophorum clade. The monotypic genera Catharomnion Hook. f. & Wilson and Canalohypopterygium W. Frey & Schaepe form a monophyletic clade with a basal position to the Hypopterygium grade. Catharomnion and Canalohypopterygium share the — for mosses unique — rudimentary branches and associated cavity system, but are maintained as separate genera, because of distinct morphological differences, in particular in sporophytic characters. Dendrohypopterygium is a newly described paraphyletic genus of two species, which has a basal position to the Hypopterygiaceae in the obtained phylogenetic trees. The distribution of extant Hypopterygiaceae is probably the result of a combination of dispersal and continental drift acting as vicariance and speciation events. Dispersal of Hypopterygiaceae occurs by means of detached branch fragments, detached leaves, gemmae, and spores. Vegetative propagulae and a portion of the spores mainly contribute to local dispersal and the maintenance and growth of local populations. Dispersal by spores is most common over longer distances. However, the survival rate of spores of Hypopterygiaceae under conditions occurring during long-distance transport in air streams is low. Effective long-range dispersal is probably rare in Hypopterygiaceae, and may have occurred only few times in the history of the family (e.g. Hypopterygium sandwicense on the Hawaiian Islands). Endemism in New Zealand, Australia, and South America suggests that the origin of the Hypopterygiaceae is situated in East Gondwanaland. The presumably terrestrial, dendroid ancestral species were probably distributed in active mountain ranges on the margin of the continent and faced cool temperate conditions and occupied humid, terrestrial habitats at low altitude. Descendants of the cool-temperate ancestor(s) probably moved to higher altitudes due to climatic changes in the course of the Cretaceous. Speciation was induced as a result of fragmentation of the original distribution area in combination with a change of ecological conditions towards a higher humidity and precipitation. Descendants of the terrestrial ancestral species became epiphytic and epilithic. The rise and radiation of angiosperms have presumably favoured the appearance of epiphytes. The Hypopterygiaceae are probably at least 84 million years old, but presumably much older. The existence of most extant species and their present distribution can be explained by northwards rafting on drifting fragments of East Gondwanaland during the Cretaceous or Cenozoic period in combination with mainly short range dispersal events. It seems that Hypopterygiaceae experienced low evolution rates, but part of the family faced probably a Cretaceous radiation event eventually resulting in the appearance of pinnate or simple epiphytic species. Intraspecific variation that is found in some Hypopterygium-species (H. tamarisci, H. flavolimbatum, and H. didictyon) is perhaps of Late Cenozoic origin, and may represent an early stage of a second radiation event due to the climatic changes in the Late Cenozoic.",,,,,,,,,,,,No,,,,"com, pop, trait",,,0.05117344185709953,0,0.05641258537149481,1.0,0,977.0

Marine populations are typically open, and local production may have little impact on local recruitment, such that long-distance dispersal is an important determinant of population ecology. Since oceanic islands form discrete patches of habitat surrounded by a structurally different environment, we tested the general hypothesis that processes operating at the scale of islands have a greater influence on these populations than the processes operating at smaller, intra-island scales. A hierarchical design examined the patterns of abundance and distribution of conspicuous taxa at 3 tidal heights at a range of spatial scales, ranging from a few meters to hundreds of kilometres apart in the rocky intertidal of the Azores. Both uni- and multivariate analyses showed that at the largest scale (islands), significant variation was detected in the lower and mid-shore communities, but not on the upper shore. Along the vertical gradient of immersion there was a trend for increasing small-scale patchiness towards the top of the shore. The potential role of local environmental stress gradients and broad-scale oceanographic patterns of recruitment in structuring these assemblages is discussed. This study corroborates the suitability of the analytical tools used here to examine patterns of distribution over a range of spatial scales and its applicability in the field of island marine ecology.

","Buckle, A.; Fenn, M.",,Conservation Plan,,,1992.0,,,,,,,,,,15,15,"Proceedings - Vertebrate Pest Conference
",,,,,,"ABSTRACT: The commensal rodent pest species have spread from their ancestral homes in Asia to inhabit many natural
ecosystems worldwide. The introduction of these exotics has often had a significant effect on endemic plant and animal species
but their impact has, perhaps, been most severe on off-shore and oceanic islands where nesting birds, insects, terrestrial
molluscs, reptiles and amphibians are all vulnerable. Conservationists have used a variety of control approaches either to
reduce or eliminate the pressure of competition and predation exerted by introduced rodents on island populations of endangered species. Successful projects have involved a sequence of carefully-planned operations. Firstly, an assessment of the
nature and scope of the rodent threat is undertaken to permit the development of a control programme with the maximum
chance of success. A second element is the estimation of the likely impact of intended control operations on non-targets in these
highly sensitive environments. A pilot study may be required prior to the third and final stage, that of implementation and then
monitoring the effect of the programme on target pests, sympatric non-targets and the species that are the object of the
conservation effort. The anticoagulant rodenticide brodifacoum (trade names 'Klerat' and 'Talon') is used in conservation
projects worldwide. This paper puts forward general principles for adoption when employing this compound for conservation
and exemplifies the approach advocated with descriptions of a number of projects undertaken for the benefit of a variety of
endangered species. ","0507-6773

",,"BioMed Central
",,,,"Species of anopheline mosquitoes are largely distributed over emerged lands around the world and, within the tropics, few areas are without these insects, which are vectors of malaria parasites. Among the exceptions is the Seychelles archipelago in the western Indian Ocean. However, in the Aldabra island group, located in the extreme western portion of the archipelago, Anopheles gambiae s.l. was introduced, leading to massive proliferation and then elimination, with the most recent autochthonous malaria cases recorded in 1931. In order to re-examine the absence of anopheline mosquitoes in the Seychelles, an entomological field survey was conducted in December 2008 at 17 sites on four granitic islands, including Mahé and Praslin, and ten sites on coralline atolls in the extreme west, including Aldabra. No evidence of larval or adult anophelines was found at the surveyed sites, which supports their absence in the Seychelles. In the granitic islands of the Seychelles, the climate is favourable for anophelines. However, these islands are protected by their remoteness and prevailing seasonal winds. In addition, stagnant freshwater, required in anopheline larval development, is relatively uncommon on the granitic islands because of the steep slopes. In the southwestern atolls (Aldabra and Providence-Farquhar groups), the presence of a long dry season of up to nine months and the total absence of permanent natural freshwater prevents the breeding of anophelines and their successful colonization. The Seychelles does not have any native land mammals and like in other parts of the world (Antarctica, Iceland, New Caledonia, Central Pacific islands) their absence is associated with the lack of anophelines. This suggests an obligatory relationship for anophelines to feed on terrestrial mammals, without alternative for blood-feeding sources, such as bats, birds and reptiles.

The Andros Island collection represented nearly 50% (31 spp.) of the species known from the Bahamas, and increased the number of species known from Andros by over 70% (16 spp.).

Six species are new to the Bahamas and one species is a new record for the Caribbean region. Sixteen endemic species are present. Log species-log area relationships for the islands form a significant regression line as predicted by the equilibrium theory of island biogeography. Comparison of the distributions of Bahamian tree species and cerambycids is significant. It is likely that these phytophagous beetles followed the same dispersal pattern as trees. Since the Bahamas were entirely submerged in the Pliocene, the Bahamian cerambycid fauna (and all other terrestrial biotas) is predominantly the result of late Pleistocene and Recent Overwater dispersal from Cuba and secondarily from Hispaniola, and Florida.","0394-6975

",,,,"Interest in invasive species has increased around the world over the last several decades. In Mexico, studies on invasive species date as early as 1939 and the number of publications has increased considerably in recent decades. However, to our knowledge, the analysis of information gaps and research priorities is lacking. Therefore, it is necessary to identify gaps in the knowledge of invasive species in order to define future research priorities and focus conservation efforts. We assessed the current state of knowledge of biological invasions in Mexico based on the existing literature. Our aim was to identify in which areas information is absent or insufficient and which areas should be prioritised. We identified a total of 869 references. The number of references increased over time and the topics were strongly biased towards two areas: 1) natural history and geographical distribution patterns and 2) effects on native biota and ecosystems. The remaining topics were only moderately or poorly studied. Most studies focused on vascular plants (n = 280) and fishes (n = 174). Notably, a large portion of the references (n = 215) focused on only eight invasive alien species, including their ecological and socioeconomic impacts. Only 95 references examined the effects of alien species on biodiversity; these studies were mainly carried out on islands (n = 41) or in terrestrial or freshwater ecosystems in protected natural areas (n = 165). The findings of the present review can guide future studies in filling in the existing research gaps on biological invasions. Additionally, future studies should aim to define national priorities of the impacts of biological invasions and to promote the prevention and control of alien species by considering the distinct vectors and pathways of introduction and movement.

",,,,"To investigate the emergence and current situation of terrestrial rabies in Cuba, a collection of rabies virus specimens was employed for genetic characterization. These data supported the monophyletic nature of all terrestrial rabies viruses presently circulating in Cuba but additionally delineated several distinct variants exhibiting limited spatial distribution which may reflect the history of rabies spread on the island. The strain of rabies currently circulating in Cuba, which emerged on the island in the early 20th century, has very close evolutionary ties to the Mexican dog type and is a member of the cosmopolitan lineage widely distributed during the colonial period. The Cuban rabies viruses, which circulate predominantly within the mongoose population, are phylogenetically distant from viruses circulating in mongooses in other parts of the world. These studies illustrate, at a global level, the adaptation of multiple strains of rabies to mongoose species which should be regarded as important wildlife hosts for rabies re-emergence. Given the recent emergence of human cases due to bat contact in Cuba, this study also included a single insectivorous bat specimen which was found to most closely resemble the rabies viruses known to circulate in Mexican vampire bats.

",,,,"1. Many turtle species frequently suffer major injuries due to attempted predation or anthropogenic factors. Diamondback terrapins (Malaclemys terrapin) are one species known to be affected by anthropogenic activity, but little is known about the causes of injuries. In declining diamondback terrapin populations, learning more about causes and results of injuries can be helpful in developing sound management plans.

2.
Patterns of limb loss and major shell injuries were examined in a population of terrapins studied for 24 years at Kiawah Island, South Carolina to infer the causes and effects of injuries and possible predators on terrapins.

3.
The rate of shell injuries increased temporally, possibly as a result of increased watercraft activity. Because no differences in rates of limb loss were found between males and females, limb loss probably results from aquatic encounters (i.e. limb loss does not appear to be the result of terrestrial predation during nesting). Furthermore, males experienced reduced body condition when injured, and terrapins with a major injury had lower survivorship than uninjured terrapins.

4.
Therefore, in addition to reducing sources of mortality and protecting nesting habitat, measures to protect terrapins from watercraft activity may increase the survivorship of adult terrapins.","1052-7613

476.0,"Profuse evolutionary diversification and speciation on volcanic islands: transposon instability and amplification bursts explain the genetic paradox
","Craddock, Elysse",,Genetic algorithm,,,2016.0,,,,,,,,,,11,1,"Biology Direct
",,"BioMed Central
",,,,"Species-rich adaptive radiations arising from rare plant and animal colonizers are common on remote volcanic archipelagoes. However, they present a paradox. The severe genetic bottleneck of founder events and effects of inbreeding depression, coupled with the inherently stressful volcanic environment, would seem to predict reduced evolutionary potential and increased risk of extinction, rather than rapid adaptive divergence and speciation. Significantly, eukaryotic genomes harbor many families of transposable elements (TEs) that are mobilized by genome shock; these elements may be the primary drivers of genetic reorganization and speciation on volcanic islands. Here I propose that a central factor in the spectacular radiation and diversification of the endemic Hawaiian Drosophila and other terrestrial lineages on the Hawaiian and other oceanic islands has been repeated bursts of transposition of multiple TEs induced by the unique ecological features of volcanic habitats. Founder individuals and populations on remote volcanic islands experience significant levels of physiological and genomic stress as a consequence of both biotic and abiotic factors. This results in disruption of the usual epigenetic suppression of TEs, unleashing them to proliferate and spread, which in turn gives rise to novel genetic variation and remodels genomic regulatory circuits, facilitating rapid morphological, ecological and behavioral change, and adaptive radiation. To obtain empirical support for the hypothesis, test organisms should be exposed to prolonged heat stress, high levels of carbon dioxide and other volcanic gases, along with inbreeding. Data from subsequent whole genome sequencing and bioinformatics screening for TE numbers and locations would then be compared with initial pre-exposure TE information for the test strains, a labor-intensive project. Several predicted outcomes arising from the hypothesis are discussed. Currently available data are consistent with the proposed concept of stress-induced TE mobilization as a trigger of evolutionary diversification and speciation on volcanic islands. The main implication is that both TEs and species should proliferate at a much higher rate on volcanic islands than elsewhere. Second, the evolvability of a lineage may correlate with the abundance and distribution of TEs in the genome. Successful colonizers of volcanic habitats with high genomic proportions of TEs may be best poised to found a speciose lineage that gives rise to a dramatic adaptive radiation. Colonizers that are depauperate in TEs are likely to be evolutionarily constrained and diversify little, if at all.

",,,,"Only a handful of multi-generational experiments in natural systems of eco-evolutionary dynamics currently exist, despite Fussmann et al.'s call for more such studies nearly a decade ago. To perform such a study, in 2008 we introduced the lizard Leiocephalus carinatus, a predator (and possible food competitor) of the lizard Anolis sagrei, to seven islands having A. sagrei, with seven unmanipulated islands having A. sagrei as controls. Almost immediately, L. carinatus, which is larger and more terrestrial than A. sagrei, caused a major habitat shift in A. sagrei away from the ground and toward higher and thinner perches; focal behavioral surveys showed that on islands where its predator was introduced, A. sagrei had less conspicuous visual displays. The expected pattern for density of A. sagrei is that it would decrease markedly at first via predation from the larger lizard, but then it would increase as the habitat shift selected for individuals better able to live in higher vegetation. Data through 2015 show this pattern, but a return to previous densities (time-by-treatment interaction) was not yet significant. A previous within-generation selection study and comparative data suggest that short legs should evolve as the lizards adapt to better maneuver on the thin perches of higher vegetation. However, no indication of the expected morphological change in limb length was present through 2015. Previous studies showed A. sagrei producing many effects on lower levels of the food web, some quite large. In this study through 2012, we found significant differences only in spiders (web and ground). A possible complication is that the study site was hit by two major hurricanes in the last five years, decreasing population sizes of both lizard species and reducing the experimental perturbations. A benefit of the hurricanes, however, is that they eliminated lizards from some islands, providing the opportunity to monitor natural recolonization, the frequency of which has eco-evolutionary implications. Surveys of the 44 islands that lost lizards showed that recolonization is rather slow. To explore long-term patterns of morphological variation, we monitored morphology of 31 island populations for up to 19 years. Mean limb length oscillated across the 19-year period, both increasing and decreasing substantially, yet the net effect over that period is almost no change. In years following hurricanes, limb length increases significantly more than expected by chance.

",,,,"Species checklists are a fundamental component of biodiversity research. They foster understanding of species distributions and habitat preferences, thus reducing gaps of knowledge in geographical occurrences of species. Especially in light of the limited availability of data on species distributions for Tanah Papua, an increasing scientific focus on the region is crucial to foster and refine the knowledge of species occurrences and to inform potential conservation planning. Despite a strong focus on conservation of Raja Ampat´s marine areas, surprisingly few studies have focused on the terrestrial biodiversity of the archipelago. As a consequence, detailed species checklists are largely missing. Here, we provide a preliminary bird species checklist for the island of Gam and its surrounding islands, located in the central Raja Ampat archipelago. During nine sampling periods between 2013 and 2019, we recorded 132 bird species in six distinct habitat types. Of the detected species, six are considered threatened by IUCN Red List criteria. We further recorded three new species for Gam Island, thereby expanding their known extent of occurrence.

Biodiversitas 19: 1539-1551. Javan hawk-eagle (Nisaetus bartelsi) is an endemic raptor of Java Island. The conservation status of Javan hawk-eagle (JHE) according to IUCN is endangered (EN) and included in CITES Appendix II list, and this species is also protected by the Indonesian government law based on act no. 5, year 1990. The position of Javan hawk-eagle as a top predator is now very threatened by habitat fragmentation, wildlife trade, and the declining quality of its habitat. The primary purpose of this study was to give preliminary information about the distribution of predicted suitable habitat for JHE as a means of finding potential releasing sites, as an evaluation for habitat protection, and even as an option for the development of new JHE protected areas. However, mapping the spatial distribution of potential habitat for JHE using terrestrial survey is problematic because it requires enormous time, fund, and human resources. The most possible approach is by using Ecological Niche Modeling (ENM)/species distribution modeling (SDM). In this study, modeling exercise was conducted by using a maximum entropy method as an adaptation from Maxent software ver. 3.4.1, with the utilization of JHE-nest coordinate data and 16 environmental variables datasets as the main input. The predicted suitable habitat distribution map has shown a good match with historical and present records of JHE and has fairly succeeded in capturing a wide range of habitat patches from tiny spots to quite large suitable habitat. Modeling results also showed that altitude, annual mean temperature, and two types of land cover (closed shrub, and forest area) are considered to be most important variables affecting the distribution of potential habitat for JHE. Moreover, about 17.77% (23,209 km2) area of Java Island has been projected to be suitable for Havan Hawk-Eagle's habitat, which mostly spread in mountainous areas while also appear in several lowland areas. This study suggests the importance of topographic, climatic, and land cover as pivotal predictors in determining the suitability of habitat for JHE. This study also shows that the modeling results have a good match with the historical records of JHE across the island, which suggests the overall accuracy of the model.

",,,,"Soil nematodes are one of the most important terrestrial faunal groups in Antarctica, as they are a major component of soil micro-food webs. Despite their crucial role in soil processes, knowledge of their species diversity and distribution is still incomplete. Taxonomic studies of Antarctic nematodes are fragmented, which prevents assessment of the degree of endemicity and distribution of the species, as well as other aspects of biogeography.The present study is focused on the nematode fauna of one of the three Antarctic sub-regions, the Maritime Antarctic and summarises all findings published up to April 2023. A species list that includes 44 species, belonging to 21 genera, 16 families and eight orders is provided. A review of the literature on terrestrial nematodes inhabiting the Maritime Antarctic showed that the sites are unevenly studied. Three islands (Signy, King George and Livingston Islands) revealed highest species richness, probably due to the highest rates of research effort. Most species and four genera (Antarctenchus, Pararhyssocolpus, Amblydorylaimus and Enchodeloides) are endemic, proving that nematode fauna of the Maritime Antarctic is autochthonous and unique. Several groups of islands/sites have been revealed, based on their nematode fauna. The study showed that species with a limited distribution prevailed, while only two species (Plectusantarcticus and Coomansusgerlachei) have been found in more than 50% of the sites. Based on the literature data, details on species localities, microhabitat distribution, plant associations and availability of DNA sequences are provided.

",,,,"Abstract. We developed a high-resolution surface flux inversion system based on the global Eulerian–Lagrangian coupled tracer transport model composed of the National Institute for Environmental Studies (NIES) transport model (TM; collectively NIES-TM) and the FLEXible PARTicle dispersion model (FLEXPART). The inversion system is named NTFVAR (NIES-TM–FLEXPART-variational) as it applies a variational optimization to estimate surface fluxes. We tested the system by estimating optimized corrections to natural surface CO2 fluxes to achieve the best fit to atmospheric CO2 data collected by the global in situ network as a necessary step towards the capability of estimating anthropogenic CO2 emissions. We employed the Lagrangian particle dispersion model (LPDM) FLEXPART to calculate surface flux footprints of CO2 observations at a spatial resolution of 0.1∘×0.1∘. The LPDM is coupled with a global atmospheric tracer transport model (NIES-TM). Our inversion technique uses an adjoint of the coupled transport model in an iterative optimization procedure. The flux error covariance operator was implemented via implicit diffusion. Biweekly flux corrections to prior flux fields were estimated for the years 2010–2012 from in situ CO2 data included in the Observation Package (ObsPack) data set. High-resolution prior flux fields were prepared using the Open-Data Inventory for Anthropogenic Carbon dioxide (ODIAC) for fossil fuel combustion, the Global Fire Assimilation System (GFAS) for biomass burning, the Vegetation Integrative SImulator for Trace gases (VISIT) model for terrestrial biosphere exchange, and the Ocean Tracer Transport Model (OTTM) for oceanic exchange. The terrestrial biospheric flux field was constructed using a vegetation mosaic map and a separate simulation of CO2 fluxes at a daily time step by the VISIT model for each vegetation type. The prior flux uncertainty for the terrestrial biosphere was scaled proportionally to the monthly mean gross primary production (GPP) by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) MOD17 product. The inverse system calculates flux corrections to the prior fluxes in the form of a relatively smooth field multiplied by high-resolution patterns of the prior flux uncertainties for land and ocean, following the coastlines and fine-scale vegetation productivity gradients. The resulting flux estimates improved the fit to the observations taken at continuous observation sites, reproducing both the seasonal and short-term concentration variabilities including high CO2 concentration events associated with anthropogenic emissions. The use of a high-resolution atmospheric transport in global CO2 flux inversions has the advantage of better resolving the transported mixed signals from the anthropogenic and biospheric sources in densely populated continental regions. Thus, it has the potential to achieve better separation between fluxes from terrestrial ecosystems and strong localized sources, such as anthropogenic emissions and forest fires. Further improvements in the modelling system are needed as our posterior fit was better than that of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)'s CarbonTracker for only a fraction of the monitoring sites, i.e. mostly at coastal and island locations where background and local flux signals are mixed.

Recent monitoring studies suggest that these declines are still continuing; research to investigate causes (which is likely to reflect changes in the marine, rather than terrestrial environment) is a high priority.

We combined survey data from six habitats (Quill and Gilboa Hill, Town, Botanical Garden, Garden Road, and Venus Bay) on a small Lesser Antillean island over a seven-year period. Species abundance and richness varied among habitats, with Town having the highest species richness. Logistic regressions revealed significant differences among habitat and year (P = 0.008), but not foraging guild, season, rainfall or elevation (P > 0.05). The Quill (P = 0.0003) and Town (P = 0.001) differed significantly from the other habitats surveyed. Granivorous + frugivorous and omnivorous species were most commonly detected in the Quill, whereas nectarivores and granivores were most commonly detected in Town. The influence of total annual precipitation on bird detection rates was unsubstantial. However, site-specific climate data for the different habitats are not available. Though resident landbird populations on St. Eustatius were stable over the survey period, we recommend that annual monitoring continue in the same habitats, especially following extensive vegetation damage caused by hurricanes Irma and Maria in September 2017 and in light of predicted global climate change. The results of our monitoring proved useful in evaluating protected areas and Important Bird Areas compared with non-protected areas. We encourage island researchers and conservation stewards to initiate similar long-term monitoring in order to determine the status of their resident landbird populations.","0008-6452

",,,,"Abstract Biodiversity knowledge is widely heterogeneous across the Earth's biomes. Some areas, due to their remoteness and difficult access, present large taxonomic knowledge gaps. Mostly located in the tropics, these areas have frequently experienced a fast development of anthropogenic activities during the last decades and are therefore of high conservation concerns. The biodiversity hotspots of Southeast Asia exemplify the stakes faced by tropical countries. While the hotspots of Sundaland (Java, Sumatra, Borneo) and Wallacea (Sulawesi, Moluccas) have long attracted the attention of biologists and conservationists alike, extensive parts of the Sahul area, in particular the island of New Guinea, have been much less explored biologically. Here, we describe the results of a DNA‐based inventory of aquatic and terrestrial vertebrate communities, which was the objective of a multidisciplinary expedition to the Bird's Head Peninsula (West Papua, Indonesia) conducted between 17 October and 20 November 2014. This expedition resulted in the assembly of 1005 vertebrate DNA barcodes. Based on the use of multiple species‐delimitation methods (GMYC, PTP, RESL, ABGD), 264 molecular operational taxonomic units (MOTUs) were delineated, among which 75 were unidentified and an additional 48 were considered cryptic. This study suggests that the diversity of vertebrates of the Bird's Head is severely underestimated and considerations on the evolutionary origin and taxonomic knowledge of these biotas are discussed.

The highest molecular diversity of cyanobacterial communities was found in the areas located between 70° S and 80° S. Further south and further north from this zone, the diversity abruptly decreased. Seventy-nine per cent (33 of 42 operational taxonomic units) of Antarctic terrestrial cyanobacteria have a cosmopolitan distribution. Analysis of the sampling efforts shows that only three regions (southern Victoria Land, the Sør Rondane Mountains and Alexander Island) have been particularly well studied, while other areas did not receive enough attention. Although cyanobacteria possess a capacity for long-range transport, regional populations in Antarctic ice-free areas seem to exist. The cyanobacterial communities of the three most intensively studied regions, separated from each other by a distance of 3000–3400 km, had a low degree of similarity with each other. Further development of microbial biogeography demands a standardized approach. For this purpose, as a minimal standard, we suggest using the sequence of cyanobacterial 16S rRNA gene between Escherichia coli positions 405 and 780.

",,,,"Abstract Terrestrial vegetation communities across Antarctica are characteristically sparse, presenting a challenge for mapping their occurrence using remote sensing at the continent scale. At present there is no continent-wide baseline record of Antarctic vegetation, and large-scale area estimates remain unquantified. With local vegetation distribution shifts now apparent and further predicted in response to environmental change across Antarctica, it is critical to establish a baseline to document these changes. Here we present a 10 m-resolution map of photosynthetic life in terrestrial and cryospheric habitats across the entire Antarctic continent, maritime archipelagos and islands south of 60° S. Using Sentinel-2 imagery (2017–2023) and spectral indices, we detected terrestrial green vegetation (vascular plants, bryophytes, green algae) and lichens across ice-free areas, and cryospheric green snow algae across coastal snowpacks. The detected vegetation occupies a total area of 44.2 km 2 , with over half contained in the South Shetland Islands, altogether contributing just 0.12% of the total ice-free area included in the analysis. Due to methodological constraints, dark-coloured lichens and cyanobacterial mats were excluded from the study. This vegetation map improves the geospatial data available for vegetation across Antarctica, and provides a tool for future conservation planning and large-scale biogeographic assessments.

Taxa previously recognised in New Zealand's naturalised fauna and confirmed in this study are (with recommended common names): Agriolimacidae - Deroceras laeve (marsh slug), D. panormitanum (brown field slug), D. reticulatum (grey field slug); Arionidae - Arion hortensis (Férussac's orange soled slug), A. intermedius (glade slug); Cochlicopidae - Cochlicopa lubrica (slippery moss snail); Ferussaciidae - Cecilioides acicula (blind pin snail); Helicidae - Cantareus aspersus (brown garden snail); Hygromiidae - Candidula intersecta (wrinkled snail); Limacidae - Lehmannia nyctelia (Bourguignat's slug), Limacus flavus (yellow cellar slug), Limax maximus (tiger slug); Milacidae - Milax gagates (jet slug), Tandonia budapestensis (Budapest slug), T. sowerbyi (Sowerby's slug); Pupillidae - Lauria cylindracea (chrysalis snail); Testacellidae - Testacella haliotidea (shelled slug); Valloniidae - Vallonia excentrica (eccentric grass snail); Vertiginidae - Vertigo ovata (grassland whorl snail); Zonitidae - Oxychilus alliarius (garlic glass snail), O. cellarius (cellar glass snail), O. draparnaudi (Drapamaud's glass snail), Vitrea crystallina (crystal snail). Consistent with recent revisions, several generic-species epithet combinations are applied for the first time to the New Zealand naturalised fauna: these include Cantareus aspersus (formerly in genus Helix); Limacus flavus (formerly in Limax(Limacus) or Lehmannia); Tandonia budapestensis and T. sowerbyi (formerly Milax).

Arion distinctus (Arionidae) (Mabille's orange soled slug) is shown to have been long established and widespread in New Zealand, but previously not recognised as a component of A. hortensis s.l. Zonitoides arboreus (Zonitidae) (orchid snail) is formally recorded as a naturalised species, although its presence since the 1950s has been recognised in the popular press and unpublished plant protection records. Helicodiscus singleyanus (Helicodiscidae) (Singley's subterranean discus snail) is recorded in the naturalised fauna for the first time with recognition of the presumedly indigenous species Hydrophrea academia as a new junior synonym; this small, largely subterranean species has been known from widely scattered localities since 1970. Lehmannia valentiana (Limacidae) (Valencia slug) is recorded in New Zealand for the first time, although specimen material indicates that it has been established at various localities in the North Island since the 1970s. Prietocella barbara (Hygromiidae) (banded conical snail) is formally added to the naturalised fauna, although its establishment was recorded in 1983 but not published; this species is rapidly spreading through northernmost New Zealand. Coneuplecta calculosa (Euconulidae) (calculus cone snail) is the species most recently confirmed (1995) as a naturalisation, and is known at present from a single locality.

Family and generic diagnoses are presented; these were initially developed from the literature, but incorporate much new anatomical observation. All species are redescribed and illustrated on the basis of conchological and anatomical observations of New Zealand and extralimital material, with new or corrected anatomical data, and haploid chromosome numbers taken from the literature. The systematic status of each species is discussed, and information is presented on their distribution, history in New Zealand, and biology. A key to their identification is included. Methods for collection, preparation, and curation of these molluscs are briefly outlined. The systematic treatment of the taxa and the key are supported by a comprehensive description and discussion of the body plan and organ systems in Stylommatophora that are important in systematics and in taxon recognition. Most species are illustrated from life in a series of colour plates.

",,,,"The pioneer studies of Skottsberg (1912), supported by the observations of Bertram (1938) and Bryant (1945), showed that a range of bryophyte and lichen communities are developed in many localities along the west coast of the Antarctic Peninsula and on its offshore islands. In contrast, the terrestrial vegetation over much of the Antarctic continent is apparently restricted to sparse, widely scattered communities of lichens, with mosses playing only a subordinate role, particularly in inland areas (Siple 1938; Rudolph 1963; Greene 1964). Holdgate (1964) thus proposed a division of the Antarctic botanical zone into Maritime and Continental areas, the former having an oceanic rather than a continental climate, and supporting liverworts and two species of vascular plants in addition to well-developed moss and lichen communities. The Maritime area, which can thus be characterized in vegetational and floristic terms, has yet to be clearly defined geographically, but extends over much of the Scotia Ridge-Antarctic Peninsula sector. The present paper aims at giving a preliminary account of the vegetation in this area, based on observations made in a variety of localities from Candlemas Island south to Neny Island. The distribution of these sites is indicated in figure 17, and the extent of observations at each locality has been described elsewhere (Longton 1966 #). Because of taxonomic difficulties a detailed analysis of the vegetation in each area was impracticable, since many of the taxa can at present be named only to the generic level (Greene 1964). The major divisions of the vegetation have been defined, however, and their distribution is discussed in relation to climatic, edaphic and biotic factors, enabling an attempt to be made at outlining the geographical boundaries of the Maritime Antarctic.

",,,,"Abstract Aim The Indonesian island of Sulawesi is home to thousands of endemic terrestrial animal species. Phylogeographical studies of some of these taxa revealed concordant distribution patterns (areas of endemism; AoEs), suggestive of a shared evolutionary or ecological mechanism driving divergence among various terrestrial taxa. Generally, AoEs have been attributed to Pleistocene marine incursions, geological fault zones and Sulawesi's history as an archipelago. We test, for the first time, the hypothesis that population divergences are associated with unsuitable climate spaces at the boundaries between these areas. Location Sulawesi, Indonesia. Taxon Maxomys musschenbroekii , a common murid rodent endemic to Sulawesi. Methods We sequenced a mitochondrial gene, four nuclear protein‐coding genes and hundreds of ultraconserved elements from individuals sampled across the island, which we used to build intraspecific phylogenies and identify population structure. To test climate‐related hypotheses, we used multiple regression to assess the extent to which genetic distances, over‐land geographical distances, environmental distances (derived from ecological niche model resistance surfaces) and areas of endemism are correlated. Results In all three genetic datasets, we inferred phylogeographical structure that is geographically concordant with previously defined AoEs. Ecological niche models showed a similar geography of suitability across the island since the Last Glacial Maximum, with varying levels of unsuitable climate space between AoEs. Genetic distances were more strongly correlated with environmental distances than geographical distances and interspecific divergences arose just in the past 1.5 Myr. Main Conclusions Population divergences within M. musschenbroekii are consistent with AoE definitions from other taxa. Stable areas of unsuitable habitat near AoE boundaries probably supplemented marine incursions in generating population structure within M. musschenbroekii and other co‐distributed species.

",,,,"Flying-foxes and smaller, insectivorous bats, as well as birds, frogs, lizards, rodents and humans, are among Holocene vertebrate remains recovered from a cave near Mé Auré on the central southwestern coast of Grande Terre, the main island of New Caledonia, southwest Pacific. New Caledonia is one of the world’s most critically endangered biodiversity hotspots whose native terrestrial mammals consist of nine bat species, six of which are endemic. The Mé Auré Cave deposit accumulated over a period of some 3000 years, from before colonization of the area by people to the present. In the deposit’s upper levels, bat remains approximate the modern New Caledonian fauna – with the notable exception of the first record of a leaf-nosed bat from these islands – and probably represent bats that lived and died in the cave as well as those brought in as prey by barn owls. In the lowest levels, only flying-foxes are represented, their corroded teeth and other evidence suggesting they were cooked and eaten by people. Our data indicate that at least one insectivorous bat species has become extinct during the last 250 years in New Caledonia. Alternatively, it is possible that this leaf-nosed bat continues to be part of the threatened extant New Caledonian bat fauna but has yet to be recorded by modern faunal surveys.","0959-6836

",,,,"We describe the nest-site characteristics and breeding habitat use of Kelp Geese (Chloephaga hybrida) and Flightless Steamer-Ducks (Tachyeres pteneres) along 137 km of coastline on the northern shore of the Beagle Channel, Argentina, and 87 km of island coastline. We examined the importance of vegetation cover, predation, and tourism on the distribution of nests among islands. We found all nests only on islands and islets. Nesting sites for both species were strongly associated with higher proportions of high vegetation cover (shrubs). Kelp Geese were also associated with the absence of terrestrial predators. Tourist presence on islands was not associated with the occurrence of nests for either species. The northern coasts of the Beagle Channel and the islands and islets along the channel have similar habitat types. However, the islands and islets are relatively inaccessible to mammalian terrestrial predators compared to the coast of the channel where terrestrial predators are frequently recorded. Therefore, islands and islets seem to provide a relatively safe nesting habitat for Kelp Geese and Flightless Steamer-Ducks by offering refuge mainly from ground predators. Additionally, habitat changes caused by increased human disturbance along the northern shore of the Beagle Channel may also explain the presence of nests only on islands and islets, though further studies are needed to assess these effects. This study contributes new information on the breeding habitat and nesting sites of Flightless Steamer-Ducks and Kelp Geese in the Beagle Channel, to assist in the identification of priority breeding sites and habitats to protect. Also, it highlights the importance of islands and islets of the Beagle Channel as safe breeding refuge for these two ground nesting seabirds.

",,,,"Species with cryptic origins (i.e. those that cannot be reliably classed as native or non-native) present a particular challenge to our understanding of the generation and maintenance of biodiversity. Such species may be especially common on islands given that some islands have had a relatively recent history of human settlement. It is likely that select island species considered native might have achieved their current distributions via direct or indirect human actions. As an example, we explore the origins of eastern bluebirds (Sialia sialis bermudensis) on the island of Bermuda. Considered native to the island and a distinct subspecies, this population has diverged in morphology relative to mainland North America. Using microsatellite markers and simulation of island colonization, we show that the Bermuda population of bluebirds is the likely result of a single colonization event that occurred during the 1600s, making this a cryptic invader. To our knowledge, this is one of the youngest examples of a terrestrial vertebrate cryptic invader. We suggest that the eastern bluebird is not an isolated case of cryptic invader on either Bermuda or elsewhere and that caution be exercised when studying present-day distributions of organisms.","0962-1083

Its rain forests are also home to some rare species such as some Aërides sp., Bulbophyllum sp., Cymbidium sp., Dendrobium sp., Dimorphorchis sp., Grammatophyllum sp., Paphiopedilum sp., Phalaenopsis sp., Paraphalaenopsis sp., and Vanda sp., all of which have a very high economic value. These species are endangered and some of them may have not yet been found or discovered, because of the loss of habitat resulting from fire, forest damage, illegal logging, and orchid hunting either by domestic or foreign collectors. Until recently, there are only a few records on the orchid native to West Borneo. For this reason, a research was conducted to identify and create an inventory of all orchid species that exist in West Borneo before they become extinct along with their habitat and to conserve them ex situ. This research was conducted in 10 counties and one municipal city in West Borneo, and inventory was done through exploration. Orchids found were recorded and identified into their genera and their species by visual examination of vegetative and floral characteristics, respectively. A total of 197 species of orchids from 66 genera were identified, and among those, 27 species live as terrestrials, 169 species live as epiphytes, and one species lives as both an epiphyte and terrestrial.

",,,,"Abstract. A survey of the natural environment was undertaken in Shetland in 1974, after concern was expressed that large-scale development from the new oil industry could threaten the natural features of the islands. A framework was constructed by the Institute of Terrestrial Ecology on which to select samples for the survey. The vegetation and habitat data that were collected, along with the sampling framework, have recently been made public via the following doi:10.5285/06fc0b8c-cc4a-4ea8-b4be-f8bd7ee25342 (Terrestrial habitat, vegetation and soil data from Shetland, 1974) and doi:10.5285/f1b3179e-b446-473d-a5fb-4166668da146 (Land Classification of Shetland 1974). In addition to providing valuable information about the state of the natural environment of Shetland, the repeatable and statistically robust methods developed in the survey were used to underpin the Countryside Survey, Great Britain's national long-term integrated environmental monitoring programme. The demonstration of the effectiveness of the methodology indicates that a repeat of the Shetland survey would yield statistics about ecological changes in the islands, such as those arising from the impacts of the oil industry, a range of socio-economic impacts, and perhaps climate change. Currently no such figures are available, although there is much information on the sociological impacts, as well as changes in agriculture.

",,,,"Socorro Island, in the Revillagigedo Archipelago, has the highest number of endemisms of any Mexican island. It provides habitat for 117 vascular plants, 26 % of which are endemic to the island. Also endemic to the island are one reptile and eight terrestrial bird species. However, the local ecosystem has been heavily degraded by exotic mammals over the past 140 years. The feral sheep (Ovis aries) has contributed to a 30% loss in habitat based on the island's surface area. Another serious threat is the feral cat (Felis catus), which has severely impacted the island's bird communities and the endemic Socorro tree lizard (Urosaurus auriculatus). Together, feral sheep and cats are responsible for the extinction in the wild of the Socorro dove (Zenaida graysoni) and the Socorro Elf Owl (Micrathene whitneyi graysoni), and pose a serious threat for other vulnerable species, such as the Townsend's shearwater (Puffinus auricularis). The feral sheep was completely eradicated in 2012, which resulted in a rapid and remarkable recovery of the local vegetation cover. The eradication of the feral cat has been a complex issue to undertake due to the large size and topographical complexity of Socorro Island. In 2011 Grupo de Ecología y Conservacion de Islas, A. C. (GECI) started a feral cat control program, which scaled up into an eradication campaign. Here we report on the progress of the eradication campaign between 2011 and 2015, and provide a first assessment of the recovery of the native fauna. Beginning in 2011, camera traps were used to estimate cat abundance. Leg-hold and lethal traps were used to capture feral cats, some of them mounted with telemetry devices that alerted when traps were activated. Native vertebrates were monitored to confirm the positive effects derived from cat control efforts. By July 2015, 413 cats were dispatched using soft leg-hold and lethal traps, with a combined effort of 22,706 trap-nights. To date (mid-2016), cat abundance has decreased significantly, with cats being completely absent for several years in different areas of the island. The abundance of the endemic Socorro Island tree lizard and terrestrial birds has increased thanks to significant progress. Completing this important conservation action requires an increase in trapping efforts and the use of detection dogs, combined with night hunting. We estimate that the eradication of the feral cat will be completed by early 2017, after which the absence confirmation phase will begin.

",,,,"Mining appears to represent an important threat to conservation efforts in Madagascar. Expanding mining activities on the island have the potential to provide revenue for development and conservation efforts, but also pose a potential threat to conservation efforts on the island due to the spatial distribution and extent of mining concessions and the environmental impacts that mines often cause. By measuring the extent of overlap of permitted mining concessions with protected areas, potential protected areas, and mining - exclusion zones on the island, we assessed potential effects of mining on terrestrial conservation and evaluated the success of the governing institutions in limiting that impact. Permitted mining areas in 2006 overlapped with protected areas, potential protected areas, and mining - exclusion zones on the island. Mining concession areas overlapped with 33 % of surface area planned for protection in 2005, 21 % of surface area planned for protection in 2006, and 12 % of the surface area from which mining was to be legally excluded. Total permitted area and area of overlap with conservation areas increased between 2005 and 2006 despite efforts in 2004 to limit such overlap. Changes in the mining permitting and regulation could improve prospects for limiting the impact of mining on biodiversity conservation on the island.

Biological invasion costs were split relatively evenly between aquatic (US$ 1.16 billion; $MXN 21.95 billion) and terrestrial (US$ 1.17 billion; $MXN 22.14 billion) invaders, but semi-aquatic taxa dominated (US$ 2.99 billion; $MXN 56.57 billion), with costs from damages to resources four times higher than those from management of IAS (US$ 4.29 billion vs. US$ 1.04 billion; $MXN 81.17 billion vs $MXN 19.68 billion). The agriculture sector incurred the highest costs (US$ 1.01 billion; $MXN 19.1 billion), followed by fisheries (US$ 517.24 million; $MXN 9.79 billion), whilst most other costs simultaneously impacted mixed or unspecified sectors. When defined, costs to Mexican natural protected areas were mostly associated with management actions in terrestrial environments, and were incurred through official authorities via monitoring, control or eradication. On natural protected islands, mainly mammals were managed (i.e. rodents, cats and goats), to a total of US$ 3.99 million, while feral cows, fishes and plants were mostly managed in protected mainland areas, amounting to US$ 1.11 million in total. Pterygoplichthys sp. and Eichhornia crassipes caused the greatest reported costs in unprotected aquatic ecosystems in Mexico, and Bemisia tabaci to terrestrial systems. Although reported damages from invasions appeared to be fluctuating through time in Mexico, management spending has been increasing. These estimates, albeit conservative, underline the monetary pressure that invasions put on the Mexican economy, calling for urgent actions alongside comprehensive cost reporting in national states such as Mexico.

",,,,"Haemadipsidae is a clade of notorious bloodfeeding annelids adapted to tropical and sub-tropical rainforests found throughout the Indo-Pacific. This family traditionally includes duognathous (two-jawed) endemics, each placed in their own genus, from continental and volcanic islands including: Australia, Indonesia, Madagascar, Papua New Guinea, Philippines, Seychelles, and South Pacific islands, while trignathous (three-jawed) Tritetrabdella species and the speciose Haemadipsa are exclusive to the Indian subcontinent ranging into east and south-east Asia. One of the more compelling aspects of haemadipsids is their distribution on post-Gondwanan landmasses. In this study, the phylogenetic relationships, taxonomy and biogeographic patterns of Haemadipsidae were examined. Over 5 kb of sequence data from three genes (nuclear 18S rDNA and 28S rDNA and mitochondrial COI) for 37 haemadipsid exemplars, representing 12 of the 15 recognised genera, were analysed under the criteria of maximum parsimony and Bayesian inference. The results show that widespread duognathous species form a monophyletic group derived from trignathous ancestry and are sister to a new trignathous clade for Haemadipsidae. This phylogenetic hypothesis rejected Gondwanan vicariance as an explanation for the diversification of haemadipsids. Haemadipsidae is accepted as the formal name for these Indo-Pacific leeches. Whereas the subdivisions Haemadipsinae and Domanibdellinae are clarified, there is a need to establish a new subfamily, Tritetrabdellinae, for the newly identified trignathous clade that is sister to Domanibdellinae. This study provides a basis for continued elucidation of the evolutionary relationships and classification of these terrestrial annelids.

",,,,"Remote oceanic islands have high potential to harbor unique fauna and flora, but opportunities to conduct in-depth biotic surveys are often limited. Furthermore, underrepresentation of existing biodiversity in the literature has the potential to detract from conservation planning and action. Between 18 and 29 October 2018, we surveyed the terrestrial vertebrates of East Rennell, a UNESCO World Heritage Site in Solomon Islands. We documented 56 species, including 15 squamates, 13 mammals, and 38 birds, and present four new vertebrate records for the island: Stephan's emerald dove (Chalcophaps stephani), Maluku myotis (Myotis moluccarum), littoral skink (Emoia atrocostata) and brahminy blindsnake (Indotyphlops braminus). East Rennell was designated a World Heritage site for its significant on-going ecological and biological processes, and importance for the study of island biogeography. The new records presented here provide evidence that continued field studies combined with DNA analysis will continue to uncover even greater endemic biodiversity. Rennell is currently experiencing major habitat destruction in parts of the island that are not under World Heritage protection, and we anticipate collateral damage will likely extend into protected areas. Our survey also underscores the incredible vertebrate biodiversity that stands to be lost unless conservation actions and local community needs are intertwined to promote beneficial outcomes on both fronts.

Five priority watersheds within the SINP were surveyed for the post biological assessment. These were the watersheds of Taft, Can-avid, Basey, Suribao and Catubig. Standard faunal survey methods such as transect survey, mist netting, and trapping were used during the entire duration of the study. The methods were augmented with ocular observations and ethnobiological interviews. Of the 182 species of terrestrial vertebrates recorded from SINP, 121 species were birds, 20 were mammals, 18 amphibians and 23 reptiles. The overall endemism is 40%. The 121 species of birds belong to 15 orders and 45 families. Of these, 26% are endemic to the Philippinesand 12% are endemic to the greater Mindanao faunal region. Among avian species, thirteen (11%) are considered threatened or at risk. Of the 11 mammals, which belong to 6 orders and 9 families, 45% are endemic to the country and 15% are endemic to the greater Mindanao faunal region. Seven (35%) of these species are considered threatened or at risk. Of the 18 species of amphibians recorded, 2 are introduced and the rest are native to the Philippines. Of the 23 reptiles, 39% are endemic to the country and 3% are endemic to the greater Mindanao faunal region. Among herpetofauna, only one species is considered threatened or at risk. Samar holds high diversity and high endemism and contains a remarkable number of threatened species being recognized by the international arena in biological diversity conservation, most of which have strong affinity to the Mindanao faunal region. The existing data are sufficient to further highlight the need to establish SINP as conservation priority site in the region.

",,,,"In Mexico, wildlife conservation and management is officially based on two schemes: Natural Protected Areas (ANP, in Spanish), and Wildlife Conservation, Management and Sustainable Utilization Units (UMA). In this paper we evaluated whether these areas satisfy a minimum critical area (MCA) to support theoretical values of minimum viable population (MVP) of white-tailed deer, Odocoileus virginianus. MCAs were estimated using a model based on population density values from 1 to 30 deer/km 2 . MCA increased as density decreased. Results suggest an MCA of 1,667 to 50,000 ha to support an MVP of 500 deer, or 16,670 to 500,000 ha for long-term viability of 5,000 deer, depending on regional deer density. Biosphere Reserves, Protection Areas of Flora and Fauna, and Protection Areas of Natural Resources satisfy MCA requirements better than other ANP categories. In general, almost no UMA cover MCA. Geographic distribution of larger ANP and UMA are biased towards the North and Southeast of Mexico. We also evaluated the proposal of Priority Terrestrial Regions (RTP), and found that these areas could better satisfy MCA requirements; particularly, RTP could complement the need for reserves in the central part of the country. Selected study cases were used to illustrate the utility of this model to evaluate specific locations to know if MCA requirements are satisfied to support MVP of this deer. We suggest a regional network system of conservation reserves and wildlife management units integrating ANP, UMA, and RTP at regional scale, through source-sink and archipelago reserve models.

",,,,"The dispersal abilities of terrestrial mammals are severely constrained by water crossings, resulting in islands generally supporting less diverse mammal faunas than similar continental areas. In ice-affected Arctic regions, seasonal or permanent ice cover provides a bridging mechanism for dispersal, allowing water gaps to be crossed more rapidly and with less energy cost than is entailed in swimming. Consequently, islands that might be out of reach if waters were open become much more readily colonised in the presence of ice. We reviewed the distribution of terrestrial mammals on selected islands throughout the Arctic and analyse historical data for several sites in the Canadian Arctic where mammal populations have undergone extirpation and re-colonisation. We use these data to assess the value of ice for the dispersal of Arctic terrestrial mammals. Given observed dispersal distances we estimate the likely impact of future ice reduction on island faunas. We predict that, as ice cover duration shortens, immigration will decline leading to increased extinctions of island populations and potentially, in the long-term, local genetic differentiation. The eventual disappearance of ice bridges, preventing the immigration of southern species, may leave certain arctic archipelagos as the last refuge for typical Arctic mammals.","1488-8386

Overall, 131 terrestrial gastropods were collected in winter/spring season 2018/2019 and examined for the presence of metastrongyloid lungworm larvae via artificial digestion. The current data revealed a total prevalence of 4.6% for A. vasorum, 3.8% for A. abstrusus and 0.8% for A. cantonensis. In Tenerife, three lungworm species were detected, thereby re-confirming A. cantonensis endemicity for this island. Prevalences of snails (C. aspersum) originating from El Hierro were 5% for A. abstrusus and 15% for A. vasorum, respectively, with larval burdens up to 290 larvae per specimen. This epidemiological study indicates the presence of human, canine and feline lungworm species in Macaronesia, Spain. The current data-particularly those on anthropozoonotic A. cantonensis-call for a regular large-scale monitoring on intermediate hosts, paratenic hosts and definitive hosts to prevent further spread of lungworm-related diseases in humans and animals.

Phylogenetic analysis based on 55 adult morphological characters affirms that this endemic hydrophilid fauna is a monophyletic clade that incorporates the first well-supported transformation from an aquatic to terrestrial way of life within any lineage of the subfamily Hydrophilinae. The clade is prescribed to the genus Limnoxenus Motschulsky, where described members were previously placed. Five new species are described: L. waialeale sp.n. (Kauai), L. kauaiensis sp.n. (Kauai), L. oahuensis sp.n. (Oahu), L. punctatostriatus sp.n. (Kauai) and L. namolokama sp.n. (Kauai). Lectotypes are designated for the two previously described species L. semicylindricus (Eschscholtz) and L. nesiticus (Sharp). The Hawaiian lineage is a component of a larger clade that also includes the remaining four species of Limnoxenus from Europe, South Africa, and Australia, plus the monotypic genera Limnocyclus Balfour-Browne of New Caledonia and Hydramara Knisch of South America. The majority of the Hawaiian species exhibit vestigial wings, an extremely unusual condition in aquatic beetles. No other island-endemic members of the Hydrophilinae are known to be flightless, suggesting insularity per se is not responsible for this condition. L. nesiticus of Oahu has not been collected during the past 106 years, suggesting that it has been lost to anthropogenically mediated extinction.","0307-6970

",,,,"The vulnerability of less developed regions is exacerbated by a lack of information to inform appropriate adaptation planning. We addressed this challenge in the islands of Lombok and Sumbawa (Nusa Tenggara Barat Province, Indonesia) by combining multiple sources of knowledge to develop a typology of natural resource use by communities of the province. This enabled an assessment of future impacts of drivers of change such as population growth and climate change. The typology was developed by cluster analysis of an inventory of the use of ecosystem goods and services (EGS) by the 105 rural subdistricts in the province. The data were largely elicited from expert knowledge, augmented by a rapid rural appraisal of communities' marine resource use in Sumbawa. Exploratory analysis of existing secondary data on livelihoods and land use provided context and skeleton data, which were developed further by experts. Overall, 82 EGS were identified from nine terrestrial, coastal, marine and freshwater habitats. EGS included livestock, cropping, forestry, wildlife hunting, fishing, aquaculture, mining, water (for drinking and agriculture) and tourism. The typology comprised seven types that captured 42% of the variation in the data matrix. The types were moderately spatially aggregated and showed some congruence with administrative (district) boundaries. We discuss the implications of the results for planning livelihood adaptation strategies, and out-scaling these among subdistricts of matching types.

526.0,"Understanding seabird responses to invasive mammal eradications from islands needs systematic monitoring
","Towns, David",,,,,2018.0,,,15,16,,,,,,21,1,"Animal Conservation
",,"Wiley
",,,,"The recent review of global responses by seabirds to eradications of invasive mammals from islands (Brooke et al., 2017) is a valuable synthesis, and follows a more general account of the responses of a range of terrestrial groups (Jones et al., 2016). However, as Brooke et al. (2017) emphasize, the focus on seabirds provides insights into their behaviour, their capacity for recolonization, and the speed at which recolonization may progress. This focus on seabirds is crucial. As ecosystem drivers (engineers), seabird recovery should provide a platform for other responses in island ecosystems (e.g. Mulder et al., 2011), with indirect effects that can even flow into invertebrate food webs (Thoresen et al., 2017). The review also gives cause to re-examine general theories about seabird behaviour. The unexpectedly rapid recolonization provides evidence that many seabird species are less philopatric to natal breeding sites than previously predicted. Furthermore, a pool of immature birds may be constantly prospecting for new sites, enabling them to rapidly take advantage of newly provided predator-free habitats (Brooke et al., 2017). These findings identify the need for a more nuanced view of potential seabird colonization, since dispersal behaviour now appears to vary between and perhaps within families. Beyond seabird behaviour, the study by Brooke et al. (2017) reveals a fundamental problem deserving further consideration: deficiencies with outcome monitoring. The authors note that monitoring of the responses of resident species, particularly seabirds, following invasive species removals is sporadic. The plea by these authors to fund more systematic monitoring of seabird populations points to a larger problem revealed through the global study by Jones et al. (2016). Of >700 islands from which eradications of invasive mammals have been attempted, Jones and her co-authors were able to obtain information on responses, either positive or negative, by any native species for only 181 (26%). Many of these eradications may be too recent to reveal measurable responses. Nonetheless, the above study demonstrates that poorly studied and reported eradication outcomes are a global problem. For example, the New Zealand Department of Conservation has been developing mammal eradication tools for >30 years, with 134 islands now cleared of invasive mammals (Parkes et al., 2017). In my experience as project manager or compliance advisor, or through post-eradication monitoring and restoration for 20 of these islands, biological and financial impediments to reporting eradication outcomes include: (1) unmeasurable claims of potential responses by target species; (2) assumptions that positive outcomes at one locality will repeat on those nearby, even when communities differ; (3) slow maturing target species such as seabirds and tuatara Sphenodon punctatus for which measurable responses may take almost a decade (e.g. Towns et al., 2007); (4) logistic challenges (cost) of reaching remote locations; and (5) unavailability of economical ways to measure the speed and scale of changes at the ecosystem level (but see Jones, 2010). For pragmatic reasons, the focus has just been on threatened species, which may have tagged funding, and not on ecosystem drivers such as seabirds if they are not threatened. For example, of the above 20 islands, seabird recovery was a specified goal for the eradication of feral cats Felis catus and rats Rattus exulans for just one (Te Hauturu-o-Toi; Griffiths et al., unpublished). On the remaining 19 islands, the primary justification for the eradications involved terrestrial species under threat. Even monitoring the recovery of target species on at least three of these islands succumbed to tight budgets. Significant changes to many communities and ecosystems are thus almost certainly unreported. Likely benefits from the earliest eradications, particularly of rats, were previously unclear. Such is not the case now. Today, it should be possible – and arguably imperative – to develop projects with clear goals outlined before the eradications, and monitoring designed to test these goals. Eradication experiences on hundreds of islands can now contribute to predicting likely outcomes for native species. If monitoring costs were built into eradication campaigns, the information gained would then support additional projects (Brooke et al., 2017). Unfortunately, any monitoring funds allocated by government departments are likely to be vulnerable to election cycles shorter than the life span of many species. Nonetheless, studies such as those by Brooke et al. (2017) identify what is possible and the factors to consider when monitoring post-eradication recovery. In sum, the sporadic monitoring reported by these authors contributes to other problems: lack of data or incentive to report responses to eradications and patchy understanding of what invasive mammal eradications can achieve. Nonetheless, theirs is another paper that demonstrates the insights derived from studying island ecosystems as they recover from mammal invasions.

",,,,"PREMISE OF THE STUDY:
To enhance our knowledge of the diversity of microalgae, a phycological survey of the Canary Islands (Spain) was undertaken. Here we report the discovery of a (semi)terrestrial green filamentous alga isolated from a steep volcanic canyon on La Palma. This alga is continually exposed to changing weather conditions (floods vs. droughts) and thus provides a good opportunity to investigate possible adaptations to a semiterrestrial habitat with large fluctuations of environmental parameters.

METHODS:
We used axenic cultures, simulated flood and drought stresses and studied their effect on the life history of the alga using light, confocal laser scanning and scanning electron microscopy including fluorescent staining. Furthermore, phylogenetic analyses using rDNA sequence comparisons were performed.

KEY RESULTS:
Three specific life-history traits that likely represent adaptations to the fluctuating environment of the canyon were observed: (1) fragmentation through “filament splitting”, a unique branching mechanism not reported before in algae and initiated by formation of oblique cross walls, (2) aplanospore formation, and (3) reproduction by multiflagellate zoospores with 4–24 flagella arranged in groups of four. Phylogenetic analyses identified the alga as Barranca multiflagellata gen. et sp. nov. (Barrancaceae fam. nov., Chaetophorales, Chlorophyceae). Moreover, the Chaetophoraceae Greville, 1824 was emended and a new family, Uronemataceae (fam. nov.) erected.

CONCLUSIONS:
The discovery of Barrancaceae fam. nov. highlights the importance of investigating nonconventional habitats to explore microalgal diversity. The reproductive versatility demonstrated by Barranca suggests adaptation to a semiterrestrial habitat with large fluctuations in water availability.","0002-9122

To better understand the ecology of these species, in this study we described and compared the breeding strategies (i.e., nest dimensions, nest height from the ground, egg laying rhythm, clutch size, length of the developmental periods, breeding phenology, and diversity of nesting substrate) of five passerine birds that inhabit sub-Antarctic ecosystems. During three breeding seasons (2014–2017), we monitored 103 nests of the five most abundant open-cup forest-dwelling passerines (Phrygilus patagonicus, Anairetes parulus, Turdus falcklandii, Elaenia albiceps, and Zonotrichia capensis) on Navarino Island (55°S), Cape Horn Biosphere Reserve, southern Chile. Additionally, we compared the breeding strategies of T. falcklandii to another population breeding at lower latitude (39°S). Most of the species started laying eggs the last week of September; only E. albiceps started 2 months later. During the breeding season of 2016–2017 both E. albiceps and Z. capensis started laying eggs earlier than the previous year. Anairetes parulus and Z. capensis were the most specialized in terms of nesting substrate. Turdus falcklandii had larger clutch sizes and nested closer to the ground on Navarino Island compared to the northern population, which might put this and other ground nesting species of this island at a higher risk of predation by the recently introduced American mink (Neovison vison). Our five study species breed exclusively in open-cups (not in cavities) in sub-Antarctic forests, and some of them built their nests closer to the ground compared to populations breeding at lower latitudes. This may be associated with the lack of terrestrial predators on Navarino Island. Our study opens further questions about the mechanisms driving differences in breeding strategies among populations.

We conducted a six-week study of movement patterns of C. zebrata on the island of Ugi to determine home-range sizes and overlap among conspecifics. Twenty-five lizards were fitted with radio transmitters and were followed for periods of 5–38 days.

Radio-tagged individuals were located more often in the canopy than on the trunk of the tree, where humans typically search for the lizards. The home range is smaller than expected for a similar-sized herbivorous lizard occupying a terrestrial habitat, but the small home range is consistent with results from other arboreal animals.

",,"Wiley
",,,,"Aim
The extent and diversity of invertebrate aerial dispersal both on remote islands and in polar regions has long been of interest to biogeographers. We therefore monitored the airborne dispersal of insects and other micro- and macroinvertebrates to and on Macquarie Island in order to assess (1) the magnitude and composition of local aerial dispersal activity by the island's invertebrate fauna, and (2) the potential for exotic arrival and establishment.

Location
Macquarie Island.

Methods
Two robust wind-traps were run year-round on Macquarie Island from 1991 to 1994 to collect airborne insects and other micro- and macroinvertebrates.

Results
More than 3000 invertebrates were caught in these traps over the sampling period in the most comprehensive aerial survey of subantarctic invertebrates to date. Representatives of seven orders of Insecta were captured: Psocoptera, Thysanoptera, Hemiptera, Coleoptera, Diptera, Lepidoptera and Hymenoptera. Other taxa captured included other arthropods (Arachnida and Collembola) but also terrestrial Gastropoda. Evidence of possible long-distance dispersal (LDD) was limited to two exotic catches (one species of Collembolon, and one species of Thysanoptera). The abundance and composition of indigenous invertebrates caught in the traps indicates that the frequency of short-distance dispersal (SDD) movements on the island far exceeds that which had previously been realized.

Main conclusions
More than half the total catch (53%) was of flightless (i.e. passively dispersed) invertebrates, with 84% of them flightless in one of the two traps. The extent of passive dispersal movements is consistent, with most invertebrates being widely distributed at a whole-island scale. Aerial dispersal may act as a conduit for non-indigenous arrivals but this occurs infrequently. Other explanations for exotic species in traps are equally likely. The implications of these findings are discussed in relation to terrestrial invertebrate biogeography.","0305-0270

",,,,,,"Succession from anthropogenic grassland to secondary woody plant communities in New Zealand’s eastern South Island dryland zone has potential to alter animal communities. We compared indigenous and exotic birds, terrestrial invertebrates and ground-dwelling lizards in 100-ha blocks representing vegetation at three woodiness levels (grassland, mixed grassland–shrubland, and shrubland) at three sites in Central Otago. We predicted that shrublands would support invertebrate taxa and indigenous bird species complementary (additional) to those in grasslands, thus increasing the diversity of taxa present in the landscape, and that shrublands would have higher indigenous dominance of bird composition than grassland. We also expected that vegetation woodiness would affect the taxonomic composition of assemblages of indigenous and exotic birds and of ground-dwelling invertebrates. We predicted shrubland would have little net effect on indigenous dryland ground-dwelling lizards, which we expected to be regulated by other microhabitat characteristics. To test our predictions we used rarefaction-based analyses of faunal complementarity, and canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) and generalised mixed models of animal response variables in relation to vegetation and environmental predictors. Our results showed that shrubland blocks supported ground-dwelling invertebrate orders and indigenous forest bird species complementary to those present in grasslands. Block-level woodiness was a primary predictor of indigenous, but not exotic, bird assemblages. At smaller scales of transects within blocks, the indigenous dominance of bird species assemblages in shrubland blocks was not significantly higher than elsewhere, but was related to plant-community-specific variations in more numerous and diverse exotic birds. Terrestrial beetle-family assemblages within plots varied significantly with local woodiness, but invertebrate-order assemblages did not. Shrubland development had little effect on common ground-dwelling lizards, which showed strong microhabitat preferences and favoured habitats dominated by indigenous plant species. We conclude that sizeable (i.e. >1 km2) areas of shrubland vegetation enhanced the diversity of indigenous birds and of ground invertebrate orders present at a landscape scale. Both grassland and shrubland habitat patches in drylands supported indigenous ground-dwelling lizards, but lizards may be vulnerable to habitat modifications that reduce indigenous plant dominance.","0110-6465

As part of a larger study of the ecology of Dominica's forests, the distribution, density and biomass of three widespread lizard species (Anolis oculatus, Ameiva fuscata and Mabuya mabouya) were estimated in all major vegetation types. No consistent differences between seasons occurred for any of the three species, and at no site was a definite breeding season detected. Densities, estimated mainly by plot counts, were highest in coastal woodlands where mean densities reached 2148 Anolis per hectare, 379 Ameiva per hectare, and 751 Mabuya per hectare. Densities in rain forest sites were often very low. Combined biomass for the three species also reached a maximum in coastal woodlands of 44.7 kg/ha. This value is amongst the highest recorded for terrestrial reptile assemblages, and suggests that Dominica's coastal woodlands are unusually favourable habitats for reptiles.

Previous studies of Caribbean lizards have suggested that either competition or predation from birds may influence lizard densities. The present study, however, found no such relationships, and it was concluded that lizard density was independent of bird density.","0952-8369

",,,,"Malpelo Island is located 380km off the mainland continental coast of Colombia, in the Pacific Ocean. Several geological, ecological, and zoological studies, both marine and terrestrial, have been conducted in this island. Despite some marginal comments on some publications, no single specific survey has been devoted to botany so far. In order to make a floristic inventory of the terrestrial flora of this island, three field trips were made in 2010 to collect vascular plants, mosses, and lichens, as well as data on their distribution within the island. We collected and identified 25 species of lichens, two species of vascular plants and one moss. Lichens were the most diverse group found, including records of four new genera (Endocarpon, Fuscidea, Lecanographa and Verrucaria) and 13 new species for Colombia. The high lichen richness on Malpelo might be explained by their efficient form of asexual reproduction (soredia and isidia), that may have facilitated their transport to the island by migrating birds or wind. Once on the island, it is possible that lichens persist by being chemically protected against herbivores. The great number of new generic and species records for Colombia is explained by the low number of studies in saxicolous lichens conducted so far in the country, particularly on coastal areas and remote islands. Only two species of vascular plants were collected, a grass, Paspalum sp., and a fern, Pityrogramma calomelanos, and both of them correspond to new determinations for Malpelo. A moss species previously reported but with no positive identification was collected and identified as Octoblepharum albidum. Other species previously reported, for example, some species of shrubs, were not observed. The low number of vascular plants is probably due to a combination of soil conditions and herbivory by land crabs. This study is the first complete inventory of the flora of Malpelo and is a starting and reference point for future comparisons among islands in the Eastern Tropical Pacific.

",,,,"The land crab, Discoplax celeste (Gecarcinidae) is endemic to Christmas Island in the Indian Ocean. Due to a freshwater-dependant life history, in which the megalopae migrate from the ocean up freshwater streams to their adult terrestrial/freshwater habitat, D. celeste inhabits only a few isolated locations on the island. This restricted distribution is one of a number of factors which has previously highlighted the vulnerability of this species to outside threats. A number of anthropogenic factors including the introduction of multiple invasive species and habitat destruction have led to drastic ecosystem change on Christmas Island. The aim of this study was to investigate whether the restricted geographical distributions of D. celeste populations contribute to significant genetic structuring across Christmas Island, with an objective to inform future conservation strategies for this species on Christmas Island. Fragments of the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase I gene and the control region were sequenced from 95 individuals collected from all five locations on Christmas Island known to be inhabited by D. celeste. Analyses using analysis of molecular variance revealed no evidence of population sub-structuring, indicating that despite any geographical isolation, there is a single population of D. celeste on Christmas Island. This lack of population differentiation is probably explained by the oceanic dispersal of larvae, rather than terrestrial migration of D. celeste. Therefore, based on these results, for conservation purposes, D. celeste on Christmas Island can be considered a single management unit.","0025-3154

By 1952 several species were locally extinct. Between 1996 and 2011 rodents and cats were eradicated, and 5 mammal and 2 bird species were translocated to the islands. Monitoring of the broader terrestrial ecosystem over time has been limited. We used 20 dry-season Landsat images from 1988 to 2013 and estimation of green fraction cover in nadir photographs taken at 27 sites within the Montebello islands and six sites on Thevenard Island to assess change in vegetation density over time. Analysis of data averaged across the 26-year period suggests that 719 ha out of 2169 ha have increased in vegetation cover by up to 32%, 955 ha have remained stable and 0.6 ha have declined in vegetation cover. Over 492 ha (22%) had no vegetation cover at any time during the period analysed. Chronological clustering analysis identified two breakpoints in the average vegetation cover data occurring in 1997 and 2003, near the beginning and end of the rodent eradication activities. On many islands vegetation cover was declining prior to 1996 but increased after rodents were eradicated from the islands. Data for North West and Trimouille islands were analysed independently because of the potential confounding effect of native fauna being introduced to these islands. Mala (Lagorchestes hirsutus) and Shark Bay mice (Pseudomys fieldi) both appear to suppress native plant recruitment but not to the same degree as introduced rodents. Future research should assess whether the increase in vegetation cover on the Montebello islands is due to an increase in native or introduced plants.

",,"Oxford University Press
",,,,"Abstract The historical biogeography of many lineages—of both terrestrial and marine ocean habitats—remains poorly investigated even though remote ocean habitat covers approximately 66% of the Earth’s surface. One such lineage with poorly understood biogeographic affinities across vast ocean habitat is the genus Coprosma (Rubiaceae) with numerous species, and a widespread and disjunct distribution among the far-flung insular localities of multiple Pacific Islands. Here, the first taxonomically robust phylogeny for Coprosma s.s. was dated using molecular clock techniques and indicated Coprosma s.s. diverged from its sister genus Nertera likely during or shortly after the Oligocene Marine Transgression of New Zealand. Diversification of the five major clades identified occurred in New Zealand during the Miocene, which was then followed by multiple independent dispersals from New Zealand to various localities in many directions. The pattern of Coprosma ’s distribution in the Pacific appears stochastic both temporally and spatially, but evolution of an orange to red fruit colour prior to nearly all inferred dispersals hints at endozoochory by birds. The number of inferred long-distance dispersals of Coprosma s.s. (&amp;gt;30), and number of repeated dispersals to the same insular locality from unrelated Coprosma s.s. sublineages (&amp;gt;8) is perhaps the most currently known for a remote Pacific-centred genus investigated to date. A New Zealand origin for a Pacific-wide dispersal of taxa is not novel, but the manner in which the temporal and spatial distribution for Coprosma s.s. was achieved contributes to a novel understanding of the historical biogeography of widespread Pacific genera that have origins in the Southern Hemisphere.

",,,,"Abstract Aim Quantifying species abundances is costly, especially when many species are involved. To overcome this problem, several studies have predicted local abundances (at the sample unit level) from species occurrence distribution models ( SODM s), with differences in predictive performance among studies. Surprisingly, the ability of SODM to predict regional abundances of an entire area of interest has never been tested, despite the fact that it is an essential parameter for species conservation and management. We tested whether local and regional abundances of 21 terrestrial bird species could be predicted from SODM s in an exhaustively surveyed island, and examined the variation explained by species‐specific traits. Location La P alma I sland, C anary I slands. Methods We firstly assessed two types of algorithms representing the two main families of SODM s. We built models using presence/absence (boosted classification trees) and presence/background ( M ax E nt) data as a function of relevant environmental predictors and tested their ability to predict the observed local abundances. The predicted probabilities of occurrence ( P i ) were translated into animal numbers ( n′ ) using the revisited equation n i ′ = − ln(1−P i ) , and we obtained regional abundances (for the whole island). Results Predictive ability of presence/absence models was superior than that of MaxEnt. At the regional level, the observed average densities of all species were highly predictable from occurrence probabilities ( R 2 = 93.5%), without overall overestimation or underestimation. Interspecific variation in the accuracy of predicted regional density was largely explained ( R 2 = 73%), with habitat breath and variation in local abundance being the traits of greatest importance. Main conclusions Despite uncertainties associated with local predictions and the idiosyncrasies of each species, our procedures enabled us to predict regional abundances in an unbiased way. Our approach provides a cost‐effective tool when a large number of species are involved. Furthermore, the influence of species‐specific traits on the prediction accuracy provides insights into sampling designs for focal species.

","Lamelas-López, Lucas; Salgado, Iván",,Camera trap; Occupancy; Survey Methodology,,,2020.0,,,181,188,,,,,,55,2,"Oryx
",,"Cambridge University Press
",,,,"Abstract The introduction of mammal predators has been a major cause of species extinctions on oceanic islands. Eradication is only possible or cost-effective at early stages of invasion, before introduced species become abundant and widespread. Although prevention, early detection and rapid response are the best management strategies, most oceanic islands lack systems for detecting, responding to and monitoring introduced species. Wildlife managers require reliable information on introduced species to guide, assess and adjust management actions. Thus, a large-scale and long-term monitoring programme is needed to evaluate the management of introduced species and the protection of native wildlife. Here, we evaluate camera trapping as a survey technique for detecting and monitoring introduced small and medium-sized terrestrial mammals on an oceanic island, Terceira (Azores). Producing an inventory of introduced mammals on this island required a sampling effort of 465 camera-trap days and cost EUR 2,133. We estimated abundance and population trends by using photographic capture rates as a population index. We also used presence/absence data from camera-trap surveys to calculate detection probability, estimated occupancy rate and the sampling effort needed to determine species absence. Although camera trapping requires large initial funding, this is offset by the relatively low effort for fieldwork. Our findings demonstrate that camera trapping is an efficient survey technique for detecting and monitoring introduced species on oceanic islands. We conclude by proposing guidelines for designing monitoring programmes for introduced species.

",,,,"Abstract Terrestrial hermit crabs in the family Coenobitidae (genera Coenobita and Birgus ) are distributed in tropical and subtropical regions. They occupy various habitats ranging from shore to inland forests, and the two shore‐dwelling species, Coenobita rugosus and C. violascens , possess different distributional characteristics on Ishigakijima Island, Ryukyu Archipelago, Japan. Coenobita rugosus is distributed throughout the coast of the island and is abundant in beach areas, whereas C. violascens has mainly been found in river mouth areas. However, very little is known about the habitats used by the early life stages of coenobitid crabs because identifying the species of recently landed early juveniles is difficult. We tested whether the species compositions of early juveniles of coenobitids differed between beach and river mouth sites on Ishigakijima Island. We collected and identified the early stage coenobitids using PCR – RFLP techniques. A total of 576 early juveniles of five Coenobita species were collected, of which 0.7% were C. brevimanus, 7.3% were C. cavipes, 0.2% were C. purpureus, 70.1% were C. rugosus, and 21.7% were C. violascens . The early juveniles of Birgus latro were not found. The early juveniles of C. rugosus occurred at both beach and river mouth sites, and they were abundant at beach sites. The early juveniles of C. violascens were only found at river mouth sites. These findings indicate that C. rugosus and C. violascens complete their life cycles on land near the localities where they land. The early juveniles of the inland‐dwelling species, C. cavipes , were also mainly collected from river mouth sites, which suggested that juveniles of C. cavipes selected landing sites near river mouth areas and then migrated into the inland forests, passing through riverside areas. Our results highlighted the importance of river mouth areas for recruitment to adult habitats by some coenobitid species.

They are terrestrial but spend their marine life as planktonic larvae. Some coenobitid crabs are widely distributed in the Indo-West Pacific region, and some species occupy narrower ranges. To improve our knowledge of coenobitid crab speciation and geographical distribution patterns, we examined the phylogenetic relationship between Coenobita purpureus, which has a narrow distribution in the Northwestern Pacific, and its more widely distributed coenobitids including B. latro, Coenobita brevimanus, Coenobita cavipes, Coenobita perlatus, Coenobita rugosus and Coenobita violascens based on the mtDNA cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) and 16S rDNA genes. We also assessed the phylogeography of Co. purpureus populations based on the COI gene. Our phylogenetic and phylogeographical analyses revealed that (i) Co. purpureus clustered with Co. rugosus and (ii) the Co. purpureus population in the Ogasawara Islands was genetically distinct from those in other regions, which showed genetic panmixia. It has been hypothesized that Co. purpureus evolved in the isolated landmasses of the Ryukyu region during the Pliocene, and that its population expanded and colonized the Ogasawara Islands in the late Pleistocene. Further phylogeographical studies on Coenobita species with relatively narrow distributions coupled with characterization of their phylogenetic relationships with widely distributed congeners will advance our knowledge of the speciation and geographical distribution history of coenobitid crabs.","0173-9565

",,,,"Treeshrews (order Scandentia) comprise 2 families of squirrel-sized terrestrial, arboreal, and scansorial mammals distributed throughout much of tropical South and Southeast Asia. The last comprehensive taxonomic revision of treeshrews was published in 1913, and a well-supported phylogeny clarifying relationships among all currently recognized extant species within the order has only recently been published. Within the family Tupaiidae, 2 widely distributed species, the northern treeshrew, Tupaia belangeri (Wagner, 1841), and the common treeshrew, T. glis (Diard, 1820), represent a particularly vexing taxonomic complex. These 2 species are currently distinguished primarily based on their respective distributions north and south of the Isthmus of Kra on the Malay Peninsula and on their different mammae counts. This problematic species complex includes 54 published synonyms, many of which represent putative island endemics. The widespread T. glis and T. belangeri collectively comprise a monophyletic assemblage representing the sister lineage to a clade composed of the golden-bellied treeshrew, T. chrysogaster Miller, 1903 (Mentawai Islands), and the long-footed treeshrew, T. longipes (Thomas, 1893) (Borneo). As part of a morphological investigation of the T. glis-T. belangeri complex, we studied the proportions of hand bones, which have previously been shown to be useful in discriminating species of soricids (true shrews). We measured 38 variables from digital X-ray images of 148 museum study skins representing several subspecies of T. glis, T. belangeri, T. chrysogaster, and T. longipes and analyzed these data using principal components and cluster analyses. Manus proportions among these 4 species readily distinguish them, particularly in the cases of T. chrysogaster and T. longipes. We then tested the distinctiveness of several of the populations comprising T. glis and T. longipes. T. longipes longipes and T. l. salatana Lyon, 1913, are distinguishable from each other, and populations of T. “glis” from Bangka Island and Sumatra are distinct from those on the Malay Peninsula, supporting the recognition of T. salatana, T. discolor Lyon, 1906, and T. ferruginea Raffles, 1821 as distinct species in Indonesia. These relatively small, potentially vulnerable treeshrew populations occur in the Sundaland biodiversity hotspot and will require additional study to determine their appropriate conservation status.

",,,,"Abstract There is considerable scientific interest as to how terrestrial biodiversity in Antarctica might respond, or be expected to respond, to climate change. The two species of vascular plant confined to the Antarctic Peninsula have shown clear gains in density and range extension. However, little information exists for the dominant components of the flora, lichens and bryophytes. One approach has been to look at change in biodiversity using altitude as a proxy for temperature change and previous results for Livingston Island suggested that temperature was the controlling factor. We have extended this study at the same site by using chlorophyll fluorometers to monitor activity and microclimate of the lichen, Usnea aurantiaco-atra , and the moss, Hymenoloma crispulum . We confirmed the same lapse rate in temperature but show that changes in water relations with altitude is probably the main driver. There were differences in water source with U. aurantiaco-atra benefitting from water droplet harvesting and the species performed substantially better at the summit. In contrast, activity duration, chlorophyll fluorescence and photosynthetic modelling all show desiccation to have a large negative impact on the species at the lowest site. We conclude that water relations are the main drivers of biodiversity change along the altitudinal gradient with nutrients, not measured here, as another possible contributor.

The terrestrial mammals include 9 species of Insectivora, 6 (+ one tentative) of Chiroptera, one Primate, 12 Carnivora, 1 Perrissodactyla, 3 Artiodactyla, 19 Rodentia and 1 Lagomorpha. Native species include Boreal, Transition Zone and Austral elements, the result of Nova Scotia’s mid-latitude position on the continental coast.The 32 recorded marine species include 6 Carnivora (5 seals, walrus) and 26 Cetacea: Delphinidae (10 species), Phocoenidae (1), Monodontidae (1), Kogiidae (2), Physeteridae (1), Ziphiidae (4), Eschrichtiidae (1, extirpated), Balaenopteridae (5) and Balaenidae (1).Since 1971 four small mammal species (Sorex gaspensis, S. dispar, Glaucomys volans and Microtus chrotorrhinus) have been added to the provincial fauna, as a result of the first systematic and intensive sampling ever done in Nova Scotia. All are disjunct and three of them are restricted to forested talus habitats in the Cobequid Mts. or the Cape Breton Highlands. With the two disjunct species already known (Sorex arcticus maritimensis and Peromyscus leucopus caudatus), there are 6 disjunct mammals in the province, comprising 14.3 % of native non-volant terrestrial mammals, 33 % of insectivores and 18.8 % of native rodents. Two of them (Sorex gaspensis and Microtus chrotorrhinus) occur only on Cape Breton Island. No other area of similar size north of Mexico has a comparable proportion of disjunct mammals.Cape Breton Island historically has had a depauperate mammal fauna, lacking 8 species that were present on the adjacent mainland. The building of the connecting Canso Causeway in 1953-55 had a major zoogeographic impact, as it caused the western third of the strait to freeze over in winter and allowed the invasion and establishment of four large mammal species (Canis latrans, Procyon lotor, Mephitis mephitis and Lynx rufus).Le document présente l’information la plus récente sur la taxonomie, la répartition, l’habitat et la situation de 91 espèces de mammifères marins et terrestres qui vivent actuellement ou ont déjà vécu en Nouvelle-Écosse. Quatre d’entre elles ont disparu et une est éteinte. Sur les 86 autres espèces, 51 sont terrestres (46 espèces indigènes et 5 espèces introduites). Les mammifères terrestres comprennent 9 Insectivora, 6 (+ une espèce provisoire) Chiroptera, un Primate, 12 Carnivora, un Perrissodactyla, 3 Artiodactyla, 19 Rodentia et un Lagomorpha. La Nouvelle-Écosse étant située à une latitude moyenne sur la côte continentale, les espèces indigènes qui y vivent sont des éléments de la zone boréale, de la zone de transition et de la zone australe.Parmi les 32 espèces marines signalées, on compte 6 Carnivora important a (5 phoques et le morse) et 26 Cetacea: Delphinidae (10 espèces), Phocoenidae (1), Monodontidae (1), Kogiidae (2), Physeteridae (1), Ziphiidae (4), Eschrichtiidae (1, disparue), Balaenopteridae (5) et Balaenidae (1).Depuis 1971, à la suite du premier échantillonnage systématique et intensif mené en Nouvelle-Écosse, quatre espèces de petits mammifères (Sorex gaspensis, S. dispar, Glaucomys volans et Microtus chrotorrhinus) se sont ajoutées aux espèces fauniques de la province. Ce sont toutes des espèces disjointes, et trois d’entre elles sont confinées aux talus d’éboulis boisés des monts Cobequid ou des hautes-terres du Cap-Breton. Si on inclut les deux espèces disjointes déjà connues (Sorex arcticus maritimensis et Peromyscus leucopus caudatus), il existe 6 espèces disjointes de mammifères dans la province, qui représentent 14,3 % des mammifères terrestres indigènes qui ne volent pas, 33 % des Insectivores et 18,8 % des Rongeurs indigènes. Deux d’entre elles (Sorex gaspensis et Microtus chrotorrhinus) ne sont présentes que dans l’île du Cap-Breton. Au nord du Mexique, aucune autre région de taille semblable n’a une telle proportion d’espèces disjointes de mammifères.Dans le passé, l’île du Cap-Breton renfermait relativement peu de mammifères : on y trouvait 8 espèces de moins que dans la partie continentale de la Nouvelle-Écosse. La construction de la levée de Canso en 1953-1955 a eu un impact important zoogéographique du fait que, depuis, le tiers ouest du détroit gèle durant l’hiver, ce qui a permis à quatre espèces de gros mammifères (Canis latrans, Procyon lotor, Mephitis mephitis et Lynx rufus) de gagner l’île et de s’y établir.

",,,,"Through 17 years and from a sample of 7,790 faecal pellets and 26,346 prey items, we studied the diet of the Balearic lizard Podarcis lilfordi in Aire Island (Menorca, Balearic Islands, Spain). We analysed the diet in terms of prey frequencies, as well as by their volume and biomass contributions. The diet of the Balearic lizard was extremely variable through the years, months and areas under study. The dominance of small clumped prey, particularly ants, was confirmed. However, the main contribution by volume corresponded to beetles, with a relevant role for Diplopoda and terrestrial Isopoda during some months and at particular areas of the island. Several prey items were probably captured at the base of shrubs, under stones or inside rock crevices. Therefore, our estimations of electivity would only be reliable for epigeal and flying prey. The capacity of the Balearic lizard to include marine subsidies in its diet, such as coastal crustaceans, is noteworthy. Also, its consumption of carrion from carcasses of gulls and rabbits and leftovers from human visitors is remarkable. Juvenile conspecifics can also be a sporadic food resource, especially during the second half of summer, whereas the consumption of vegetal matter is constant for each whole year. The shifts of vegetal exploitation among areas of the island and months take place according to availability of different plant species at each area or during a given period. Thus, lizards are able to conduct a thorough monitoring of plant phenology, exploiting a large variety of plant species. Omnivory does not imply the indiscriminate inclusion of any edible food in its diet. Rather, the inclusion of several food items means the adoption of a wide range of foraging behaviours adapted to the exploitation of each food resource.

",,,,"ABSTRACT Two terrestrial Crustacea, Puhuruhuru patersoni (Amphipoda: Talitridae) and Styloniscus otakensis (Isopoda: Styloniscidae), were discovered on sub-Antarctic Macquarie Island in 1991 and 1992, respectively. Each species was identified as having been described, and previously only known, from South Island, New Zealand and from some of New Zealand's southern offshore islands. The distributions of the two species on Macquarie Island have been mapped in detail on four occasions over the last fifteen years, each mapping extending previously existing distributions or showing changes from the earlier records. Details of all four years' mapping are figured. It is concluded that these species were most likely introduced between 1810 and 1919 and that populations of the amphipod have not expanded to any extent in the twelve years between 1992 and 2004 but that the isopod has slightly increased its range. Both species are macrodetritivores, a trophic group not well represented on the island, so there is the possibility of an irreversible change to the Macquarie Island ecosystem if they become more widespread with warming climates. However no such change has yet been observed. The advantages and feasibility of removing these two exotic species from the island is discussed, as are the possible routes by which the species were introduced to the island.

",,,,"Abstract Terrestrial and freshwater molluscs are amongst the most threatened of all taxa, yet data exist on the distribution and status of only a small proportion of the species. Here we present the results of the first systematic survey of a terrestrial mollusc on the island of Príncipe in the Gulf of Guinea. Archachatina bicarinata has never been previously surveyed, despite being categorized as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List and suffering from unregulated harvesting for food. We found that A. bicarinata is restricted to primary rainforest and its abundance and probability of occurrence increased as surveyed sites became less accessible. Additional anecdotal evidence from the observations of previous scientific expeditions, local guides and snail harvesters suggested that the species has suffered a dramatic decline in population size and distribution in recent years. We therefore recommend that immediate action be taken to prevent its imminent extinction on Príncipe. The collection of A. bicarinata from protected areas should be banned, as should commercial harvesting and sales. Subsistence collecting should be limited to larger individuals. Our data have been used to inform the management plans for the protected areas on Príncipe and São Tomé, and this should help to ensure the future of A. bicarinata on both islands.

Two widely distributed European species, as well as three outgroups belonging to different isopod genera, were also included in the analyses. The samples used represent almost all Ligidium species known to occur in Greece, as well as several populations of unknown specific status plus some new records. Phylogenetic analyses of the combined data set were performed using Bayesian inference and maximum parsimony. The two main sister clades with good support indicate the sympatric differentiation of two lineages in southern continental Greece (Peloponnisos), where Ligidium populations exhibit a mosaic distribution of sibling species. The insular populations of the Aegean Islands show increased genetic divergence and form separate clades. The presence of a third lineage of Asiatic origin is strongly suggested by both the molecular phylogeny and morphology. The only presumably valid diagnostic morphological character exhibits only partial correspondence to well supported clades of the molecular phylogeny. Genetic differentiation between populations is very high, a fact that can be attributed to the strict ecological specialization of these animals that leads to increased levels of isolation even between populations that are in close proximity. As a consequence, Greek Ligidium populations, especially those present on islands, are unique genetic pools and extremely vulnerable to extinction.","0300-3256

",,,,"Walker Glacier near the northern coast of Ellesmere Island in the Canadian High Arctic (terrestrial margin of the ‘Last Ice Area’) is undergoing rapid ice attrition in response to climate change. We applied culture and molecular methods to investigate fungal diversity at the terminus of this glacier. Analysis of the mycoflora composition showed that the Walker Glacier isolates separated into two clusters: the surface of the glacier ice and the glacier foreland. The recently exposed sediments of the foreland had a lower fungal diversity and different species from those on the ice, with the exception of five species that occurred in both habitats. This loss of glacial ice in the Arctic is therefore resulting in the loss of habitats for cold-dwelling fungal species. Fungal diversity is a potentially rich biological resource of glacial ecosystems, with unique taxa. The rapid loss of these glacial habitats underscores the urgency for genomic surveys of fungal diversity in the High Arctic, and the need for further isolation of strains as well as cryopreservation of environmental micro-biome samples for future research and conservation.

We report a distal humerus of a frog from the Oligocene (approx. 29 Ma) of Puerto Rico that represents the earliest known fossil frog from any Caribbean island. Based on its prominent rounded distal humeral head, distally projecting entepicondyle, and reduced ectepicondyle, we refer it to the genus Eleutherodactylus. This fossil provides additional support for an early arrival of some groups of terrestrial vertebrates to the Greater Antilles and corroborates previous estimates based on molecular phylogenies suggesting that this diverse Caribbean lineage was present in the islands by the mid-Cenozoic.

Regarding carbon sequestration, I believe we are in agreement, Gray's comments being based on a misunderstanding of my original essay.

",,,,"This study was conducted to determine whether there were significant differences in the species richness and community composition of fish assemblages in coastal nearshore habitats with differing compositions of supralittoral vegetation.

2.
We sampled fish assemblages and conducted supralittoral vegetation surveys at 27 beaches on the west coast of Vancouver Island, British Columbia. Thirteen of the beaches had supralittoral vegetation characteristic of old-growth coastal forests and 14 had been previously subjected to logging or other disturbances.

3.
Physical features (e.g. substrate, salinity, etc.) were recorded at each beach to determine whether there were significant associations between supralittoral vegetation and beach characteristics as well as between beach characteristics and fish assemblages.

4.
Across all 27 beaches, 1832 individuals of 31 species of nearshore fish were collected, primarily juvenile cottids and salmonids. Mean species richness did not differ between beaches with old-growth versus secondary-growth supralittoral vegetation; however, a higher cumulative number of species was found at beaches with old-growth supralittoral vegetation.

5.
Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA) showed that beach characteristics and supralittoral vegetation were not significantly associated. Separate CCA for fish associations with beach characteristics and fish associations with supralittoral vegetation explained ∼55% of the variance in fish assemblage composition, suggesting that fish assemblage composition is significantly affected by substrate, submerged vegetation, and physico-chemical conditions as well as by the community composition of vegetation in adjacent supralittoral habitats.

6.
Specifically, we found associations between supralittoral vegetation and penpoint gunnels (Apodichthys flavidus Girard), tidepool sculpins (Oligocottus maculosus Girard), Pacific staghorn sculpins (Leptocottus armatus Girard), arrow gobies (Clevelandia ios Jordan and Gilbert), shiner perch (Cymatogaster aggregata Gibbons) and kelp perch (Brachyistius frenatus Gill). Juvenile chum (Oncorhynchus keta Walbaum) and coho (Oncorhynchus kisutch Walbaum) salmon were strongly associated with supralittoral vegetation characteristic of mature coastal forests such as mosses and western red cedar (Thuja plicata) suggesting that some nearshore fish species may be affected by processes originating in terrestrial ecosystems.

",,,,"The terrestrial mammalian fauna of the North Japanese island, Hokkaido, is more similar to that of Southern Siberia than to the main island of Japan, Honshu. Three species of the genus Myodes (Muridae, Rodentia) are found on Hokkaido, but not on Honshu. While Myodes rufocanus and M. rutilus are widely distributed across Hokkaido as well as the Eurasian continent, M. rex, which is endemic to Hokkaido and its adjacent islands, shows a discontinuous distribution pattern. We analyzed the phylogeographic history of M. rex using the mitochondrial DNA control region in order to interpret their discontinuous distribution pattern. Phylogenetic relationships among 54 distinct haplotypes showed that M. rex can be divided into four clades that occur on the northern, central, and southern regions of the Hokkaido mainland and on Rishiri Island, respectively. The phylogroups in the northern and central regions were largely separated in space, although several areas of sympatry were found. The phylogroup in the southern region, which was clearly separated from other phylogroups, showed markedly low genetic variability. All analyzed individuals from the population on Rishiri belonged to a separate lineage. Across a range of divergence rate estimates, we dated the basal divergence of all phylogroups to the mid to late Pleistocene, with subsequent signals of population expansion within lineages. We conclude that current phylogeographic structure in M. rex likely reflects Pleistocene survival in several separate refugia in situ. Past glacial ages have thus played an important role in shaping the current distribution patterns of mammalian species on Hokkaido.

Focusing on a biodiversity hotspot, the Mediterranean Basin, we aimed to identify those areas where evolutionary history is highly threatened and range-restricted in the region. Using null models, we first compared the spatial distributions of three indices: two measured threatened evolutionary history—Expected PDloss and Heightened Evolutionary distinctiveness and Global Endangerment—and one measured endemic evolutionary history—Biogeographically Evolutionary Distinctiveness. We focused on three vertebrate groups with high proportions of endemic, threatened species: amphibians, squamates and terrestrial mammals. Second, we estimated the spatial overlap of hotspots of threatened and endemic evolutionary history within the network of protected areas under several conservation scenarios. Areas that concentrate evolutionary history of conservation interest greatly differed among taxa and indices, although a large proportion of hotspots were identified in the Maghreb, in the East of the Mediterranean Basin as well as in islands. We found that, in a minimum conservation scenario, there was a significant proportion of hotspots for amphibians and squamates that were protected but not for terrestrial mammals. However, in a strong conservation scenario, only few hotspots overlapped with protected areas and they were significantly less protected than in a model where hotspots were chosen randomly. Some sites concentrate highly threatened and range-restricted evolutionary history of the Mediterranean basin and their conservation could be much improved. These sites are relevant for conservation studies aimed at designing new conservation actions to preserve evolutionary history and the option values it represents.

Results from a Westland petrel (Procellaria westlandica) colony on the South Island of New Zealand did not support the hypothesis. Instead, δ15N was universally marine (13–22‰).

The leiodid beetle occurs both in burrows and on the forest floor; beetles from both habitats had a marine δ13C. Ayersacarus woodi is found only in burrows.

",,,,"Aerially delivered toxic baits have proven effective for landscape-level control of numerous invasive vertebrate populations with major benefits for conservation and ecosystem function, but this technique has not been broadly adapted for control of invasive reptiles. Nonnative brown treesnakes (Boiga irregularis) on the Pacific island of Guam have caused severe ecological and economic damage and pose an invasion risk on other islands, making them a high-profile candidate for application of aerial baiting methods. Although terrestrial applications of traps, toxicants, and hand-removal are standard brown treesnake management practices, these methods are not cost-effective for control in the island's large tracts of remote, rugged forest. In 2016, the first major in situ evaluation of a helicopter-borne automated aerial bait delivery system applied snake-targeted toxic baits at an effective rate of approximately 120 baits/ha over a 110-ha forested test plot on Guam. We evaluated the extent and duration of the suppressive effect of this toxic bait application on brown treesnakes by measuring nontoxic bait take rates as a proxy index of relative snake abundance before and after toxic bait application in a treatment plot and surrounding reference area. We placed 4,420 nontoxic baits in random transects at georeferenced locations, from 1 month before until nearly 12 months after toxic bait application, allowing temporal analysis of the suppressive effect and spatial analysis of treatment plot reinvasion. Over the first 30 days after toxic bait application, average nontoxic bait take rate in the treatment plot was 41.2% lower than the pre-application rate, and there was no immediate decrease in bait take in the reference area. Reduced snake activity was still evident nearly 12 months after bait application. Roads forming a portion of the treatment boundary appeared to slow snake movement between treated area and surrounding untreated area. Trail cameras monitoring a subset of bait tubes showed that 97.5% of baits removed were taken by snakes rather than nontarget species. We indexed rodent abundance in the treatment plot and reference area, and found no indication of a rodent population increase following toxic bait application. Our results show that automated aerial bait applications can suppress brown treesnake abundance over a large area and that reinvasion from surrounding untreated habitat occurs over several months. We anticipate that repeated bait applications could achieve and maintain greatly reduced brown treesnake abundance on a landscape scale, potentially improving biosecurity and enabling experimental reintroduction of native birds extirpated by brown treesnake predation.

",,,,"Abstract High‐latitude terrestrial ecosystems face the triple threats of climate warming, increased exposure to UV arising from polar ozone depletion, and deforestation. Lichen communities of southernmost Chile are recognized for their high diversity, which includes nitrogen‐fixing cyanolichens. Such lichens are common on forest trees, contribute nitrogen to forests, and are sensitive to exposure following deforestation (widespread in this region). In a pilot study of exposure effects on tree lichens, using nondestructive imaging methods, we compared lichen communities on trunks of isolated vs. forest tree trunks of southern Chilean beech ( Nothofagus dombeyi , Nothofagaceae). We chose trees of similar diameter and trunk lean angle in conserved forest and nearby logged meadow on Navarino Island, XII Region Magallanes and Chilean Antarctica, Chile, within the annual southern ozone hole. Ninety‐five percent of cyanolichen records, including Nephroma antarcticum , and 66% of records for other foliose lichens were from the forest, whereas pendulous usneoid lichens dominated N. dombeyi bark at the meadow site. Limitation of cyanolichen growth on isolated trees could affect ecosystem function in this poorly studied habitat. Possible factors contributing to strong community differences were increased light intensity, UV radiation, and wind stress, plus limited ability of lichens to colonize isolated trees in the logged meadow. UV radiation was likely an important stressor for some lichen species but not others. We recommend more extensive monitoring to pinpoint causes of differing lichen communities, and we encourage better protection of bark‐dwelling lichens in southern hemisphere regions facing multiple threats.

",,,,"The hypothesis of Crassulacean acid metabolism (CAM) is that it is a physiological adaptation to arid or otherwise dry habitats. Stomata are closed during the day and open at night when the evaporative demand is low. Thus exogenous CO2 is fixed at night with relatively little water loss. CAM is typically found in succulents occurring in desert and dry Mediterranean regions, but not in the cold deserts of Asia. Recently, it has become known that many arid tropical succulent plants are CAM as well, particularly those growing epiphytically. The vegetation of St. John, U.S. Virgin Islands, ranges from desertlike cacti at the windward, dry eastern side of the island to near tropical rainforest at the higher elevations. Native CAM plants are found in families Agavaceae, Bromeliaceae, Cactaceae, Clusiaceae, Orchidaceae, Piperaceae and Vitaceae. Exotic CAM species are in the families Aizoaceae, Crassulaceae, and Liliaceae. The distribution of these plants is entirely consistent with the hypothesis of CAM being an adaptation to arid habitats. All species in the Agavaceae and Cactaceae are CAM. All of the Bromeliaceae with the exception of the terrestrial Pitcairnia and the epiphytic Catopsis are CAM. The epiphytic and dry habitat orchids occurring in the genera Epidendrum, Oncidium, Vanilla, and Tetramicra are CAM. Of three species of Cissus, only the species occurring in the most arid zones, C. trifoliata, is CAM. Clusia rosea is enigmatic in that it is epiphytic when young and a rooted tree when mature. It is the only known genus of true dicotyledonous trees to have CAM. Two of the most serious exotic weeds naturalized in arid scrub areas are CAM, Sansevieria trifasciata and Bryophyllum pinnatum.

Mammals such as squirrels can be valuable biological sentinels for environmental pollution and the intention of this pilot project was to test a new, rapid technique that allows direct detection of mercury (Hg) in hair samples. Our aim was to establish, for the first time, if red squirrels in Europe show any indication of mercury pollution; and to compare levels from red squirrels in two rural UK (Arran and Brownsea Island) and one Polish city population (Warsaw). The latter is exposed to higher levels of Hg from coal-fired power plants. Total mercury levels ranged from 11.1 to 801.95 μg/kg. Contrary to our expectations, females from the Island of Arran had significantly higher Hg values than either males or females from the two other sites. Although the Isle of Arran was the only site where the difference between females and males was significant, our findings for both Poland and the UK suggest that mercury does not only accumulate in marine food chains and the arctic ecosystem, but is present in urban ecosystems and terrestrial woodlands. Data on trends to determine if Hg values are accumulating in arboreal mammals are completely lacking, and point to a need for a monitoring strategy of mercury levels and associated, potential health impacts in endangered species.","0394-1914

Thanks to recent field surveys and plant inventories conducted between 2004 and 2017 by the Conservatoire Botanique National de Mascarin (CBNM), a total of 250 taxa (120 native, 107 alien and 23 cryptogenic) belonging to 66 families and 178 genera, was recorded. This represents an increase of 42-313% for the four surveyed islands. While Bassas da India does not show any terrestrial flora, the flora of Europa includes 94 taxa (47 native, 39 alien and 8 cryptogenic), that of Juan de Nova 147 taxa (62 native, 69 alien and 16 cryptogenic), that of the Iles Glorieuses 137 taxa (67 native, 61 alien and 9 cryptogenic) and that of Tromelin only 21 taxa (7 native and 14 alien). The native plant species density is lower for Europa (1.56/km²) and Tromelin (7/km²) and highest for Juan de Nova and the Iles Glorieuses (12.4/km² and 15.3/km² respectively). The native vascular floras of Europa, Juan de Nova and the Iles Glorieuses are mainly characterized by pantropical (24-30%) and Indo-Pacific taxa (13-22%). In Juan de Nova and Europa, the Malagasy elements sensu stricto are strongly represented (13-15%), while taxa in the Iles Glorieuses are confined to the southwest of the Indian Ocean (30%). Europa, Juan de Nova and Tromelin seem to host local endemics species while one taxon found both on Juan de Nova and Grande Glorieuse is endemic to these two islands. The alien flora of Europa, Juan de Nova and the Iles Glorieuses comprise between 64% and 97% naturalized taxa while that of Tromelin hosts 50% of non-naturalized alien taxa.

",,"Wiley
",,,,"Aim
Genetic differentiation of terrestrial organisms among islands is assumed to be affected by the geological history of the islands, such as the time elapsed since the formation of islands or straits. Cicadas are generally poor dispersers, but some cicada groups have colonised continental and oceanic islands and evolved into endemic species. Here, we focused on a cicada group in the northwestern Pacific region to reveal the association between intra- and interspecific genetic differentiation and the geological history of islands for cicadas on continental islands. We also clarified whether colonisation of oceanic islands was achieved by long-distance dispersal or artificial introduction.

Location
Japanese Archipelago, Ogasawara Islands, Ryukyu Archipelago.

Taxon
Cicadas of the genus Meimuna (Hemiptera: Cicadidae).

Methods
We performed phylogenetic analysis, divergence time estimation, and ancestral area reconstruction using two mitochondrial and four nuclear gene sequences and population genetics analyses, including Bayesian skyline plotting using a mitochondrial gene sequence.

Results
Meimuna opalifera in the Japanese Archipelago, which was connected to the continent during the glacial periods, diverged from the continental populations 0.4 million years ago (Ma). In the Ryukyu Archipelago, which became disconnected from the continent earlier, two endemic species Meimuna kuroiwae and M. oshimensis diverged 2.4 Ma; these species showed differences in intraspecific genetic differentiation and range expansion. Furthermore, Meimuna iwasakii colonised the South Ryukyus from Taiwan Island later than 1.4 Ma, whereas M. boninensis, which is endemic to the oceanic Ogasawara Islands, diverged from M. kuroiwae in the Middle Ryukyus 1.04 Ma.

Main conclusions
Genetic divergence among Meimuna species was larger on the continental islands that disconnected earlier, as was expected from the geological history of the islands. However, the pattern of intraspecific genetic differentiation differed between species within the same island region, possibly due to their ecological characteristics. In addition, colonisation of oceanic islands was achieved by long-distance (possibly wind-borne) dispersal from the continental islands. Thus, the formation of island cicada fauna was affected by islands’ geological history and species’ ecological characteristics, as well as accidental long-distance dispersal events.","0305-0270

",,,,"We describe a new species of Cettia from the Crown Prince Range, Bougainville Island, North Solomons Province, Papua New Guinea. By combining morphometric and molecular phylogenetic techniques, we attempt to broaden our understanding of evolutionary processes within the genus Cettia in the southwest Pacific. The new species proves to be distinct with respect to several morphological characteristics that are most probably related to a more terrestrial lifestyle than that of its congeners. Molecular data agree with morphological data in establishing that these birds are at least as distinct from the other island forms of Cettia as those forms are from each other, far exceeding intraspecific variation. These data and the restricted distribution of the population on Bougainville strongly support recognition of a new species. The application of molecular phylogenetic techniques also supports the idea that the new species and other island forms of Cettia confined to mountains on southwest Pacific islands are derived from a single common ancestor rather than being independently derived from one or more mainland forms. In addition, the relatively recent discovery of two new species of Cettia suggests that additional forms await discovery in other poorly known areas of the southwest Pacific. Our results point to the need for further molecular studies and for additional field research into the distribution and ecology of forest songbirds on islands.

Both dietary (targeted) and inedible (incidental) items were eaten by tuatara. Dietary items recorded were exclusively invertebrate in origin. Estimates of environmental availability of invertebrates and indicated that the prey consumed were strongly selected by size and by taxa. Beetles, insect larvae, arachnids and weta comprised the greatest proportion of total diet, appeared in the greatest number of stomachs and were taken in excess of their abundance. Most prey were >10 mm in length, despite an abundance of smaller prey in the environment. The risk of predation by tuatara was greatest for terrestrial invertebrates and least for arboreal species. The composition of diets by habitat was largely similar between mid‐successional kanuka (Kunzea ericoides) and late successional mixed broadleaf forest. The size distribution of prey eaten by tuatara in kanuka habitat during autumn, and the low number of tuatara yielding dietary samples, are discussed in terms of food competition with kiore. Overall, the foraging behaviour of tuatara was not obviously different on rodent‐free compared to kiore‐inhabited islands, either indicating that food competition is insufficient to influence diet, or that tuatara are unable to change their feeding behaviour under a higher degree of competitive pressure for prey items.

",,,,"Islands are hotspots of biodiversity and extinction. It is critical to study their unique island life before it is lost forever. The Desventuradas Islands, comprised of San Félix and San Ambrosio islands, are a volcanic archipelago 850 km off the coast of Chile. They are key to understanding the diversification processes which shaped the flora and fauna of other Chilean oceanic islands such as the Juan Fernández Archipelago. But, the biogeographic affinities between these archipelagos are still poorly known. Over the last century, the plant and animal communities present in the Desventuradas have radically changed due to invasive mammal introductions. Here, focusing on terrestrial invertebrates, we: (1) confirm the presence of described endemic species, (2) detect new species records and (3) assess the biogeographic affinities between the Juan Fernández and Desventuradas archipelagos. In September 2018, San Ambrosio was surveyed using different methods (hand collecting, beating sheet, entomological net, pitfall traps and light traps) at night and during the day. A total of 35 morphospecies were collected. Four endemic species were found, in addition to several previously described higher taxonomic groups with undescribed species. Collecting methods were not successful in detecting another nine previously described endemic species. There was a total of 28 new records, including a new land snail, a new Isopoda and representatives of five spider families. Twelve of all the recorded genera from Desventuradas Islands have known relatives in the Juan Fernández Archipelago. Five of them were not previously known for San Ambrosio, reinforcing the biogeographic affinities between both archipelagos. This research highlights the urgency of surveying islands subject to a multitude of threats, including climate change and invasive species, to generate baseline data and place the island’s fauna in a broader biogeographical context.","0022-2933

Our work on Tylos highlights the importance of combining taxonomic and molecular analyses to support taxonomic decisions and uncover cryptic diversity. Due to the multiple threats to Caribbean coastal habitats, taxonomic and molecular genetic research are urgently needed to understand biodiversity patterns of oniscideans in the Caribbean, which will inform strategies for their protection. Such studies will also contribute to our knowledge of their evolution, ecology, and potential uses, as well as the factors that have shaped the remarkable Caribbean biodiversity.

",,,,"Human-induced impacts such as climate change and habitat alterations, coupled with limits on funding, have forced conservation actions into a mode of triage. Although no current method has been agreed upon as the best approach to select species for conservation, many studies have demonstrated the utility of incorporating phylogenetic diversity into these decisions. In many cases, degree of phylogenetic relatedness is thought to provide a measure of functional diversity, and greater phylogenetic distinctiveness is likely linked to ecosystem stability. Despite recent debate over the validity of this notion, phylogenetic information remains an important factor to consider in evaluating species and regions for conservation attention. Emberizoidea is a large radiation of 830 species, representing roughly 17% of all songbirds and 8% of all birds. Species in this clade are found throughout the Americas and occur in all terrestrial biomes in the region. The large distribution of this clade, coupled with its morphological and ecological diversity, makes it an important radiation to study from an evolutionary and conservation perspective. This study provides conservation priorities for all species in Emberizoidea using evolutionary distinctiveness (ED) and Evolutionarily Distinct and Globally Endangered (EDGE) values from a pseudoposterior distribution of time-calibrated supertrees. We found that threat level is not correlated with degree of ED, indicating that the most threatened species do not represent a disproportionate amount of ED. In addition, threatened species are slightly clustered across the phylogeny, indicating similar threats may be affecting groups of closely related species such as island radiations or geographically restricted radiations in highly disturbed regions.","1367-9430

",,,,"Aim
The Aleutian Islands, one of the southern margins of Beringia, were covered with ice caps during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). Although insular refugia for animal species have been hypothesized in this region, phylogeographical studies have never explored the biogeographical history of plant species. We aim to assess the population history of the flora of the Aleutian Islands and its biogeographical relevance to East Asia.

Location
The Aleutian Islands, Kamchatka, the Japanese Archipelago.

Methods
We sequenced seven nuclear loci from the alpine shrub Therorhodion camtschaticum (Pall.) Small (Ericaceae) and elucidated the geographical distribution of genetic variation. The divergence history among populations from the Aleutian Islands, Kamchatka and northern Japan was inferred by analyses based on coalescent simulations.

Results
Populations were genetically distinct between northern Japan and Beringia. In spite of the genetic differentiation, the divergence between Beringia and northern Japan occurred during or after the last glacial period [maximum-likelihood estimates (MLEs) = 10.6–15.5 ka with 95% highest posterior densities (HPDs): 1.7–43.5 ka]. The latter region has a larger population size than the former region. In contrast, widespread genetic similarity was revealed among the geographically separated populations in the Aleutian Islands and southern Kamchatka. Among these populations, a model assuming population decline fits better than a model that assumes either constant population size or population growth.

Main conclusions
Our study suggests that insular refugia were unlikely for T. camtschaticum in the Aleutian Islands. Instead, T. camtschaticum may have had a wider range during LGM, encompassing both the Aleutian Islands and southern Kamchatka, or have colonized the Aleutian Islands from a LGM refugium that was the source of colonization into southern Kamchatka as well or encompassed the latter region. Our study provides novel insight into the biogeographical history of terrestrial biota in the Aleutian Islands.","0305-0270

To assess the circulation of hantavirus at the national level, we carried out a survey of small terrestrial mammals from representative regions of the island and identified environmental factors associated with hantavirus infection. As we were ultimately interested in the potential for human exposure, we focused our research in the peridomestic area. Sampling was achieved in twenty districts of Madagascar, with a rural and urban zone in each district. Animals were trapped from a range of habitats and examined for hantavirus RNA by nested RT-PCR. We also investigated the relationship between hantavirus infection probability in rats and possible risk factors by using Generalized Linear Mixed Models. Overall, 1242 specimens from seven species were collected (Rattus rattus, Rattus norvegicus, Mus musculus, Suncus murinus, Setifer setosus, Tenrec ecaudatus, Hemicentetes semispinosus). Overall, 12.4% (111/897) of Rattus rattus and 1.6% (2/125) of Mus musculus were tested positive for THAIV. Rats captured within houses were less likely to be infected than rats captured in other habitats, whilst rats from sites characterized by high precipitation and relatively low seasonality were more likely to be infected than those from other areas. Older animals were more likely to be infected, with infection probability showing a strong increase with weight. We report widespread distribution of THAIV in the peridomestic rats of Madagascar, with highest prevalence for those living in humid areas. Although the potential risk of infection to human may also be widespread, our results provide a first indication of specific zone with high transmission. Gathered data will be helpful to implement policies for control and prevention of human risk infection.

",,,,"Eukaryotic algae in the top few centimeters of fellfield soils of ice-free Maritime Antarctica have many important effects on their habitat, such as being significant drivers of organic matter input into the soils and reducing the impact of wind erosion by soil aggregate formation. To better understand the diversity and distribution of Antarctic terrestrial algae, we performed a pilot study on the surface soils of Meseta, an ice-free plateau mountain crest of Fildes Peninsula, King George Island, being hardly influenced by the marine realm and anthropogenic disturbances. It is openly exposed to microbial colonization from outside Antarctica and connected to the much harsher and dryer ice-free zones of the continental Antarctic. A temperate reference site under mild land use, SchF, was included to further test for the Meseta algae distribution in a contrasting environment. We employed a paired-end metabarcoding analysis based on amplicons of the highly variable nuclear-encoded ITS2 rDNA region, complemented by a clone library approach. It targeted the four algal classes, Chlorophyceae, Trebouxiophyceae, Ulvophyceae, and Xanthophyceae, representing key groups of cold-adapted soil algae. A surprisingly high diversity of 830 algal OTUs was revealed, assigned to 58 genera in the four targeted algal classes. Members of the green algal class Trebouxiophyceae predominated in the soil algae communities. The major part of the algal biodiversity, 86.1% of all algal OTUs, could not be identified at the species level due to insufficient representation in reference sequence databases. The classes Ulvophyceae and Xanthophyceae exhibited the most unknown species diversity. About 9% of the Meseta algae species diversity was shared with that of the temperate reference site in Germany. In the small portion of algal OTUs for which their distribution could be assessed, the entire ITS2 sequence identity with references shows that the soil algae likely have a wide distribution beyond the Polar regions. They probably originated from soil algae propagule banks in far southern regions, transported by aeolian transport over long distances. The dynamics and severity of environmental conditions at the soil surface, determined by high wind currents, and the soil algae's high adaptability to harsh environmental conditions may account for the high similarity of soil algal communities between the northern and southern parts of the Meseta.

",,,,"Abstract The Open Bay Islands are a Māori-owned Wildlife Refuge located in South Westland (South Island) and support two of the rarest lizard species in New Zealand: the Open Bay Island skink and the Open Bay Island gecko. Both species have been assigned a threat status of Nationally Critical – the highest priority for conservation action. The terrestrial and diurnal habits of the skink make it particularly vulnerable to predation by wēkā, a flightless rail native to New Zealand but introduced to the Open Bay Islands c. 100 years ago. Here, we present results from a 5-day survey of the two main islands (14.7-ha Taumaka and 2.2-ha Popotai) and consider options for reducing the negative impacts of wēkā on skinks and other terrestrial fauna (wēkā removal, exclosure fencing and refuge supplementation; all subject to iwi approval). In total, 19 skinks were caught over 125 trap-days. The majority (16 individuals) were caught on Popotai Island, from which skinks had not been previously recorded. We conclude that removing wēkā from both islands is the only option guaranteed to increase skink abundance, with collateral benefits to other terrestrial fauna on the Open Bay Islands.

",,,,"Habitat conversion to agricultural land is one of the main threats to terrestrial biodiversity and can affect ecosystem processes and cause changes in ecosystem services (ESs) and disservices (EDs). Yet, studies often rely only on the abundance and diversity of the service providers; the effects on ecological processes of habitat conversion are rarely directly monitored. In this study, we used the sentinel approach to evaluate how habitat conversion from native forest to agricultural land affected ESs and EDs on an oceanic island. We quantified herbivory on lettuce plants, invertebrate and vertebrate predation rates on artificial caterpillars, pollination on strawberry plants, seed predation on wheat and mustard seeds, and leaf decomposition rates in native forests, maize fields and pastures on Terceira Island, Azores (Portugal). Herbivory, invertebrate predation rates, and pollination service were not significantly different between habitats. Vertebrate predation rates in native forests (mean 6.1% d−1) were significantly higher than that in pastures (0.3% d−1), or high-elevation maize fields (0.5% d−1), and marginally higher than in low-elevation maize fields (2.2% d−1). Overall seed predation after 48 h was significantly higher on wheat (mean 16.8%) than mustard seeds (5.6%). High-elevation maize fields also had higher seed predation (27.8%) than low-elevation ones (0.6%) or pastures (3.6%), but did not differ from the native forest (12.9%). Decomposition after 90 days was highest in pastures (78.4% and 45.9%, for tea and rooibos, respectively); although no significant differences between habitats were detected, except for low-elevation maize fields (64.4% and 33.6%). Conversion from native forest to cultivated land did not cause a clear decrease in the intensity of the studied ESs/EDs except for vertebrate predation. Using direct monitoring tools to simultaneously and consistently quantify multiple ecological processes is not only possible but needed, as ecological processes can respond differently to landscape changes.

",,,,"Abstract
Questions
Abandonment of anthropogenic ecosystems threatens biodiversity in rural areas globally. Successional responses in anthropogenic ecosystems have been shown to differ from those in natural ecosystems because of the legacy of continuous management activities. However, few studies have focused on successional changes in anthropogenic freshwater ecosystems following abandonment. Focusing on two drivers (water depletion and cessation of anthropogenic disturbance), we tested whether water depletion plays a larger role than years since abandonment in determining the both plant functional diversity and composition in farm ponds.

Location
Awaji Island, western Japan.

Methods
We investigated flora at 200 farm ponds, which had experienced long-term continuous anthropogenic disturbance. We interviewed 100 managers of the surveyed ponds and local farmers to identify the ponds’ management status. To capture community processes during succession, we focused on functional richness and functional trait composition. We assessed the relative contribution of the two successional drivers in determining functional richness by adopting a linear model. We classified the survey ponds into five groups based on the two successional drivers and performed PERMANOVA to test differences in functional composition among the groups.

Results
Water depletion played a larger role than elapsed time since cessation of anthropogenic disturbance in determining functional richness. Functional composition of water-depleted ponds significantly differed from that of managed ponds, regardless of years since abandonment.

Conclusions
Our results indicate that water depletion has a larger effect on successional changes in ponds than cessation of anthropogenic disturbance; that is, water depletion drives succession and overrides the legacy of continuous anthropogenic disturbance. The results suggest that, in freshwater ecosystems, the functional change in a community is greater in the transition from macrophytes to terrestrial plants than it is in the transition from stress-tolerant species to competitive species.","1402-2001

We collate information from a wide range of sources to provide a framework to inform the ongoing management of the terrestrial and aquatic fauna and flora species that have conservation significance on the island. These include endemic flora and fauna; species listed as threatened by state, national and international authorities; species that are rare or extinct in other parts of their original range; species of biogeographic significance; and migratory birds and marine fauna of national and international significance. In addition, Barrow Island has been of value in acting as a source area for translocations of vulnerable and endangered mammal species that have been eradicated in other parts of their range. The many species with conservation significance and their use in successful translocation programs demonstrates the island’s national and international importance for conservation.

",,,,"The Mauritius olive white-eye Zosterops chloronothos is the least known of the eight threatened terrestrial bird species remaining on the island of Mauritius. The olive white-eye has declined drastically in numbers and distribution since 1975. Surveys carried out between 1998 and 2001 estimated that 93–148 pairs remained within an area of less than 25 km2. Most areas that held olive white-eye territories in 1975 supported considerably fewer territories in 2001. This decline is thought to have primarily been the result of deforestation and degradation of native habitat and intense nest predation by introduced mammals. Declines have been more severe in areas dominated by native vegetation than they have been in areas that contained substantial amounts of exotic Cryptomeria and Pinus. The continued decline of the Mauritius olive white-eye is of critical concern and immediate species-specific conservation management is required for its survival.

",,,,"Rapid and accurate surveys of land are essential for protecting ecosystems. This study aimed to survey the spatial–temporal land degradation patterns and explore its driving mechanism based on a geographical detector in Hainan Island from 2000 to 2020. First, the areas of forest, cultivated land, and construction land were analysed, and their mutation year was determined through the Mann-Kendall abrupt test. Then, change vector analysis was used to create a double-evaluation system by combining the normalized difference vegetation index and net primary productivity. Finally, the geographical detector was used to identify the driving mechanism of different land-use types. The results show that 2013 was the mutation year of the three land-use types. From 2000 to 2013 (Stage 1), the land degradation areas of forest, cultivated land, construction land, grassland, and unutilised land reached 1977.13, 613.25, 165.81, 261.06, and 4.25 km2, respectively. From 2013 to 2020 (Stage 2), the degraded land area accounted for only 0.91 % of the island's total area. From the single factor perspective, the elevation (DEM), least distance to residential area (LDP), and variety of mean annual temperature (VTem) were found to be the dominant factors of land degradation of cultivated land and grassland, forest, construction land in Stage 1. On the other hand, in Stage 2, the main factor of land degradation was the variety of the density of GDP (VGDP) in cultivated land, grassland, and construction land, while it was the variety of mean annual precipitation (VPre) in the forest. Moreover, all pair-factors provided a higher determinant power for degraded land areas than a single factor. From the interaction effect perspective in Stage 1, VPOP ∩ LDR (i.e. the variety of the density of population density and least distance to roads or railways), LDP ∩ LDR, and VTem ∩ LDR were the most significant pair-factors of the interaction effect on land degradation of cultivated land, forest and grassland, and construction land. In Stage 2, the most significant pair-factors of the interaction effect in different land-use types were DEM ∩ VPOP and VPre ∩ POP in degraded cultivated land, VPre ∩ DEM and VPre ∩ LDR in degraded forest land, DEM ∩ VTem in degraded grassland, and VGDP ∩ LDR in degraded construction land. Given the time-lag effects of factors and the attribution analysis of land degradation, we suggest limiting the construction of roads and residential areas, increasing biodiversity, and sheltering forests to protect terrestrial ecosystems in the future.

Here, we examine how the seasonal activity patterns of ants-key drivers of terrestrial ecosystem functioning-vary with anthropogenic land-cover change on a subtropical island landscape, and whether differences in temperature or species composition can explain observed patterns. Using trap captures sampled biweekly over 2 years from a biodiversity monitoring network covering Okinawa Island, Japan, we processed 1.2 million individuals and reconstructed activity patterns within and across habitat types. Forest communities exhibited greater temporal variability of activity than those in more developed areas. Using time-series decomposition to deconstruct this pattern, we found that sites with greater human development exhibited ant communities with diminished seasonality, reduced synchrony and higher stochasticity compared with sites with greater forest cover. Our results cannot be explained by variation in regional or site temperature patterns, or by differences in species richness or composition among sites. Our study raises the possibility that disruptions to natural seasonal patterns of functionally key insect communities may comprise an important and underappreciated consequence of global environmental change that must be better understood across Earth's biomes.

The cyclonic influence appears to be a major cause of inter-cay variations in plant species distribution. This is shown by comparing the orientation and position of the cays in 1964 with their present morphology. Gannet Cay for example only has a very small percentage of the vegetated area common to both the 1964 and 1984 cay outlines. A total of 13 species of terrestrial vascular plants have been recorded from the cays. Four species were prevalent and persistent since 1967.

This study also revealed that the three islands had different nematode faunas, which were explained especially by soil pH, texture, and exchangeable basic cations.

",,,,"Located on the eastern margin of Eurasia, the Japanese Archipelago hosts a unique modern fauna of terrestrial vertebrates including landbirds which show a high proportion of endemic species/subspecies.Despite its potential importance in taxonomy and biogeography, the Pleistocene landbird fossil record has been scarce on Japanese islands, providing little information on the history of the unique fauna in the region.In this study, fossil remains of non-passeriform landbirds from the middle-late Pleistocene (Marine Isotope Stages [MIS] 9 and 5e) of Shiriya, northernmost Honshu Island, Japan, are revised with extensive osteological comparisons.As a result, the presence of at least six non-passeriform landbird species, represented by 71 specimens, was confirmed: Syrmaticus sp., Coturnicini gen.et sp.indet., Columbidae gen.et sp.indet., Apus sp., Haliaeetus sp., and Accipitridae gen.et sp.indet.The Shiriya paleoavifauna is the first substantial Pleistocene landbird fauna reported from the central Japanese islands so far, and suggests that the overall landbird fauna in northern Honshu in the last interglacial period (MIS 5e) was not drastically different from the present one, in contrast to the presence of several extinct land mammals and seabirds in the local fauna.The occurrence of Syrmaticus despite the supposedly colder climate in that time than today suggests that the distribution of modern S. soemmerringii might not be totally defined by climatic factors, but probably affected by a biogeographic barrier at the strait between Honshu and Hokkaido islands.

Two species, readily differentiated on the basis of size, are assigned to the new genus. P. jagmi sp. nov. is known only from the North Island, and the larger P. yaldwyni sp. nov. only from the South Island. Pachyplichas, which appears to be more closely related to Xenicus than to the diminutive Acanthisitta or the aberrant Traversia, exhibits several unique osteological features, including a highly modified pelvis and extraordinarily sturdy hind limbs. These features, allied with its relatively reduced wing skeleton, indicate that, like most other Acanthisittids, Pachyplichas was largely terrestrial in habit.

Here, we investigate the role of birds in the colonisation by Ochetophila trinervis (Rhamnaceae), a vascular plant from the southern Andes, of sub-Antarctic Marion Island. The location of O. trinervis on the island far from human activities, in combination with a reconstruction of island visitors' travel history, precludes an anthropogenic introduction. Notably, three bird species occurring in the southern Andes inland have been observed as vagrants on Marion Island, with the barn swallow Hirundo rustica as the most common one. This vagrant displays long-distance migratory behaviour, eats seeds when insects are in short supply, and has started breeding in South America since the 1980s. Since naturalised O. trinervis has never been found outside the southern Andes and its diaspores are incapable of surviving in seawater or dispersing by wind, a natural avian dispersal event from the Andes to Marion Island, a distance of >7500 km, remains the only probable explanation. Although one self-incompatible shrub seems doomed to remain solitary, its mere establishment on a Southern Ocean island demonstrates the potential of vagrancy as a driver of extreme long-distance dispersal of terrestrial biota.

",,,,"Abstract Based on a comprehensive literature survey, we determined the sources of the terrestrial vertebrate species on Christmas Island, asking where they originated relative to Wallace’s Line (the southern end of the divide lies 1100 km to the east, where the Lombok Strait adjoins the eastern Indian Ocean). The two bats, Pipistrellus murrayi and Pteropus natalis, are from the west. Concerning the endemic and ‘resident’ bird species, one is from the west (Collocalia natalis), four are from the east (Accipiter fasciatus, Egretta novaehollandiae, Falco cenchroides and Ninox natalis) and the other 15 are ambiguous or indeterminate. Most of the land-locked species are also from the east: rodents Rattus macleari and Rattus nativitatis, and squamates Cryptoblepharus egeriae, Emoia nativitatis and Lepidodactylus listeria. Additionally, two have westerly origins (Crocidura trichura and Cyrtodactylus sadleiri), one is ambiguous (Emoia atrocostata) and another is unknown (Ramphotyphlops exocoeti). West-directed surface currents that flow across the eastern Indian Ocean towards Christmas Island would have facilitated most of the land-animal colonizations. We therefore suggest that Wallace’s Line be redrawn such that the landmass is placed on the Australasian side of this fundamental biogeographical boundary.

",,,,"Nothing is known about the community-scale plant ecology of early Cretaceous volcanic environments in the southern high latitudes. The paleoecology of the early Aptian (119–120 Ma) volcaniclastic Cerro Negro Formation of South Shetland Islands, Antarctica, has been investigated to improve understanding of these enigmatic ecosystems. This unit was deposited in an intra-arc setting at the edge of the paleo-polar circle (66°S). Taphonomic analysis of megaflora in seven volcanic facies indicates the existence of a spatially complex vegetation mosaic co-dominated by conifers, bennettites, and ferns. A lower stratigraphic unit was deposited by high-magnitude, low-frequency silicic eruptions, partially reworked by fluvial processes. Following ash falls, shrubby communities of ferns and bennettites dominated for short periods in low-altitude paleovalleys before being replaced by araucarian-podocarp-fern conifer forests. Forests of podocarp conifers and bennettites covered adjacent mid-altitude slopes of active volcanic cones. These were destroyed periodically by hot pyroclastic flows, and their charred remains washed down into paleovalley fluvial systems. Analysis of architectural and phenological data from both major forest communities indicates the predominance of evergreen trees with a canopy height of c. 20–30 m. Growth-ring analysis indicates that, despite occasional catastrophic eruptions, growing conditions were mostly favorable and uniform, although in riparian paleovalley niches flooding locally produced more stressful growing conditions. An upper stratigraphic unit was deposited by low-magnitude, high-frequency basaltic eruptions. Shrubby, fern and bennettite-dominated vegetation, together with local conifer stands, colonized this environment. Growth of more widespread arborescent vegetation in the upper unit was inhibited by high-frequency volcanic disturbances. Bennettites are much more abundant and diverse in the Cerro Negro Formation compared with coeval, non-volcanic sites in the southern high latitudes, indicating that this group may have favored volcanic environments.","0883-1351

",,,,"The gas-transporting properties of the haemolymph of Birgus latro L. were investigated in vitro. This terrestrial anomuran is restricted in distribution to the tropics, and on Christmas Island inhabits a highly stenothermal environment.

The effect of temperature on haemocyanin oxygen-affinity was pronounced (ΔH = –39 kJ mol−1) and was considered to represent the absence of any specific adaptation to environmental temperature. The Bohr effect was large for a terrestrial decapod (ϕ = –0·60), although reduced at low pH. Changes in [Ca] had a significant effect on oxygen affinity of dialysed haemolymph (ΔlogP50/ Δlog[Ca] = –0·39) whereas [Mg] had no effect. Increasing, [L-lactate] had a small effect on the oxygen affinity of dialysed haemolymph (ΔlogP50/ Δlog[lactate] =–0·013) but not whole haemolymph. Dialysis increased oxygen affinity, suggesting the presence of a dialysable component that suppresses affinity. The effect of L-lactate was inhibited in whole haemolymph.

The oxygen affinity of Birgus haemolymph was largely insensitive to effector substances, with the possible exception of Ca. In the case of lactate, at least, this was not due to a reduced sensitivity of the haemocyanin, a situation different from that in closely related species.

Carbon dioxide transport was also affected by temperature. Birgus haemolymph showed a high nonbicarbonate buffer capacity  which could be correlated with a high haemocyanin concentration. It is concluded that terrestrial anomuran decapods depend on mechanical adjustments of ventilation and perfusion, rather than employing direct modulation of haemocyanin function, to optimize oxygen delivery.","0022-0949

",,,,"The Hawaiian endemic fern Polypodium pellucidum, named for its characteristic translucent leaf veins, is a member of the monophyletic, primarily temperate species group known as the Polypodium vulgare complex. Since its original description in 1824, P. pellucidum has been recognized as morphologically diverse and several varieties have been named. The most commonly recognized are a rainforest epiphyte (var. pellucidum), a lava flow terrestrial (var. vulcanicum), and var. opacum, characterized by a lack of translucent veins. Electrophoretic analysis of isozymes was used to test available systematic hypotheses and gain new perspectives on the breeding system and distribution of genetic variation within this species. These analyses showed that 1) levels of genetic variability were very high for an island endemic species, 2) based on fixation indices (F), outcrossing between genetically differentiated gametophytes was rare, 3) values of Nm were consistent with interpopulational gene flow as a relatively rare event, 4) genetic identity (I) between populations within taxa averaged above 0.85 whereas that between two of the varieties averaged 0.785, and 5) although morphologically distinct, P. pellucidum var. opacum is isozymically identical to P. pellucidum var. vulcanicum. Assuming a single introduction with subsequent diversification, the high levels of genetic variation indicate that P. pellucidum has been a resident of the Hawaiian islands for a relatively long period of time, perhaps longer than the oldest of the current islands, and has migrated from island to island. Although reduced genetic identities between the two ecologically divergent varieties suggest that they may eventually become separate species, the genetic similarity of P. pellucidum var. opacum to P. pellucidum var. vulcanicum indicates that it should not be recognized as a separate variety.","0363-6445

Would these communities return to their former state in terms of density, species composition, and species diversity after nitrogen additions ended, and if so, how rapid was their recovery? Plant density by species and species diversity were determined over a 20 year period from permanent plots established on three different-aged dunes on a Virginia barrier island. Two dominant species responded differently to nitrogen additions. Ammophila breviligulata abundance was enhanced by the additions, and, in most cases, Spartina patens abundance was repressed. On the older Hog Island dunes, the addition of nitrogen over a 10 year period had a dramatic and rapid negative effect on diversity. However, recovery to diversity values observed in the control plots was rapid, beginning almost immediately after nitrogen additions were stopped. The dune vegetation on a Virginia barrier island appears to be quite resilient, as it rapidly recovered from diversity loss after 10 years of nitrogen additions.","0749-0208

On eastern Frøya and some small islands in the archipelago, area expansions at another four frog localities have been prevented by ecological barriers like unfavourable limnetic or terrestrial habitats or salty water. Two local common toad populations on eastern Frøya do not show any expansion either. However, an apparently isolated record of the species on western Frøya in 2011 can possibly be explained by the expansion westwards of a population in northern central Frøya, where toads were introduced around 1995.

PCBs were measured in marine sediments, shorthorn sculpin (Myoxocephalus scorpius), and black guillemots (Cepphus grylle) to assess ecosystem recovery over an eight-year period after cleanup of the source. Surface sediment measurements indicate decreases in both the extent and average concentrations of PCBs throughout Saglek Bay.

PCB levels have also decreased significantly in black guillemot nestlings collected from the former contaminated beach area, as well as Island (6−8 km from the source) and Reference (greater than 18 km from the source) locations. This study demonstrates the utility of using indicator species, especially the black guillemot, to monitor PCB uptake in benthic food webs.

",,,,"Pulau Babi Tengah is a small granitic island, ca. 106 ha, lying off the south-east coast of Peninsular Malaysia. Except for plantation of coconut trees in the early 1900s and deforestation by refugees during the Vietnamese civil war, 1975–1981, the island has not been affected by human development and very few species have been introduced. Recently, a tourist resort has opened in the south and has initiated activities for the conservation of biodiversity. As part of that commitment, an exhaustive inventory of all terrestrial vascular plants has been done. The flora contains 312 taxa with 252 genera and 101 families. Several rare species, known only from this group of islands in Peninsular Malaysia, are recorded, as well as four Peninsular Malaysian endemic species. The most striking characteristic of Pulau Babi Tengah is the rarity of the exotic element, which is restricted to the anthropic areas.

",,,,"Abstract Designating protected areas remains a core strategy in biodiversity conservation. Despite high endemism, montane forests across the island of Java are under-represented in Indonesia's protected area network. Here, we document the montane biodiversity of Gunung Slamet, an isolated volcano in Central Java, and provide evidence to support its increased protection. During September–December 2018, we surveyed multiple sites for birds, primates, terrestrial mammals, reptiles, amphibians and vegetation. Survey methods included transects, camera traps and targeted searches at six sites, at altitudes of 970–2,512 m. We used species distribution models for birds and mammals of conservation concern to identify priority areas for protection. We recorded 99 bird species (13 globally threatened), 15 mammals (five globally threatened) and 17 reptiles and amphibians (two endemic). Our species distribution models showed considerable cross-taxon congruence between important areas on Slamet's upper slopes, generally above 1,800 m. Particularly important were records of the endemic subspecies of the Endangered Javan laughingthrush Garrulax rufifrons slamatensis , not recorded in the wild since 1925, the Endangered Javan gibbon Hylobates moloch and Javan surili Presbytis comata , and the Vulnerable Javan lutung Trachypithecus auratus and Javan leopard Panthera pardus melas . Recent forest loss has been modest, at least 280 km 2 of continuous forest remain above 800 m, and our surveys show that forest habitats are in good condition. However, the mountain is widely used by trappers and hunters. Given its importance for biodiversity conservation, we discuss different options for improving the protection status of Gunung Slamet, including designation as a National Park or Essential Ecosystem.

This archipelago is geographically isolated and lacks terrestrial mammalian predators as well as woody plants, providing a contrasted habitat to the forests inhabited by the other two Aphrastura spp. Individuals of Diego Ramírez differ morphologically from Aphrastura spinicauda, the taxonomic group they were originally attributed to, by their larger beaks, longer tarsi, shorter tails, and larger body mass. These birds move at shorter distances from ground level, and instead of nesting in cavities in trees, they breed in cavities in the ground, reflecting different life-histories. Both taxa are genetically differentiated based on mitochondrial and autosomal markers, with no evidence of current gene flow. Although further research is required to define how far divergence has proceeded along the speciation continuum, we propose A. subantarctica as a new taxonomic unit, given its unique morphological, genetic, and behavioral attributes in a non-forested habitat. The discovery of this endemic passerine highlights the need to monitor and conserve this still-pristine archipelago devoid of exotic species, which is now protected by the recently created Diego Ramírez Islands-Drake Passage Marine Park.

",,,,"Abstract Monitoring rodent abundance is critical to understand direct and indirect trophic interactions in most northern terrestrial ecosystems. However, logistic constraints can prevent researchers from using capture–mark–recapture methods, a robust approach to estimate abundance. Our objective was to determine the correlation between abundance estimates of Arctic lemmings obtained from live‐trapping data with spatially explicit capture–recapture models ( SECR ; N/ha) and abundance indices obtained from snap‐trapping along trap lines (N/100 trap‐nights), winter nest sampling along transects with distance sampling models (N/ha), burrow counting within quadrats (N/100 m 2 ), and incidental observations (N/100 observer‐hr). We also evaluated the impact of reduced sampling effort on the bias and precision of each abundance estimate. Data from brown ( Lemmus trimucronatus ) and collared lemmings ( Dicrostonyx groenlandicus ) were collected each year from 2007 to 2016 on Bylot Island, Nunavut, Canada. Snap‐trapping ( r = 0.90) and incidental observations ( r = 0.92) yielded the highest correlations with live‐trapping densities for brown lemmings, the most abundant species. When combining abundance of both lemming species, snap‐trapping ( r = 0.77) and incidental observations ( r = 0.90) also yielded the highest correlations. Indices from winter nests and burrows were also correlated ( r &gt; 0.50) with live‐trapping densities, but to a lesser degree. We found that bias generally increased when effort was reduced for methods involving modeling of capture or detection probabilities (i.e., live‐trapping, winter nests), but remained low for the other methods. In contrast, precision of estimates remained high when using SECR models, but decreased substantially for the other methods during years of low lemming abundance. Non‐convergence of SECR and distance sampling models generally increased when reducing effort and was frequent in years of low lemming abundance. Interestingly, collecting &gt;200 h of incidental observations generated highly reliable estimates of lemming abundance compared to results from live‐trapping, indicating that such non‐invasive method can provide valuable data at low cost. We provide guidelines on other invasive or non‐invasive methods that can be used when small mammals cannot be live‐trapped and suggest the effort required to achieve a given precision.

However, there are few direct comparisons of the structure and functioning of scavenging communities in different ecosystems. Here, we monitored the consumption of 23 fish (seabream Sparus aurata) and 34 bird (yellow-legged gull Larus michahellis) carcasses on a small Mediterranean island (Isla Grosa, southeastern Spain) and surrounding waters in summer to compare the structure of the scavenger assemblages and their carrion consumption efficiencies in terrestrial and shallow water habitats. Scavenging was highly efficient both in marine and terrestrial environments, especially in the presence of a highly abundant vertebrate scavenger species, the yellow-legged gull. The vertebrate scavenger community was richer in the marine environment, whereas the invertebrate community was richer on land. The scavenger network was usually well-structured (i.e., nested), with the exception of the community associated with fish terrestrial carcasses, which were almost monopolized by yellow-legged gulls. In contrast, gulls left conspecific carcasses untouched, thus allowing longer persistence of gull carcasses on land and their exploitation by a diverse insect community. Our study shows important differences in the scavenging process associated with environment and carcass type. Promising avenues for further eco-evolutionary and applied research arise from the comparison of scavenging processes in terrestrial and marine ecosystems, from small islands to continents.

In this work, we studied the relationship between the leech Batracobdella algira and the European terrestrial salamanders of the genus Hydromantes, identifying environmental features related to the presence of the leeches and their possible effects on the hosts. We performed observation throughout Sardinia (Italy), covering the distribution area of all Hydromantes species endemic to this island. From September 2015 to May 2017, we conducted >150 surveys in 26 underground environments, collecting data on 2629 salamanders and 131 leeches. Water hardness was the only environmental feature correlated with the presence of B. algira, linking this leech to active karstic systems. Leeches were more frequently parasitizing salamanders with large body size. Body Condition Index was not significantly different between parasitized and non-parasitized salamanders. Our study shows the importance of abiotic environmental features for host-parasite interactions, and poses new questions on complex interspecific interactions between this ectoparasite and amphibians.

",,,,"1. The hydrologic connectivity between landscape elements and streams means that fragmentation of terrestrial habitats could affect the distribution of stream faunas at multiple spatial scales. We investigated how catchment- and site-scale influences, including proportion and position of forest cover within a catchment, and presence of riparian forest cover affected the distribution of a diadromous fish.

2. The occurrence of koaro (Galaxias brevipinnis) in 50-m stream reaches with either forested or non-forested riparian margins at 172 sites in 24 catchments on Banks Peninsula, South Island, New Zealand was analysed. Proportions of catchments forested and the dominant position (upland or lowland) of forest within catchments were determined using geographical information system spatial analysis tools.

3. Multivariate analysis of variance indicated forest position and proportion forested at the catchment accounted for the majority of the variation in the overall proportion of sites in a catchment with koaro.

4. Where forest was predominantly in the lower part of the catchments, the presence of riparian cover was important in explaining the proportion of sites with koaro. However, where forest was predominantly in the upper part of the catchment, the effect of riparian forest was not as strong. In the absence of riparian forest cover, no patterns of koaro distribution with respect to catchment forest cover or forest position were detected.

5. These results indicate that landscape elements, such as the proportion and position of catchment forest, operating at catchment-scales, influence the distribution of diadromous fish but their influence depends on the presence of riparian vegetation, a site-scale factor.","0046-5070

",,"Taylor & Francis
",,,,"On the Atlantic island of Madeira, mobile invertebrate predators such as perlid and perlodid stoneflies as well as a native fish fauna are absent, permitting tests of hypotheses concerning the influence of predators on the nocturnality of drift. Here, species and size composition of the drift, in addition to drift lengths, were studied in two man‐made waterways (levadas). It was found that the following insects dominated in the drift: Baetis rhodani (Ephemeroptera), Dixa tetrica (Diptera), Chironomidae (Diptera), and Simuliidae (Diptera). Wind increased the drift density, evidently by causing large amounts of terrestrial plant material to enter, especially in the more open streams. It seems likely that the drifting material caused the benthic animals to drift either through direct mechanical action or via indirect effects, such as visual disturbance.

Rainbow and brown trout were successfully introduced into the island of Madeira in 1961. In a levada with trout, B. rhodani drifted significantly more by night. In another levada devoid of fish there was no difference between daytime and nighttime drift density. The size composition in the drift of A rhodani was skewed so that larger nymphs dominated by night in the presence of fish. Where fish did not occur there was no difference in size distribution between night and day. This is in accordance with an expected “risk of prédation”; being greater on larger insects in the light because of size‐selective feeding by the fish. Dixa tetrica drifted significantly more by night in the fishless levada in which the population had a size composition that was biased towards larger larvae. In the other levada containing fish there were no diurnal patterns in drift numbers. This is in accordance with a previous report in which a dixid has been shown to occur in the drift to a higher extent at pupation.

A set of experiments demonstrated that the drift distance of & rhodani v/as less than 20 m in a channelized stream having a current velocity as high as 2.0 m s−1, and that nymphs of B. rhodani will drift upon a visual disturbance.","0165-0424

We collected new specimens from the Central Ryukyus and revealed that the border of distribution of the two species lies between the Central and Southern Ryukyus, i.e., the Kerama Gap. Moreover, the estimated divergence time (15.8 Mya) of the two species, based on the mitochondrial COI gene, was older than the recently estimated time (1.55 Mya) of formation of the Kerama Gap. These results highlight the risks of a priori assumption solely on the basis of geological data for applying it as a calibration point to some terrestrial animals in this region. Typopeltis stimpsonii was genetically divided into four lineages, two of which turned out to be endemic to the Okinawa Islands. All specimens from the main island of Japan and Shikoku were in one lineage, which was also found in the Amami Islands and Hachijojima Island. This suggests that these specimens may have been dispersed by human activity. Typopeltis crucifer included five genetic lineages. Species collected from Ishigakijima and Iriomotejima Islands were genetically diversified not between the borders of these islands but within Ishigakijima Island.

In addition, Guam now serves as a source population for the dispersal of snakes to other islands. Control of the brown treesnake is dependent upon the use of traps in a variety of settings, including port environments and in forested habitat. A variety of snake traps have been used on Guam; most consist of a modified crawfish or minnow trap, housing a live mouse that serves as a lure. We compared the efficacy of three trap styles: (1) a two-piece design with a separate internal mouse chamber; (2) a one-piece trap, with design improvements aimed at decreasing handling; and (3) the same one-piece trap, fitted with a PVC-coated wire-mesh entrance flap. Data collected included snake capture rates, snake size distribution, mouse survival, and trap maintenance time. Snake capture rates did not differ between the one-piece and the two-piece traps, although capture rates were significantly lower in the PVC-flap traps. The average snake size or distribution of snake sizes did not differ between the one-piece and two-piece traps. Handling times, both with and without a snake in the trap, were significantly lower for the one-piece trap. Mouse survival did not differ between the one-piece and two-piece trap styles.

One species (Alsophila commutata Mett.) was newly documented for the Philippines and three species [Pteris whitfordii Copel., Selliguea elmeri (Copel.) Ching, and Selliguea pyrolifolia (Goldm.) Hovenkamp] were newly documented for Mindanao Island. Of the 28 threatened species recorded, one is critically endangered, 13 are endangered, nine are vulnerable, and five are considered other threatened species.","0031-7683

",,,,"Abstract In 2017, three major hurricanes (Irma, Jose, and Maria) impacted the Northeastern Caribbean within a 2-week span. Hurricane waves can cause physical damage to coastal ecosystems, re-suspend and transport antecedent seafloor sediment, while the associated intense rainfall can yield large influxes of land-derived sediment to the coast (e.g. burial of ecosystems). To understand sedimentation provenance (terrestrial or marine) and changes induced by the hurricanes, we collected bathymetry surveys and sediment samples of Coral Bay, St. John, US Virgin Islands in August 2017, (pre-storms) and repeated it in November 2017 (post-storms). Comparison reveals morphologic seafloor changes and widespread aggradation with an average of ~25 cm of sediment deposited over a 1.28 km 2 benthic zone. Despite an annual amount of precipitation between surveys, sediment yield modeling suggests watersheds contributed &lt;0.2% of the total depositional volume. Considering locally established accumulation rates, this multi-hurricane event equates to ~1–3 centuries of deposition. Critical benthic communities (corals, seagrasses) can be partially or fully buried by deposits of this thickness and previous studies demonstrate that prolonged burial of similar organisms often leads to mortality. This study illuminates how storm events can result in major sediment deposition, which can significantly impact seafloor morphology and composition and benthic ecosystems.

",,,,"Avian malaria (Plasmodium spp.) has been implicated in the decline of avian populations in the Hawaiian Islands and it is generally agreed that geographically isolated and immunologically naïve bird populations are particularly vulnerable to the pathogenic effects of invasive malaria parasites. In order to assess the potential disease risk of malaria to the avifauna of Socorro Island, México, we surveyed for Plasmodium isolates from 1,300 resident field-caught mosquitoes. Most of them were identified as Aedes (Ochlerotatus) taeniorhynchus (Wiedemann, 1821), which were abundant in the salt marshes. We also collected Culex quinquefasciatus Say, 1823 close to human dwellings. Mitochondrial ND5 and COII gene sequences of Ae. taeniorhynchus were analyzed and compared to corresponding sequences of mosquitoes of the Galápagos Islands, Latin America, and the North American mainland. Aedes lineages from Socorro Island clustered most closely with a lineage from the continental U.S. Plasmodium spp. DNA was isolated from both species of mosquitoes. From 38 positive pools, we isolated 11 distinct mitochondrial Cytb lineages of Plasmodium spp. Seven of the Plasmodium lineages represent previously documented avian infective strains while four were new lineages. Our results confirm a potential risk for the spread of avian malaria and underscore the need to monitor both the mosquito and avian populations as a necessary conservation measure to protect endangered bird species on Socorro Island. Avian malaria is a vector-borne parasitic disease caused by various species of Plasmodium and is known to have adversely affected bird populations (Valkiūnas 2005). All currently known avian Plasmodium spp. rely on mosquitoes for the completion of their natural life cycles and transmission. It has been suggested that mosquitoes play a major role in limiting geographic ranges of bird populations and in the spread of avian malaria worldwide (Valkiūnas 2005). While most studies on the prevalence and diversity of avian malaria have focused on isolates from vertebrates, some more recent studies have examined strains and lineages in field-caught mosquitoes (Ejiri et al. 2008, Gager et al. 2008, Ishtiaq et al. 2008, Kim et al. 2009, Kimura et al. 2006, Njabo et al. 2009, Tompkins and Gleeson 2006). Emerging infectious agents that are novel to any geographical region continue to pose threats to naïve endemic fauna (Cunningham et al. 2003, Daszak et al. 2000, Tompkins and Poulin 2006) and thus are recognized as a cause of wildlife extinctions worldwide (Smith et al. 2006). Due to geographical isolation, island populations are often particularly vulnerable to introduced pathogens (e.g., Fromont et al. 2001). For example, the introduction of Culex quinquefasciatus to the Hawaiian Islands was followed by the introduction of one or more birds infected with Plasmodium relictum (Beadell et al. 2009). Because Cx. quinquefasciatus, a competent vector for Plasmodium spp., was able to proliferate through the Hawaiian archipelago, populations of naïve endemic avifauna are reported to have declined after exposure to avian malaria (Atkinson and Van Riper III 1991, Van Riper et al. 1986, Warner 1968). Since these devastating consequences in Hawaii, other island avian populations have been closely monitored, most notably on the Galápagos Islands (Levin et al. 2009, Padilla et al. 2004, Parker et al. 2006, Santiago-Alarcón et al. 2010). To date, three mosquito species have been reported from the Galápagos Islands range: the southern house mosquito Culex quinquefasciatus Say, 1823, the black salt marsh mosquito Aedes (Ochlerotatus) taeniorhynchus (Wiedemann, 1821), and Aedes (Stegomyia) aegypti (Linnaeus, 1762) (Peck et al. 1998). All three species of mosquitoes are known vectors of disease agents affecting wildlife and could potentially contribute to endemic wildlife declines on these islands (Bataille et al. 2009a, Bataille et al. 2009b, Levin et al. 2009, Parker et al. 2006, Peck et al. 1998, Smith et al. 2006, Snell et al. 2002, Whiteman et al. 2005, Wikelski et al. 2004). We collected mosquitoes on Socorro Island to assess the disease risk to its endemic wildlife. The island is located approximately 700 km west of the port city of Manzanillo, Colima, México. With three other volcanic islands, it is part of the Revillagigedo Archipelago Biosphere Reserve (SEDESOL 1994). Wildlife is depauperate on Socorro Island, with terrestrial birds predominating among a few reptiles and only introduced mammals (Brattstrom and Howell 1956). Although Ae. taeniorhynchus was reported earlier in coastal habitats (Vázquez 1960), there is no recent documentation on the distribution and diversity of the mosquito fauna on this island. Because of its location, Socorro Island shares several biogeographical attributes with the Galápagos Islands and has a high degree of biotic endemicity (Brattstrom 1990, Levin and Moran 1989). Socorro Island has the largest concentration of endangered birds in México (Alliance for Zero Extinction 2010, Ricketts et al. 2005), including two critically endangered species, the Socorro mockingbird (Mimus graysoni) and Townsend′s shearwater (Puffinus auricularis), the endangered Socorro Parakeet (Aratinga brevipes), the extinct in the wild Socorro dove (Zenaida graysoni), and one definitive extinction, the Socorro Elf Owl (Micrathene whitneyi graysoni;Brattstrom 1990, IUCN 2006). Habitat degradation and cat predation have been implicated in the declines of these species (Martínez-Gómez and Curry 1996, Martínez-Gómez et al. 2001, Martínez-Gómez and Jacobsen 2004). However, the presence of mosquito species that are known competent vectors for an array of pathogens presents an additional threat for the endemic birds and must be studied prior to reintroduction efforts for the Socorro dove (Martínez-Gómez et al. 2010). We hypothesized that due to high levels of human-aided transport through boats and airplanes and a comparable location in the Eastern Pacific Ocean, Socorro Island would similarly harbor mosquito species found in the Galápagos Islands. By employing a phylogenetic approach using mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) sequence analyses we explored the possible origins of the mosquitoes on the island and the diversity of their haemosporidian parasites. We examine for the first time avian parasite infectivity in mosquitoes found on this remote island and discuss its conservation implications. Mosquitoes were collected in July, 2009 from five sites on the island (Figure 1): Las Grutas (Site 1; N 18° 44’ 4. 8”, W 110° 56’ 48. 3”), Los Cedros (Site 2; N 18° 45’ 28. 9”, W 110° 56’ 44. 4”), Playa Blanca (Site 3; N 18° 48’ 51”, W 111° 02’ 422. 5”), Llano de Borregos (Site 4; N 18° 45’ 57. 5”, W 110° 56 ‘58. 5”), and the pier (Site 5; N 18° 44’ 41. 6”, W 110° 56’ 30. 7”) using eight Center for Disease Control (CDC) Miniature Light Traps baited with CO2 emitting packets (John W. Hock, Gainesville, FL). Traps were hung from trees approximately 1 m above ground and 6 m apart from one another and operated from dusk until dawn (approximately 12 h). Early in the mornings, collection bags were removed from the traps and the mosquitoes were immobilized by smoke fumigation and sorted by sex. Mosquitoes were then pooled into groups of 20 and held in vials containing silica beads as a desiccant to prevent DNA degradation until identification. Map of Socorro Island showing the geographical distribution of study sites where mosquito traps were set. Las Grutas (Site 1), Los Cedros (Site 2), Playa Blanca (Site 3), Llano de Borregos (Site 4), and the pier (Site 5). Circles indicate sites where no mosquitoes were trapped and triangles where successful trapping occurred (Base map courtesy of Manuel Escamilla – INECOL according to the photomap prepared by Mexico's National Institute of Statistics, Geography and Informatics – INEGI). Voucher female and all male mosquitoes were pinned and identified using a stereomicroscope and morphological keys (Belkin, 1962). Genitalia were removed from the few male mosquitoes collected and slide mounted according to Belkin (1962). The head/thorax of each female mosquito from each pool was severed from the abdomen following the methods described in Ishtiaq et al. (2008). DNA was extracted from both the abdomen and head/thorax pools using the Wizard SV Genomic DNA Purification kits (Promega Corporation, Madison, WI) with the modification of adding an additional 20 μl of Proteinase K prior to incubation and homogenization with a heat-sealed pipette tip (Njabo et al. 2009). All polymerase chain reactions (PCR) were carried out in a 25 μl reaction mixture containing 10–100 ng of genomic DNA (2 μg of template DNA), 10 mMTris-HCl (pH8.3), 50 mMKCl, 3.0 mMMgCl, 0.4 mM of each dNTP, 0.4 mM of each primer, 5 μl of CL buffer (Qiagen, Valencia, CA), and 0.5 units Taq (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). For mosquito mtDNA sequence analysis, we amplified from four pools of abdomens ∼654 bp of the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase subunit 2 gene (COII) by using the thermocycler protocols and the forward primer SCTL2-J3037 from Bataille et al. (2009b) and Cook et al. (2009), along with a modified reverse primer (5’-GATTTAAGAGATCATTACTTGC-3’; Bataille et al. 2009b). We also amplified ∼610 bp of the NADH dehydrogenase subunit 5 gene (ND5) using the ND5 and tRNAPhe primers and thermocycler protocols from Krzywinski et al. (2001). The DNA extracted from head/thorax and abdomen mosquito pools was then screened for both Plasmodium and Haemoproteus parasite DNA using PCR. We amplified ∼ 750 bp of the parasite mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase subunit-b gene (cytb) using two sets of primers. The first set of primers used were L15183 and H15730 (Chasar et al. 2009, Fallon et al. 2003). The second primer set consisted of the nested primers HaemNF, HaemNR2, HaemF and HaemR2 as described in (Waldenström et al. 2004). All PCR products were screened and viewed on 1.8% agarose gels stained with ethidium bromide for examination of amplification products. Positive PCR products were bi-directionally sequenced by Elim Biopharmaceuticals Inc., Hayward, CA. From four pools of Ae. taeniorhynchus mosquitoes, we sequenced 654 bp of the COII gene and 588 bp of the ND5 gene. All amplicons sequenced where aligned and edited using Sequencher 4.8 (GeneCodes, Ann Arbor, MI). Because both amplicons had low levels of variation, they were combined for a total of 1,242 bp to increase the resolution power for data analysis. From mosquito abdomen and head/thorax pools that were positive for parasite DNA, we then sequenced 750 bp of the Plasmodium spp. cytb gene and edited using Sequencher 4.8 (GeneCodes, Ann Arbor, MI). Sequences were identified as Plasmodium spp. using the NCBI nucleotide Blast search and retrieved matches ranging from 97–99% in GenBank. Parasite sequences that differed by only 1 to 3 bp were considered distinct lineages (Ricklefs and Fallon 2002). Distinct lineages were then verified by repeating an independent PCR and sequencing analysis. Sequence chromatograms were visually inspected for presence of double peaks to ensure that no pools contained multiple distinct lineages of Plasmodium spp. All final sequences were deposited to GenBank with accession numbers HQ853668-HQ853680. And lastly, to estimate the proportion of infected individual mosquitoes from the pooled samples, the maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) was calculated using the equation MLE= 1 – (1 – number of positive pools/number of total pools)1/pool size (Gu et al. 2009). This number represents the expected proportion of infected individuals in the sample incorporating a correction for the pooling process. Phylogenetic relationships were analyzed using MrBayes version 3.1.2 (Huelsenbeck and Ronquist 2001) using the GTR+G model for both the mosquito and parasite phylogenetic hypotheses obtained from MrModeltest (Nylander 2004). In addition to Ae. taeniorhynchus COII and ND5 sequences obtained from Socorro Island (HQ853679- HQ853680), sequences from 32 mosquitoes originating from the Galápagos Islands, Latin America, and North America (Bataille et al. 2009b) were obtained from Genbank (accession numbers FM992116-FM992321). The COII and ND5 genes were considered a single dataset since they were characterized by the same nucleotide frequencies and the best-fit nucleotide substitution model. Due to the lack of an appropriate outgroup, we constructed an unrooted tree. Such an approach was not possible for Cx. quinquefasciatus because we did not have sufficient sequence data for this species. Plasmodium spp. mitochondrial cytb sequences were analyzed from 11 distinct lineages from Socorro Island and 34 sequences that were downloaded from Genbank. Genbank Plasmodium spp. sequences were from American mainland (Kimura et al. 2006), South Pacific (Ishtiaq et al. 2008), Japanese (Ejiri et al. 2008), and African parasite samples (Beadell et al. 2009, Chasar et al. 2009). Their respective accession numbers are provided in Figure 3. Plasmodium gallinaceum was used as an outgroup lineage. Two Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulations were run simultaneously for ten million generations with sampling every 200 generations generating 100,000 trees. The first 25,000 trees were discarded from the sample as the “burn-in” period that accounted for 25% of the trees. The remaining trees were used to construct a majority rule consensus tree and to calculate posterior probabilities of the individual clades (Labarthe et al. 1998). Bayesian phylogeny of 45 mitochondrial cytochrome b Plasmodium spp. lineages found in mosquitoes and one Plasmodium gallinaceum lineage as the outgroup. The Bayesian posterior probabilities are depicted at each node. Lineages obtained from Socorro Island are delineated by the name SocP and are in bold. All other Plasmodium spp. lineages are delineated by the host name in which the parasite was found, followed by the geographical region in which it was collected in parentheses, if available, and by the Genbank accession numbers. Mosquitoes were observed and collected at only two of the five sampling sites, Playa Blanca (Site 3) and the pier (Site 5; Figure 1). From these two sites a total of 1,300 mosquitoes were either pinned as voucher specimens (Bohart Museum, UC Davis) or pooled for DNA isolation. Two species were identified; Culex quinquefasciatus Say, 1823 and the black salt marsh mosquito Aedes (Ochlerotatus) taeniorhynchus (Wiedemann, 1821). Identification of Cx. quinquefasciatus as a member of the Culex pipiens complex was confirmed by morphology of male genitalia (DV/D index) as described by Cornel et al. (2003). Cx. quinquefasciatus was only collected at the pier (site 5) and consisted of 13 specimens, two of which were males. Ae. taeniorhynchus was by far the most abundant species and consisted of the remaining 1,287 specimens pooled or pinned, which in fact represented only a fraction of the total numbers collected of this species. We are unable to confirm potential breeding sites since no larvae were collected, but based on the location where the two mosquito species were collected (Figure 1), we can speculate where they might occur. Culex quinquefasciatus was only collected near the Naval base where some water cisterns are not properly covered, thus providing a potential breeding site for this mosquito species (Belkin et al. 1970). The pier also harbored Ae. taeniorhynchus, a mosquito known for breeding in transient pools of salt and brackish water in low-laying coastal areas (Belkin et al. 1970). Aedes taeniorhynchus was also collected at Playa Blanca, a cove surrounded by Conocarpus erectus mangrove and temporary pools of brackish water. The volcanic nature of Socorro Island results in uneven terrain that provides ample opportunity for pools to form during rains and after high tides, which Ae. taeniorhynchus may use as breeding sites. Female mosquitoes were pooled to create 61 separate head/thorax and abdomen pools of Ae. taeniorhynchus (20 in each) and one pool each of 11 Cx. quinquefasciatus head/thorax and abdomens for DNA analysis. Just over half of the Aedes abdomen pools (37/61) tested positive for parasite DNA, yielding a maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) of 4.8%, while the single Culex abdomen pool tested positive for parasite DNA yielding an MLE of 100%. Only one of 61 Aedes head/thorax pools tested positive for parasite DNA yielding an MLE of 0.08%. Phylogenetic relationships among the Ae. taeniorhynchus mosquitoes from Socorro Island, Galápagos Islands, and the American mainland (Figure 2) reveal five distinct clusters of Aedes lineages: I. the Atlantic coast and Gulf of México, II. the Galápagos Islands, III. the Pacific coast, IV. Latin America, and V. Socorro Island. The Aedes lineage found on Socorro Island interestingly clustered with a lineage from the Gulf of México (Lou6 from Louisiana, U.S.A.). We should point out that the sequences used for the Socorro Island Ae. taeniorhychus were derived from four pools of 20 mosquitoes in each. Each pool produced amplicons of identical sequence for both ND5 and CO II genes. Bayesian phylogeny of the combined dataset of the ND5 and COII genes of Aedes taeniorhynchus. The Bayesian posterior probabilities are depicted at each node. In total, 11 distinct Plasmodium Cytb lineages were isolated. No Haemoproteus spp. were detected in the mosquitoes. Phylogenetic relationships among Plasmodium spp. found in mosquitoes from Socorro Island and those found in the American mainland, South Pacific, Japan, and Africa are depicted in Figure 3. The tree shows that Aedes isolates SocP1 and SocP8 fell in clade IV and SocP7 fell into clade III. SocP11, which was found in the only Culex pool, fell in clade II. Lineage SocP1 was the most abundant parasite in mosquitoes sampled; it was found in 25 out of 61 Aedes pools and it included the single positive thorax/head Aedes pool. The remaining seven lineages were all found in a monophyletic clade (II in Figure 3) with Plasmodium spp. found in birds of Africa. Our study provides significant documentation of the mosquito fauna on Socorro Island. The species collected were Cx. quinquefasciatus and Ae. taeniorhynchus, both of which occur on the Galápagos Islands (Bataille et al. 2009b). Cx. quinquefasciatus, reported for the first time on Socorro Island, is a known vector for avian pox, West Nile virus (WNV), and avian malaria in Hawaii (Atkinson et al. 1995, Van Riper et al. 1986, Warner 1968). Ae. taeniorhynchus, on the other hand, has not been implicated as a competent vector for avian malaria, but is a known vector of dog heartworm (Dirofilaria immitis) in Latin America (Labarthe et al. 1998) and a competent vector for St. Louis encephalitis (Nayar et al. 1986) and West Nile viruses (Nayar et al. 1986, Turell et al. 2001). We cannot absolutely confirm that these are the only two species on Socorro Island, as we did not place traps in a systematic manner to cover every habitat on the island. Furthermore, most trapping nights were windy and not entirely conducive to optimal mosquito capture. Distribution patterns of these two mosquito species on Socorro Island differed. Cx. quinquefasciatus were collected only at the human-inhabited site at the pier near the Mexican Naval Station. This is consistent with findings on the Galápagos Islands where Cx. quinquefasciatus was also found only near human settlements, and that they are recent introductions. As in the Galápagos Islands (Bataille et al. 2009a, Bataille et al. 2009b), rainfall on Socorro Island is low, resulting in a scarcity of fresh water sources especially on lower altitude vegetation types (e.g., Flores-Palacios et al. 2009). Ae. taeniorhynchus was widely distributed along the coast of Socorro Island and was not caught inland nor above 200 m. This differs from the findings on the Galápagos Islands where Ae. taeniorhynchus were found up to 20 km from the coast and up to an altitude of 700 m. This unusual mosquito distribution led Bataille et al. (2009b) to suggest that Galápagos Ae. taeniorhynchus have undergone adaptations in breeding and radiated out of solely salt marshes into other breeding sites. This occurred over a period of 200,000 years, an estimate for the introduction of this species into the Galápagos Islands (Bataille et al. 2009b). On Socorro Island, Ae. taeniorhynchus shares a more similar biology to mainland mosquitoes where it is rare to be found >6 km from the coast line, and if they are seen inland, it is only to breed (Nielsen and Nielsen 1953, Provost 1951). Our phylogenetic analysis of the ND5/COII genes (Figure 2) suggests that Ae. taeniorhynchus colonized Socorro Island more recently than the Galápagos Islands, as their sequences aligned most closely with a lineage found in the Gulf of México. These mosquitoes were most likely introduced by human activity, as was surmised with Culex mosquitoes from the Galápagos (Bataille et al. 2009b), but there is no documentation of when this may have occurred. Our results provide evidence that several Plasmodium species occur on Socorro Island, but whether Cx. quinquefasciatus and Ae. taeniorhynchus are the transmitting vectors of all the lineages is not clear. Most Plasmodium spp. isolates were obtained from pools of mosquito abdomens, which does not verify their competence as vectors. To confirm vector competence, infective sporozoites must at least be detected in mosquito salivary glands (Njabo et al. 2009). One Plasmodium isolate was obtained from a head/thorax of an Aedes pool that lacked a recent blood meal, which suggests that Ae. taeniorhynchus could transmit Plasmodium spp. on the island. This is the first study providing evidence that Ae. taeniorhynchus might be a competent vector for avian malaria. The phylogenetic tree of the parasite lineages (Figure 3) found in the mosquitoes illustrates the diversity of the Plasmodium spp. on Socorro Island. All distinct lineages found on this island did not match any other Plasmodium spp. lineages found on GenBank, suggesting that the Socorro Plasmodium spp. may be unique to this island. Clade I was composed of seven distinct parasite lineages found on Socorro Island along with three Plasmodium spp. that have been described from avian populations of Africa. Although there is one endemic lizard present on the island (Urosaurus auriculatus) (Brattstrom 1990), none of the 11 Plasmodium distinct lineages fell into the clade with two known Plasmodium spp. to infect reptiles; Plasmodium mexicanum and Plasmodium chiricahuae. This indicates that the trapped mosquitoes relied on avian populations as their main source of blood meals. However, we were unable to analyze blood meals for host identities due to the lack of recently blood-fed trapped mosquitoes during our collection. Moreover, due to the low support for the SocP11 placement in Clade II (Figure 3), which is the parasite lineage isolated in the only Culex pool, we are unable to make any assumptions of how it is related to the other Plasmodium lineages. In order to protect the endangered avifauna of Socorro Island, and to prevent further extinctions, mosquito populations should be monitored continuously and control measures should be incorporated in the management plans of this Biosphere Reserve. Although it is unclear whether Ae. taeniorhynchus is a competent vector for avian malaria, it should be considered a serious threat to the avifauna of Socorro Island. If Ae. taeniorhynchus were to move inland, threatened birds that currently reside away from the coastline might be exposed to Plasmodium spp. Dispersal patterns of native birds require further study to help design epidemiological models to estimate disease risk and spread across the island. At this time, with a combination of timely research and sound management practices, there exists an opportunity to avert the scenario presented to the Hawaiian Islands: the collapse of an insular endemic avifauna. We offer our sincere gratitude and recognition to the Secretaría de Marina – Armada de México, in particular, to Admiral Ezequiel Ramiro Bordonave, Captain Pedro Villaciz León and the military personnel stationed at Socorro Island for their hospitality and logistical support, without which this study would not have been possible.

",,,,"Summary The Bristle-thighed Curlew Numenius tahitiensis is a rare shorebird that breeds in western Alaska and winters on oceanic islands in the tropical and subtropical Pacific Ocean. Before human colonization, the islands on which curlews winter were devoid of terrestrial predators, allowing curlews to evolve a rapid moult during which about 50% of adults become flightless. Especially when flightless, these birds are vulnerable to harvest by humans and to predation by introduced mammals such as dogs and cats. On atolls where they are harvested by humans, curlews tend to occur only on uninhabited islets. Consequently, human encroachment in Oceania has probably reduced Bristle-thighed Curlew numbers and altered winter distribution of the species. Future studies should (1) identify concentrations of wintering curlews, focusing in the Tuamotu Archipelago; (2) determine whether migratory stopover sites exist in the central Pacific between Hawaii and the southern end of the wintering grounds; and (3) establish a monitoring programme to assess population trends in several parts of the winter range. A comprehensive plan is needed to provide for the existence of predator-free islands throughout key portions of the winter range.

",,,,"Bahamian hutias (Geocapromys ingrahami) are the only endemic terrestrial mammal in The Bahamas and are currently classified as a vulnerable species. Drawing on zooarchaeological and new geochemical datasets, this study investigates human management of Bahamian hutias as cultural practice at indigenous Lucayan settlements in The Bahamas and the Turks & Caicos Islands. In order to determine how hutia diet and distribution together were influenced by Lucayan groups we conducted isotopic analysis on native hutia bone and tooth enamel recovered at the Major's Landing site on Crooked Island in The Bahamas and introduced hutias from the Palmetto Junction site on Providenciales in the Turks & Caicos Islands. Results indicate that some hutias consumed 13C-enriched foods that were either provisioned or available for opportunistic consumption. Strontium isotope ratios for hutia tooth enamel show a narrow range consistent with local origin for all of the archaeological specimens. In contrast, analysis of strontium isotopes in modern Bahamian hutia teeth from animals relocated to Florida from The Bahamas demonstrates that these animals rapidly lost their Bahamian signature and adopted a Florida signature. Therefore, strontium should be used cautiously for determining hutia provenance, particularly for individuals that were translocated between islands. Overall, our findings suggest that ancient human presence did not always result in hutia vulnerability and that the impact to hutia populations was variable across pre-Columbian indigenous settlements.

Subfossil specimens of early to late Holocene age from the Pamwak archaeological site on Manus Island are referred to the new species on morphological criteria; these confirm the species as a long-term resident of Manus Island. The new species is distinguished by its combination of large size; short tail; dorsal pelage that is coarse, spiny, and dark, with prominent black guard hairs; and sharply contrasting cream ventral pelage. Based on its overall body form, the species is almost certainly terrestrial. The dentition combines robust incisors with relatively small molars and the cranium displays a distinctive mélange of characters—including an elongate and anteriorly expanded rostrum and a mesopterygoid fossa that is narrow anteriorly and broadens to the rear. Sequence data from the mitochondrial control region and 3 nuclear genes place the new species as a highly divergent member of the Australo–Papuan Rattus radiation, with no identified close relative among sampled taxa. Morphological comparisons are made between the new species and other pertinent species of Rattus from the region, including R. sanila , a species known only from Late Pleistocene fossil to Late Holocene subfossil remains from an archaeological site on New Ireland. The conservation status of the new species is discussed in the light of a recent survey that failed to locate surviving populations in 2 areas of natural forest on Manus Island. Further survey work is urgently needed to identify any surviving populations and to assess the role of potential threats to the species.

We examined the use of sandy beach resources by the threatened island fox (Urocyon littoralis) on the California Channel Islands using scat analysis, surveys of potential prey, beach habitat attributes, and stable isotope analysis. Consumption of beach invertebrates, primarily intertidal talitrid amphipods (Megalorchestia spp.) by island fox varied with abundance of these prey across sites. Distance-based linear modeling revealed that abundance of giant kelp (Macrocystis pyrifera) wrack, rather than beach physical attributes, explained the largest amount of variation in talitrid amphipod abundance and biomass across beaches. δ13C and δ15N values of fox whisker (vibrissae) segments suggested individualism in diet, with generally low δ13C and δ15N values of some foxes consistent with specializing on primarily terrestrial foods, contrasting with the higher isotope values of other individuals that suggested a sustained use of sandy beach resources, the importance of which varied over time. Abundant allochthonous marine resources on beaches, including inputs of giant kelp, may expand habitat use and diet breadth of the island fox, increasing population resilience during declines in terrestrial resources associated with climate variability and long-term climate change.

",,,,"Forests are an important part natural ecosystems, by for example providing food, fiber, habitat, and biodiversity, all of which contribute to stable natural systems. Assessing and modeling the structure and characteristics of forests, e.g., Leaf Area Index (LAI), volume, biomass, etc., can lead to a better understanding and management of these resources. In recent years, Terrestrial Laser Scanning (TLS) has been recognized as a tool that addresses many of the limitations of manual and traditional forest data collection methods. In this study, we propose a density-based approach for estimating the LAI in a structurally-complex forest environment, which contains variable and diverse structural attributes, e.g., non-circular stem forms, dense canopy and below-canopy vegetation cover, and a diverse species composition. In addition, 242 TLS scans were collected using a portable low-cost scanner, the Compact Biomass Lidar (CBL), in the Hawaii Volcanoes National Park (HAVO), Hawaii Island, USA. LAI also was measured for 242 plots in the site, using an AccuPAR LP-80 ceptometer. The first step after cleaning the point cloud involved detecting the higher forest canopy in the light detection and ranging (lidar) point clouds, using normal change rate assessment. We then estimated Leaf Area Density (LAD), using a voxel-based approach, and divided the canopy point cloud into five layers in the Z (vertical) direction. These five layers subsequently were divided into voxels in the X direction, where the size of these voxels were obtained based on inter-quartile analysis and the number of points in each voxel. We hypothesized that the intensity returned to the lidar system from woody materials, like branches, would be higher than from leaves, due to the liquid water absorption feature of the leaves and higher reflectance for woody material at the 905 nm laser wavelength. We also differentiated between foliar and woody materials using edge detection in the images from projected point clouds and evaluated the density of these regions to support our hypothesis. Density of points, or the number of points divided by the volume of a grid, in a 3D grid size of 0.1 m, was calculated for each of the voxels. The grid size was determined by investigating the size of the branches in the lower portion of the canopy. Subsequently, we fitted a Kernel Density Estimator (KDE) to these values, with the threshold set based on half of the area under the curve in each of the density distributions. All the grids with a density below the threshold were labeled as leaves, while those grids above the threshold were identified as non-leaves. Finally, we modeled LAI using the point densities derived from the TLS point clouds and the listed analysis steps. This model resulted in an R 2 value of 0.88. We also estimated the LAI directly from lidar data using the point densities and calculating LAD, which is defined as the total one-sided leaf area per unit volume. LAI can be obtained as the sum of the LAD values in all the voxels. The accuracy of LAI estimation was 90%, with an RMSE value of 0.31, and an average overestimation of 9 % in TLS-derived LAI, when compared to field-measured LAI. Algorithm performance mainly was affected by the vegetation density and complexity of the canopy structures. It is worth noting that, since the LAI values cannot be considered spatially independent throughout all the plots in this site, we performed semivariogram analysis on the field-measured LAI data. This analysis showed that the LAI values can be assumed to be independent in plots that are at least 30 m apart. As a result, we divided the data into six subsets in which the plots were 30 m spaced. The R 2 values for these subsets, based on modeling of the field-measured LAI using leaf point density values, ranged between 0.84–0.96. The results bode well for using this method for efficient, automatic, and accurate/precise estimation of LAI values in complex forest environments, using a low-cost, rapid-scan TLS.

",,,,"Vegetation structural complexity is an important component of forest ecosystems, influencing biodiversity and functioning. Due to the heterogeneous distribution of vegetation elements, structural complexity underpins ecological dynamics, species composition, microclimate, and habitat diversity. Field measurements and Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data, such as airborne (ALS) and terrestrial (TLS), can assess structural characteristics of forest and agroforestry systems at various spatial scales. This assessment is urgently needed for monitoring ecosystem restoration in degraded lands (e.g., in oil palm landscapes), where it is not well-known how structural measures derived from these different approaches relate to each other. Here, we compared the degree of correlation between individual and multivariate datasets of vegetation structural complexity metrics derived from ALS, TLS, and ground-based inventory approaches. The study was conducted in a 140 ha oil palm monoculture, enriched with 52 plots in the form of tree islands representing agroforestry systems of varying sizes and planted diversity levels in Sumatra, Indonesia. Our datasets comprised 25 ALS, five TLS, and nine ground-based inventory metrics. We studied correlations among metrics related to traditional stand summary, heterogeneity, and vertical and horizontal stand structure. We used principal component analysis for data dimensionality reduction, correlation analysis to quantify the strength of relationships between metrics, and Procrustes analysis to investigate the agreement between datasets. Significant correlations were found between ALS and TLS metrics for canopy density (r = 0.79) and maximum tree height (r = 0.58) and between ALS and ground-based inventory measures of stand heterogeneity and height diversity (r between 0.60 and −0.63). Further, we observed significant agreements between the ordinations of multivariate datasets (r = 0.56 for ALS − TLS; and r = 0.46 for ALS – ground-based inventory). Our findings underline the ability of ALS to capture structural complexity patterns, especially for canopy gap dynamics and vegetation height metrics, as captured by TLS, and for measures of heterogeneity and vertical structure as captured by ground-based inventories. Our study highlights the strength of each approach and underscores the potential of integrating ALS and TLS with ground-based inventories for a comprehensive characterization of vegetation structure in complex agroforestry systems, which can provide guidance for their management and support ecosystem restoration monitoring efforts.

",,,,"Abstract. The mid-Pliocene is a valuable time interval for investigating equilibrium climate at current atmospheric CO2 concentrations because atmospheric CO2 concentrations are thought to have been comparable to the current day and yet the climate and distribution of ecosystems were quite different. One intriguing, but not fully understood, feature of the early to mid-Pliocene climate is the amplified Arctic temperature response and its impact on Arctic ecosystems. Only the most recent models appear to correctly estimate the degree of warming in the Pliocene Arctic and validation of the currently proposed feedbacks is limited by scarce terrestrial records of climate and environment. Here we reconstruct the summer temperature and fire regime from a subfossil fen-peat deposit on west–central Ellesmere Island, Canada, that has been chronologically constrained using cosmogenic nuclide burial dating to 3.9+1.5/-0.5 Ma. The estimate for average mean summer temperature is 15.4±0.8 ∘C using specific bacterial membrane lipids, i.e., branched glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers. This is above the proposed threshold that predicts a substantial increase in wildfire in the modern high latitudes. Macro-charcoal was present in all samples from this Pliocene section with notably higher charcoal concentration in the upper part of the sequence. This change in charcoal was synchronous with a change in vegetation that included an increase in abundance of fire-promoting Pinus and Picea. Paleo-vegetation reconstructions are consistent with warm summer temperatures, relatively low summer precipitation and an incidence of fire comparable to fire-adapted boreal forests of North America and central Siberia. To our knowledge, this site provides the northernmost evidence of fire during the Pliocene. It suggests that ecosystem productivity was greater than in the present day, providing fuel for wildfires, and that the climate was conducive to the ignition of fire during this period. The results reveal that interactions between paleo-vegetation and paleoclimate were mediated by fire in the High Arctic during the Pliocene, even though CO2 concentrations were similar to modern values.

",,,,"Aim
The Mediterranean Basin (MB) is a species-rich biogeographical region with many endemic taxa. We analysed the historical patterns of temporal and geographical diversification of Mediterranean Blaps (Tenebrionidae), a diverse group of flightless beetles, estimated their date of origin and colonization of the MB, and tracked temporal changes in diversification rates.

Location
Mediterranean Basin.

Methods
We reconstructed the phylogenetic relationships of Mediterranean Blaps using four mitochondrial genes and 47 morphological characters. Divergence-time estimates were investigated with a Bayesian relaxed clock approach that was calibrated with both fossil and geological constraints. Biogeographical analyses were performed using the dispersal–extinction–cladogenesis likelihood model associated with a stratified palaeogeographical scenario. Diversification rate analyses allowed the investigation of diversity dynamics through time as well as rate shifts during major Cenozoic climate events.

Results
The Bayesian relaxed clock analysis suggests that Blaps first appeared in the MB about 28 Ma. The most likely scenario is that Mediterranean Blaps originated in the Arabian and north-east African regions and then dispersed progressively westwards and northwards, using temporary land bridges to colonize the northern shores of the MB. Island endemics are more likely to be the products of recent dispersals than of old vicariance events. Birth–death analyses suggest that diversification rates in the Miocene and Pliocene are consistent with a ‘museum model’, in which most of the extant diversity is best explained by a steady accumulation of lineages under constant diversification rates. Although major Cenozoic climatic events do not seem to have influenced the diversification of Mediterranean Blaps, a decrease in diversification rates was detected during the Pleistocene.

Main conclusions
Our results suggest that Mediterranean Blaps lineages diversified between the Oligocene and the Pliocene, with current distribution patterns mostly accounted for by early vicariance and late dispersal events. Diversification rates were relatively constant through time, but decreased during Pleistocene glaciation cycles. This scenario may be applicable to other Mediterranean terrestrial animal taxa.","0305-0270

This region is facing an anthropogenic climate change, including a rise in mean temperature of between 2.2 and 5.1°C, a decline of 4-27% of annual rainfall during the XXIst century, with drastic changes in the pattern of rainfall distribution. According to this scenario, the region may be especially vulnerable, with probably more than 2,000 extinctions of plant species. Located in the Western part of the Mediterranean basin, the mountainous island of Corsica harbors a particularly rich flora, made of 2858 taxa of vascular plants, including 11% of endemics and 6% of Corsica-restricted taxa. Upon the expected climatic shift, Corsica island is a central area in terms of conservation of terrestrial plant diversity. In this context, a satisfactory evaluation of all realized attempts of plant conservation is crucial. This is the main goal of this first report presenting the assessment of sixteen years of in situ conservation operations that were carried out from 1984 to 2004 in Corsica. This paper gathers a set of 40 operations of plant population transfers in contexts of either restoration of rare and threatened habitat or safeguarding of populations of endangered plant taxa. All the transferred populations were protected (excepted Achillea maritima whose only picking in the intervention area is regulated) and part of the European Directive CE 92/43. All the operations except two came within the framework of the European Life program “Conservation des habitats naturels et des espèces végétales d’intérêt communautaire prioritaire de la Corse“ managed by the “Office de l’environnement de la Corse”. The two remaining operations, dealing respectively with Ophrys eleonorae and Achillea maritima conservation, were independently carried out by the French Forest Service (Office national des forêts) and the Conservatoire du littoral in Corsica. The data presented include 20 introductions, 18 population reinforcements and two in situ population transfers. Operations succeeded for 21 of them and failed for 16 of them. The three remaining operations could not be evaluated for various reasons. Among the 16 transferred taxa, four were phanerophytes (Juniperus oxycedrus subsp. macrocarpa, Genista aetnensis, Tamarix africana and Vitex agnus-castus), seven were hemicryptophytes (Anchusa crispa, Kosteletzkya pentacarpos, Lippia nodiflora, Naufraga balearica, Rouya polygama, Silene velutina and Woodwardia radicans) and three were chamephytes (Achillea maritima, Armeria pungens and Brassica insularis). The two remaining taxa were either geophyte (Ophrys eleonorae) or therophyte (Linaria flava subsp. sardoa). Interventions were carried out into coastal sandy (eight sites), riparian (three sites), flooded (two sites) and rocky (three sites) habitats. These operations provide new insights from methodological perspectives (intervention process, partner interactions, intervention modalities…) as well as enhance our knowledge of the biological models associated with moved populations (ecology and biology of rare Mediterranean species). The limits of these programs in terms of modalities of monitoring and data availability, as well as the way to improve the timing and the ability of partners to be involved in the process are exposed in order to optimize the success of future operations of habitat restoration.","0153-8756

Perhentian Besar with approximately 867 hectares is one of the inhabited island and become the centre of tourism besides Perhentian Kecil. Island is well known as a place for many endemic and endangered living organism as previously demonstrated on other similar forested islands in Southeast Asia. However, there is little attention and effort of protection has been received by the terrestrial ecosystems that reside nearby the coastal. Thus, the present study investigates on tree diversity, stand structure and community composition in the island of Perhentian Besar, Terengganu. Forest plot of 0.5 hectare was established to analyze the floristic composition of tree taxa. The plot was divided into 10 subplots of 25m x 20m. All trees with 5cm diameter breast height (dbh) and above were tagged, measured for dbh size, recorded and identified. Voucher specimens were taken for further verification purposes. A total of 102 tree species were recorded comprising of 28 families and 65 genera. Rubiaceae had the highest number of species (11 species) and with regards to relative dominance, Shorea leprosula (Dipterocarpaceae) gave the highest importance value index (IVi) for species with a value of 8.45%. The Shannon-Weiner Diversity Index (Hâ€™) was considered high in the present study with 3.94 (Hâ€™max = 4.62) and the Evenness Index (E) value of 0.85 indicated that all species in the present study are almost equally abundant. The forest stand structure had a reverse J-shaped curve for tree size-class distributions as frequently observed in many natural forests, which indicated that the forest stand in the study site had a good recruitment patterns and also a main feature of matured forest in Peninsular Malaysia. The present study will help us to understand the pattern of tree species composition, diversity and forest ecosystem dynamic in Pulau Perhentian Besar.Â Â Â

",,"Wiley
",,,,"Abstract Aim Species distribution models (SDMs) are widely used predictive tools to forecast potential biological invasions. However, the reliability of SDMs extrapolated to exotic ranges remains understudied, with most analyses restricted to few species and equivocal results. We examine the spatial transferability of SDMs for 647 non‐indigenous species extrapolated across 1,867 invaded ranges, and identify what factors may help differentiate predictive success from failure. Location Global. Time period Current. Major taxa studied Six hundred and forty‐seven terrestrial species; eight taxonomic classes. Methods We performed a large‐scale assessment of the transferability of SDMs using two modelling approaches: generalized additive models (GAMs) and MaxEnt. We fitted SDMs on the native ranges of species and extrapolated them to exotic ranges. We examined the influence of general factors and factors related to biological invasions on spatial transferability. Results Despite both modelling approaches performing well in the range of the species used for fitting, we observed moderate to low spatial transferability on average (mean area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUC] ~ .7) when extrapolating to their invaded ranges. Transferability differed between taxonomic classes and invaded continents and was positively influenced by the performance of the model and environmental generalism in the native range, and the year of first record. Models performed worse with greater environmental coverage in the exotic range, gross domestic product and number of occurrences in the native range, geographic distance between ranges and when extrapolating to islands. Main conclusions After controlling for sampling bias, half of SDMs were only weakly predictive, which should affect how SDM‐based forecasts are interpreted. Performance differed based on characteristics of the data, species, and ranges, and can suggest when SDMs may be reliable and when we should be most cautious. These considerations touch directly upon the potential use of SDMs for management of biological invasions. We discuss possible mechanisms of these findings.

",,,,"Based on the bi-linearly interpolated meteorological reanalysis data from National Centers for Environmental Prediction, USA and by using the leaf area index data derived from the GIMMS NDVI to run the process-based Boreal Ecosystems Productivity Simulator (BEPS) model, this paper simulated and analyzed the spatiotemporal characteristics of the terrestrial ecosystem gross primary productivity (GPP) and net primary productivity (NPP) in East Asia in 2000-2005. Before regional simulating and calculating, the observation GPP data of different terrestrial ecosystem in 15 experimental stations of AsiaFlux network and the inventory measurements of NPP at 1300 sampling sites were applied to validate the BEPS GPP and NPP. The results showed that BEPS could well simulate the changes in GPP and NPP of different terrestrial ecosystems, with the R2 ranging from 0.86 to 0.99 and the root mean square error (RMSE) from 0.2 to 1.2 g C x m(-2) x d(-1). The simulated values by BEPS could explain 78% of the changes in annual NPP, and the RMSE was 118 g C x m(-2) x a(-1). In 2000-2005, the averaged total GPP and total NPP of the terrestrial ecosystems in East Asia were 21.7 and 10.5 Pg C x a(-1), respectively, and the GPP and NPP exhibited similar spatial and temporal variation patterns. During the six years, the total NPP of the terrestrial ecosystems varied from 10.2 to 10.7 Pg C x a(-1), with a coefficient of variation being 2. 2%. High NPP (above 1000 g C x m(-2) x a(-1)) occurred in the southeast island countries, while low NPP (below 30 g C x m(-2) x a(-1)) occurred in the desert area of Northwest China. The spatial patterns of NPP were mainly attributed to the differences in the climatic variables across East Asia. The NPP per capita also varied greatly among different countries, which was the highest (70217 kg C x a(-1)) in Mongolia, far higher than that (1921 kg C x a(-1)) in China, and the lowest (757 kg C x a(-1)) in India.

Large portions of the island have rarely been visited by ornithologists, however, and published natural history information is limited for many species. We conducted field surveys, interviews, and camera trapping on Makira from October 2015 to February 2016, including the first ornithological surveys in southern Makira. We identify minor differences between the bird communities in the southern and northern parts of the island and report on noteworthy natural history observations, including nest descriptions for Yellow-legged Pigeon (Columba pallidiceps) and Shade Warbler (Horornis parens). We did not detect 3 endangered terrestrial species (Makira Woodhen [Gallinula silvestris], Thick-billed Ground-Dove [Gallicolumba salamonis], and White-bibbed Ground-Dove [Gallicolumba jobiensis]), and all 3 are probably extinct on Makira. High numbers of invasive species are present throughout Makira's forests, in particular rats (Rattus spp.), which were found at all our survey sites and accounted for nearly 34% of camera trap images, and cats (Felis catus), which were recorded at all sites that received >75 camera-days of survey effort. The widespread presence of invasive predators in remote and unlogged forests helps explain the disappearance of native species from the island. Controlling unregulated logging and protecting the remaining lowland forest in southern Makira is now the most important priority for biodiversity conservation on the island. In addition to our own observations, we review findings from other ornithological fieldwork on Makira and provide a comprehensive list of 114 bird species recorded on the island.","1559-4491

",,"Frontiers Media
",,,,"Seabirds provide inter-habitat connectivity by transporting vast quantities of nutrients from their pelagic feeding grounds to terrestrial and marine ecosystems via their nitrogen and phosphorous rich guano. However, it remains unclear whether seabird nutrients are cycling through many nearshore, temperate systems, such as United Kingdom (UK) rocky shores. Furthermore, it also remains unknown how seabird nutrient subsidies impact biodiversity, productivity, and recolonisation rates in UK rocky intertidal systems. Here, the impact of seabird nutrient subsidies to the Farne Islands, Northumberland, areas of high seabird densities during their breeding seasons, was compared to nearby low seabird density areas on the Northumberland coast. Estimated seabird derived nitrogen inputs and seabird densities were 420-1,025 and 949-2,279 times higher, respectively, on seabird islands than on the mainland. Seabird derived nutrient inputs led to substantially enriched nitrogen stable isotope (δ 15 N) values and total nitrogen content in terrestrial soil, plants, and lichen, and intertidal barnacles, and limpets, and higher δ 15 N values in macroalgae and turf algae. The seabird islands contained marginally greater algal species richness and higher densities of intertidal predators. However, other drivers could not be ruled out, such as nutrient inputs from mainland sources and marginally higher wave exposure at the mainland sites. No difference in limpet size, biomass, or abundance existed between the seabird islands and the mainland. On plots artificially cleared to simulate a disturbance event, barnacles recolonised faster on mainland sites. These findings provide evidence that seabird vectored pelagic nutrients are incorporated into terrestrial and intertidal ecosystems of UK islands, and therefore play an important role in facilitating ecosystem connectivity.

The family Echiniscidae is one such lineage; it is one of the most diverse groups of limno-terrestrial tardigrades and can be characterized as having achieved great evolutionary success. In this contribution, using populations representing several species that originated from the Indomalayan region, we reconstructed phylogenetic affinities within Nebularmis , a recently erected genus within the Echiniscus lineage. Nebularmis auratus sp. nov. and Nebularmis burmensis sp. nov. are described from the Eastern Yoma Mountains and the Shan Hills (Myanmar), Nebularmis bhutanensis sp. nov. is described from the Eastern Himalayas (Bhutan), and Nebularmis indicus sp. nov. is described from the foothills of the Western Ghats (Goa, India). Moreover, males are reported in populations of the last two species. All known members of the genus can be phenotypically differentiated based on minute details of their dorsal sculpture and claws. Moreover, a very wide tropical distribution is demonstrated for Nebularmis cirinoi , recorded for the first time from islands of the Malay Archipelago. Furthemore, novel morphological, genetic, and geographic data allowed for the clarification of the generic diagnosis. Currently available data favor a scenario under which Nebularmis evolved in Southeast Asia and later dispersed to other regions of the globe.

",,,,"The isopod sub-order Oniscidea includes over 3,700 species and is known to occur in all terrestrial environments, except those at extreme elevations and polar latitudes. Current estimates of the biodiversity of the Oniscidea may be underestimates, as recent molecular studies have uncovered high levels of cryptic diversity in several taxa in the sub-order. High levels of cryptic diversity have been found in coastal species, species from remote and isolated regions, and species with complex taxonomic histories. Alloniscus oahuensis is a good candidate to harbor cryptic diversity, as it is a coastal isopod species with a geographic range that spans several remote and isolated archipelagos in the Pacific Ocean and has a complex taxonomic history. In this study, we used sequences for three mitochondrial genes and one nuclear gene to determine whether A. oahuensis harbors highly divergent lineages that may represent cryptic species. By characterizing 60+ A. oahuensis individuals from 17 localities from various Pacific Ocean archipelagos, we uncovered two deeply divergent lineages with disjunct distributions. The levels
of genetic divergence observed amongst the two lineages match or exceed those reported across other cryptic species in the Oniscidea, suggesting that A. oahuensis may represent a cryptic species complex in need of a taxonomic revision. The extremely low lineage diversities within A. oahuensis indicate that the lineages may have spread across the Pacific Ocean recently, potentially due to anthropogenic activity.",,,,,,"https://doi.org/10.6620/zs.2023.62-14

We assessed spatial similarities between mainland yellow-eyed penguin marine distribution and resources (prey), risks (fisheries interactions), and areas of refugia (marine protected areas, MPAs). We determined if suitable penguin foraging habitat, based on environmental predictors using a Maxent species distribution model (SDM), also supports a high diversity of key prey species identified using a stacked SDM. We also created a novel index to predict areas of potential commercial fisheries interactions and mapped the overlap of penguin distribution and MPAs. Areas along the middle of the continental shelf had the highest prey diversity and probability of penguin presence, which overlapped with gillnet fisheries in these regions. Suitable penguin habitat also overlaps with trawl fisheries inshore along much of the South Island coast. <1 % of the penguin range overlaps with current MPAs, and the proposed South-East Marine Protected Areas network would protect only 3.6 % of the current penguin foraging distribution. This study takes an ecosystem approach to assess complex interactions between commercial fisheries, marine ecosystems, and MPAs, which is urgently required for marine spatial planning and adaptive ecosystem management of not only this endangered seabird but for southeast New Zealand coastal habitat and biota also.

",,,,"Biodiversity exchanges across the Malesian region, linking the distinct biotas of Asia and Australia, have long attracted the curiosity of biologists. Tetrastigma (Vitaceae) has a wide distribution in Asia through the Sunda archipelago to Australia and provides a good case to elucidate floristic exchange between Asia and Australia. Tetrastigma species have fleshy fruits that are consumed by birds, representing a lineage with a predictable dispersal across island chains. We herein estimate the divergence times and reconstruct the biogeographic history of Tetrastigma with intensive taxon sampling (96 of approximately 120 species; >80%) using 10 chloroplast loci. The biogeographic history of Tetrastigma was reconstructed with 4-area and 6-area divisions by delineating the Sunda region into one or three areas of endemism based on a phylogenetic bioregionalization analysis and the geological history of Malesia. The 4-area division shows that Tetrastigma originated in continental Asia and diverged from the recently segregated genus Pseudocayratia in the early Eocene (49.43 Ma). Dispersal from continental Asia might have started in the late Eocene but mainly occurred in the last 10 Myr. Continental Asia is indicated to be the most important source area while Sunda is the biggest sink, with 16 of the 27 dispersal events inferred from continental Asia to Sunda. Only seven dispersal events are inferred arriving in the Sahul plate and one reverse dispersal from Sahul back to Asia. The 6-area division suggests that the Philippines have been an active junction between Asia and Australia. The biogeographic history of Tetrastigma illustrates an asymmetric floristic exchange between Asia and Australia in this genus, which has been facilitated by the formation of terrestrial connections in the late Miocene and the expansion of wet tropical forests across Wallace's Line and beyond.","0748-3007

The main drivers of these declines are a diverse set of factors relating to environmental change including habitat loss, pollution, and climate change. In 2019 and 2020, we surveyed 118 and 90 islands, respectively, in southern Finland’s archipelago for occupancy of Parnassius apollo larvae and counted the abundance of their host plant Hylotelephium telephium . Compared with historical data (1997–2003), the occupancy of Apollo butterfly larvae has decreased remarkably from about 75% to about 20% of islands and abundance declined as well. However, the abundance of their host plant has not changed. Occupancy models showed that the present occupancy probability is not affected by host plant numbers, and shows substantial colonization-extinction dynamics making the population vulnerable to stochastic extinction. Implications for insect conservation Our results show that this Apollo butterfly population is declining, and conservation actions are needed.

",,,,"New Guinea is the largest tropical island in the world and hosts immense endemic biodiversity. However, our understanding of how the gradual emergence of the terrestrial ecosystems of the island over the last 40 Myr has generated this biological richness is hampered by poorly documented species diversity and distributions. Here, we address both these issues through an integrative taxonomy and biogeographical approach using Hylophorbus, a New Guinea-endemic genus of frogs with 12 recognized species. We delimited candidate species by integrating mitochondrial DNA, nuclear DNA, and bioacoustics, then investigated their evolutionary history. Our results suggest that the current taxonomy of the genus misses true species diversity by ≥3.5-fold. Nevertheless, most candidate species (27) remain unconfirmed because of missing data, whereas five were identified unambiguously as undescribed (we describe three of these formally). Time-calibrated phylogenetic analyses suggest that Hylophorbus diversification began ~9 Mya in the northern or eastern portion of New Guinea. It would appear that lineages dispersed to new terrestrial habitats in the west, notably uplifted by the central range orogeny, until eventually reaching the Bird’s Head during the Mio-Pliocene (7–5 Mya). Conversely, a past barrier appears to have prevented north–south dispersal. These data suggest that new habitat availability has primarily driven the diversification of Hylophorbus.","0024-4082

",,,,"Abstract. Around 60 % of all bat species occur in islands, and nearly one in four is an insular endemic. Bats are often the only native terrestrial mammals in oceanic islands, and despite increasing anthropogenic pressures, little is known about the distribution, natural history, and population status of most insular bat populations. The sub-tropical archipelago of Madeira is composed of the volcanic islands of Madeira, Porto Santo, and Desertas and is home to the Macaronesian endemic Pipistrellus maderensis, to the endemic subspecies Nyctalus leisleri verrucosus, and to Plecotus austriacus. Pipistrellus maderensis is known to both Madeira and Porto Santo, whereas the other two species have only been recorded in the former. However, no bats have been recorded in Porto Santo for over 15 years, raising fears that bats are probably extinct in the island. In July 2021, we conducted an island-wide acoustic survey using AudioMoth passive acoustic recorders, leading to the detection of Pipistrellus maderensis in 28 out of the 46 sampling sites (60 %). The species' activity was strongly associated with artificial water sources, and genetic samples from six captured individuals revealed that the populations of Pipistrellus maderensis in Porto Santo and Madeira have a close phylogenetic affinity. Furthermore, using DNA metabarcoding, we found that the species feeds on a wide variety of insects, including several economically important pest species and disease vectors. These findings emphasise the need to target more conservation and research efforts towards extant island bat populations and the potential ecosystem services they provide.

",,,,"Abstract Quaternary environmental changes fundamentally influenced the genetic diversity of temperate-zone terrestrial animals, including those in the Japanese Archipelago. The genetic diversity of present-day populations is taxon- and region-specific, but its determinants are poorly understood. Here, we analyzed cytochrome b gene ( Cytb ) sequences (1140 bp) of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) to elucidate the factors determining the genetic variation in three species of large moles: Mogera imaizumii and Mogera wogura , which occur in central and southern mainland Japan (Honshu, Shikoku, and Kyushu), and Mogera robusta , which occurs on the nearby Asian continent . Network construction with the Cytb sequences revealed 10 star-shaped clusters with apparent geographic affinity. Mismatch distribution analysis showed that modes of pairwise nucleotide differences (τ values) were grouped into five classes in terms of the level, implying the occurrence of five stages for rapid expansion. It is conceivable that severe cold periods and subsequent warm periods during the late Quaternary were responsible for the population expansion events. The first and third oldest events included island-derived haplotypes, indicative of the involvement of land bridge formation between remote islands, hence suggesting an association of the ends of the penultimate (PGM, ca. 130,000 years ago) and last (LGM, ca. 15,000 years ago) glacial maxima, respectively. Since the third event was followed by the fourth, it is plausible that the termination of the Younger Dryas and subsequent abrupt warming ca. 11,500 years ago facilitated the fourth expansion event. The second event most likely corresponded to early marine isotope stage (MIS) 3 (ca. 53,000 years ago) when the glaciation and subsequent warming period were predicted to have influenced biodiversity. Utilization of the critical times of 130,000, 53,000, 15,000, and 11,500 years ago as calibration points yielded evolutionary rates of 0.03, 0.045, 0.10 and 0.10 substitutions/site/million years, respectively, showing a time-dependent manner whose pattern was similar to that seen in small rodents reported in our previous studies. The age of the fifth expansion event was calculated to be 5800 years ago with a rate of 0.10 substitutions/site/million years ago during the mid-Holocene, suggestive of the influence of humans or other unspecified reasons, such as the Jomon marine transgression.

",,,,"Invertebrates are key to island ecosystems but impacts from invasive mammalian predators are not well documented or understood. Given this knowledge gap, we studied terrestrial arthropod communities in the presence of a common invasive rodent (house mice, Mus musculus) on a subtropical atoll—Midway Atoll National Wildlife Refuge (MANWR). Here, invasive mice recently began to attack and depredate nesting seabirds, prompting planning for a future mouse eradication. However, uncertainty remains regarding the ecosystem's response to mouse removal. As part of a pre-eradication investigation, we conducted a baseline survey of MANWR's arthropod community structure and diversity (at order level), comparing islands with and without mice. From April 2018 to February 2020, we used pitfall traps to monitor ground-dwelling arthropods on MANWR's Sand Island (mice present) and Eastern Island (mice absent). During our study, we captured over 450,000 specimens from 24 taxonomic units. Arthropods on MANWR form six community clusters and differ between islands and habitats. Richness is relatively similar among clusters and islands, but diversity of common and dominant arthropod taxa is significantly higher on Sand Island, as well as in anthropogenically-built habitats. Weather is not a strong environmental driver of arthropod communities; community structure and diversity vary only slightly throughout the year. Additionally, anthropomorphic landscape-level alteration of MANWR may still influence arthropod communities today. Continued monitoring and research will provide better insight into how arthropod communities recover following invasive mouse eradications. Our study contributes to the body of knowledge of arthropods in the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands, arthropod community ecology, and potential mouse impacts on islands.","0030-8870

",,,,"Plant communities form the structural and functional basis for nearly all terrestrial ecosystems. Good knowledge about plant communities is therefore necessary to understand and protect life on our planet. Journal of Vegetation Science publishes papers on all aspects of plant community ecology, with an emphasis on articles that develop new concepts and methods, test theory or identify general patterns. Our associate journal, Applied Vegetation Science, welcomes papers on vegetation management, restoration and survey. The general aim of the Journal of Vegetation Science is to advance plant community ecology, and we always examine critically whether or not a submission fits our scope. We want to be sure that when you open a fresh printed issue or click new content, you can find inspiring papers on plant community ecology. Most submissions are clearly within scope, as for studies exploring diversity and composition (taxonomic- or trait-based) of species assemblages within natural and semi-natural vegetation. We do not publish autecological studies of single (or a few selected) species, studies oriented on agricultural crops or plantation forestry, however, we do consider, for example, weed communities in croplands, spontaneous vegetation processes in forest plantations or experimental plant assemblages. A rule of thumb is that the work must advance our understanding of plant communities. Thus, we accept studies of how plant communities respond to herbivory, but we do not publish papers about herbivore communities if there is no link to plant community structure or diversity. Following tradition, we have published studies concerning lichen communities but have left other fungal studies to mycological journals. We do not discriminate against any spatial scale, as plant species co-exist across scales. Furthermore, many advances in vegetation science are linked to ecoinformatics by using vast amounts of data from a broad geographical range. We are open to innovation and integration. For example, we welcome studies using molecular methods in vegetation science, e.g. applying environmental genomics to determine species composition of co-existing roots that cannot be distinguished visually. Each year the Chief Editors select one paper for the Editors' Award. This is also a way to 'map' especially interesting topics in plant community ecology. After lively discussions of many papers, the winner for the last year has been decided. The Editors' Award for 2016 goes to Martin Zobel for his paper 'The species pool concept as a framework for studying patterns of plant diversity' (Zobel 2016). This is a Synthesis paper that summarizes and integrates work accumulated over the last few decades. Very often it is difficult to understand why so many, so few, or just particular species co-exist in a community, even if local environment and biotic interactions are all carefully considered. In such cases the species pool concept can be helpful: variation in local community patterns can be largely defined simply by the available species in the species pool. Thus, we need to know the size and sometimes also the composition of species pools for each of our study sites. Zobel stresses that progress in species pool studies has been impeded by methodological difficulties. By definition, a species pool contains both present species that can be observed, but also absent yet suitable species – dark diversity. How to 'observe' absent species? Zobel is optimistic that the necessary data are accumulating and that methods are developing. We highly appreciate such Synthesis papers that do not just collect and present existing knowledge, but also provide new insights. The runner-up was also a Synthesis paper by David Storch on the evergreen topic in community ecology: species–area relationship (SAR; Storch 2016). SAR in nested samples (e.g. vegetation descriptions and floristic surveys in increasing area) often exhibits a triphasic relationship: the increase in diversity is steeper at small and large scales and less steep at intermediate scales. In his paper Storch shows that this pattern can originate from simple geometric constraints. This, in turn, links SAR to β-diversity, species–abundance distribution, and the biodiversity–productivity relationship. In addition to Syntheses, we welcome scientific discussions as Forum papers. When selecting the award paper, two Forum pieces appeared on the shortlist. David Wardle questioned whether and how experiments could be used to explore plant diversity–ecosystem functioning relationships (Wardle 2016). Typically, ecosystem functioning experiments randomly combine different numbers of taxa from a common pool. Wardle discusses if such an approach mimics real ecosystems. He suggests a broader spectrum of approaches to study this topic. This was replied to by another Forum paper by a large group of authors led by Nico Eisenhauer (Eisenhauer et al. 2016). They appreciate that new and complementary experimental approaches are welcome, but stress that biodiversity–ecosystem functioning experiments have played an important role in understanding ecosystem responses to species gains and losses. Evidently we need diversity in biodiversity research since all approaches have strengths and limitations. From Research Articles we point out a study by Brody Sandel and co-authors (Sandel et al. 2016) who focused on functional traits in grass communities across various spatial scales. They compiled a huge database of functional traits for grass species of the world. Then they studied where and how many of these traits are distributed by using 'botanical countries' across the world, US counties and also >70 000 vegetation samples from the US. Plant ecologists have been interested on how different traits are related to each other when using single species as data points. Plant community ecologists examine trait composition in plant communities as the mean value over present species. Sandel et al. (2016) compared these two approaches. Overall, trait–trait correlations from community mean values usually reflected those found at the species level, but not always. Thus, community assembly has a role to play on how trait patterns emerge! Plant communities vary across our planet and so might the ecological properties of the corresponding ecosystems. We examined how well the articles published in the Journal of Vegetation Science cover the regional diversity of vegetation. We publish ca. 100 research articles per year, and we examined the study locations of these articles. We looked at papers from the last 8 yr. We extracted coordinates, or geocoded locations mentioned in abstracts. Some studies reported multiple study sites and we used all these coordinates. In total we extracted ca. 1200 locations. A few locations found themselves in the ocean, and we checked and corrected these manually. Often east and west were erroneously assigned, sometimes there were other errors. Thus, we urge our authors to provide accurate coordinates of the study sites when actual vegetation has been studied. Study sites from the Journal of Vegetation Science can be found on the map (Fig. 1). We are happy that our journal features studies from all continents, including Antarctica. At the same time, however, huge areas have few if any studies. We hope that the map will become more balanced in the future, with good quality submissions from underrepresented regions. Also, interesting scientific questions can be studied when collaboration is geographically broad. Different regions likely have different species pools, and typical ecological relationships detected in a well-studied region might not hold elsewhere, making the collaboration among vegetation scientists the best way to obtain a more general understanding of plant communities. At our journal we honour traditions but also welcome innovation. We continue to publish a printed journal version but will soon adopt a new style which works better in electronic media and promises smoother copy-editing. In doing so, we hope to put more emphasis on the scientific content and less on format issues. When you submit to our journal, please check the most recent author guidelines. We also aim to work quickly: in the past 12 mo the average time from submission to first decision decreased to less than a month. On average, editors take less than a week to select referees, and receive reviews within 3 wk. We are very grateful for our Associate Editors, Editorial Board members and referees for the fine job! An important way for authors to maximize the impact of their papers is to balance the main text and supplementary material. Shorter papers are easier for busy colleagues to read. We all tend to have long must-read lists, and long papers often wait at the bottom. At the same time, some readers need more details and it would be ideal if these were available in electronic appendices. Good papers need to be noticed quickly. From now our accepted papers appear online before copy-editing, within days after acceptance. These papers have the same DOI number as the final version. Further, the journal has its own Twitter account (https://twitter.com/JVegSci) where we can announce a selection of our most interesting papers, but you are welcome to distribute news about your own paper or a paper you read using any social media channel. We started our Editorial discussing the scope of our journal. Sometimes the Chief Editors have had a lively academic discussion over whether one or another paper fits the scope of the journal. We have now learned that we cannot provide fixed rules, and there are many borderline cases. When we have asked colleagues in the International Association for Vegetation Science (www.iavs.org) how to delimit plant community ecology, a reply was – 'It's easy, it's what the Journal of Vegetation Science or Applied Vegetation Science publish.' Thus, the 'mapping' of plant community ecology among neighbouring science fields can only be done in collaboration with our authors and editors. When you submit your work to us, please think how it will advance our knowledge of plant communities, and provide a short explanation in your cover letter. You are also most welcome to visit the IAVS annual symposia to meet other vegetation scientists. The next symposium will be on the island of Sicily, Italy, on 20–24 June 2017 and will focus on vegetation patterns in natural and cultural landscapes.

",,,,"The St Bathans Fauna, from sites near the village of St Bathans, Central Otago, South Island, is the first substantive pre-Quaternary terrestrial vertebrate fossil fauna discovered in New Zealand. This fauna derives from 33 sites or discrete sedimentary beds located in the lower 50 m of the lacustrine Bannockburn Formation, Manuherikia Group, and is generally accepted as local stage Altonian (19–15.9 Ma; Burdigalian, Early Miocene) in age. Investigations since 2001 have revealed an abundant and diverse fauna from over 9000 catalogued lots that is herein reviewed. Invertebrates notably include eight genera and species of terrestrial molluscs. Among vertebrates, freshwater fish remains dominate with 17 species evidenced by 16,500 analysed otoliths (genera Neochanna, Galaxias, Prototroctes, and Mataichthys) and many thousands of bones. Birds (minimally 45 species, several thousand bones) are the most common non-fish vertebrates, among which waterfowls dominate all assemblages (10 species). Co-occurring with these was a diverse herpetofauna, including undetermined crocodylians and a terrestrial turtle, both absent in Recent faunas. Significantly, the St Bathans Fauna evidences that Zealandia already had during the Early Miocene all New Zealand's 'old' endemic Recent taxa (sphenodontids, leiopelmatids, dinornithiforms, apterygids, aptornithids, strigopoid parrots, acanthisittids, and mystacinids). Furthermore, it includes Australasia's oldest ardeids, two flightless rallids, a novel higher landbird family, a greater diversity of bats, and terrestrial mammals. All sites reflect a single fauna, except that the ducks Manuherikia lacustrina (stratigraphically lower in section) and M. primadividua (higher) have a mutually exclusive distribution that is not yet correlated with any other biotic distribution differences.

",,"Wiley
",,,,"Increasingly, wildlife managers are turning to molecular genetics to aid in conservation efforts. While such approaches have been applied to large terrestrial and aquatic vertebrate species, their application to other traded organisms has not been extensively explored. Here, we examined the utility of these techniques for identifying source populations of aquarium ornamental invertebrates, using members of the Hawaiian atyid genus Halocaridina as a study system. These shrimps, restricted to anchialine habitats of the Hawaiian Islands, are popular in the aquarium trade due to their ability to survive in hermetically sealed containers for extended periods of time. However, commercial harvesting, coupled with habitat destruction and strong regional endemism, could lead to the depletion/extinction of unique populations. Because the land district of Kona, along the west coast of the island of Hawai'i, has the state's highest concentration of anchialine habitats, we hypothesized that commercially available Halocaridina originated from this region. To test this, mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I gene sequences from 96 individuals, obtained from six vendors, were compared with 580 homologous sequences from previous studies covering the known distribution range of Halocaridina. Recovery of identical, regional-specific haplotypes, network analyses and statistical assignment tests identified these commercially acquired specimens as belonging to either the Kona, Ka'ū, (western and southern coasts, respectively, island of Hawai'i) or Kina'u (southern coast, island of Maui) genetic groups of these shrimps. Although 39 of the 96 individuals originated from the Kona genetic group as hypothesized, our finding that commercially available Halocaridina are from three genetic groups spanning two islands suggests that other populations also warrant potential management consideration. While this study represents the first application of molecular genetics in identifying source populations of aquarium ornamental species, we feel that these techniques are amenable more broadly as they are dependent on only a few caveats.","1367-9430

Email: g.bellocchi@isci.it ABSTRACT: This paper examines the drought patterns in Italy for the period from 1961 to 2006. The condition of drought was considered from an agricultural perspective, using the variability in the annual yield of maize as an indication of climate patterns. A procedure is presented where weather datasets, a drought stress index (MCDI: Mediterranean crop drought index) and geo-spatial analysis are used to assess the spatial distribution and the general evolution of drought. The regional perspective presented characterizes the general climatology of Italy and compares the climate to a severe drought that occurred in 2003. This study identifies some areas (such as major islands, the central Tyrrhenian coast and south-eastern zones) where agricultural drought is likely to be a problem. In general, the temporal patterns outlined in this study indicate an increase in drought over Italy. Considering the poor resolution of global output results for regional and sub-regional assessments, the analysis carried out provides background data and a methodology for climatologists, ecologists and others interested in developing bio-climate patterns within large geographical regions.

",,,,"Azorean biodiversity is relatively well-known following important scientific contributions during the last three decades. These have set a comprehensive species checklist for the Archipelago, improved significantly the knowledge on species abundance, ecology and distribution and have contributed to define priorities for conservation management and scientific research. Nevertheless, despite these efforts, a key functional group - the pollinators - remains poorly known in Azores, including their occurrence in different habitat-types and islands. Insect pollinators play a key ecological role and a valuable ecosystem service being crucial to having basic information on their abundance, distribution and ecology and a good knowledge on the status of their populations, if we aim to ensure the long-term sustainability of terrestrial ecosystems. Furthermore, island ecosystems are facing significant pressures from land-use and climatic changes and, from the increasing arrival of alien species to these remote areas, presenting a pressing need to assess the effects of these factors on island pollinators and pollination. Here, we present an inventory of the pollinator species found in different habitat-types of Terceira along a gradient of disturbance and encompassing 30 sites distributed throughout the island. We identified 2547 pollinators from 40 taxa, mostly dipterans and hymenopterans and recorded novel information on species distribution and ecological associations. A high number of taxa are native species, including three Azorean endemics, but 14 species are alien to the Archipelago. The use of a combination of standardised sampling techniques allowed us to collect information on diverse pollinator groups, but, most importantly, the data collected will contribute to assess the impacts of human activities on pollinator abundance and richness and support decision-making on habitat management for pollinators in the Azores.

",,,,"Abstract The fossil record of terrestrial vertebrates from the Late Cretaceous of Antarctica is currently composed of non-avian and avian dinosaurs from the marine sediments of the James Ross Basin, Antarctic Peninsula (West Antarctica). Although two dinosaurian formational assemblages (Late Campanian/Early Maastrichtian and Late Maastrichtian) are known, the record is still scattered, and evolutionary scenarios are tentative. Ten non-avian dinosaurs have been reported from Coniacian to Maastrichtian deposits, along with possible sauropod footprints of Early Maastrichtian age from Snow Hill Island. Five avian dinosaurs have been recorded or described exclusively from the Maastrichtian. The presence of an advanced titanosaur with characteristic procoelous mid-caudal vertebrae in Snow Hill Island Formation at Santa Marta Cove implies that the group achieved a global distribution by the Late Campanian. The Late Campanian/Early Maastrichtian non-avian dinosaur (ankylosaurs, ornithopods and dromaeosaurid theropods) clades probably attained a near-cosmopolitan distribution before the Late Cretaceous, and some aspects of this hallmark ‘Gondwanan’ fauna may therefore reflect climate-driven provinciality, not vicariant evolution driven by continental fragmentation. Antarctic Late Cretaceous avian dinosaurs are rare. They are restricted to the Maastrichtian and consist of a cariamid?, gaviids, a charadriiform and the basal Anseriformes Vegavis , and provide the first strong evidence for a basal radiation of birds known to exist in the Cretaceous.

",,,,"Human activities are expected to result in extinction of many organisms in taxonomically neglected lineages; however, actually documenting these extinctions is very difficult for soft-bodied organisms that do not leave a subfossil record. Subfossil and historic records reveal that human-induced extinction has been particularly marked for gastropods and terrestrial vertebrates on Pacific islands, but whether human activities resulted in similar biodiversity loss in soft-bodied, taxonomically neglected animals (such as insects) remains unclear. However, in cases in which specialized plant-feeding insects leave diagnostic feeding damage on plants, herbarium specimens coupled with resurvey efforts may indicate potential extinctions or extirpations during historic times. Here, I report the discovery of leaf mines in herbarium specimens of the plant Phyllanthus wilderi (Phyllanthaceae: Glochidion sensu lato) from the island of Mangareva (Gambier Islands, French Polynesia). These mines were not rediscovered in recent surveys on Mangareva but are similar to those made today by leaf-mining moths (Lepidoptera: Gracillariidae) on many other islands in southeastern Polynesia. This is, to the best of my knowledge, the first report of a potential insect extinction from Mangareva, an island already well known for its history of anthropogenic habitat destruction and biodiversity loss. This result indicates that herbarium specimens may be used to identify potentially extinct and extirpated insect taxa. Future biodiversity surveys on Pacific islands and elsewhere should use herbarium specimens as a guide both to documenting potential extinctions and to search for rediscovery of rare taxa.","0030-8870

",,,,"Western Australia’s remote Kimberley coastline spans multiple Traditional Owner estates. Marine turtle nesting distribution and abundance in Indigenous Protected Areas and newly declared Marine Parks were assessed by aerial photogrammetry surveys for the Austral summer and winter nesting seasons. Images of nesting tracks were quantified in the lab and verified by ad hoc ground patrols. The rankings of log-scaled plots of track abundance and density give guidance to regional co-management planning. Spatial and temporal differences were detected in that remoter islands had higher nesting usage and few terrestrial predators. The surveys found year-round green turtle nesting peaking in summer, as well as spatial boundaries to the summer and winter flatback stocks. Summer surveys recorded 126.2 island activities per km and 17.7 mainland activities per km. Winter surveys recorded 65.3 island activities per km and quantified a known winter mainland rookery with 888 tracks/km. The three highest density rookeries were found to be winter flatback turtles at Cape Domett, summer green turtles at the Lacepede Islands and summer flatback turtles at Eighty Mile Beach. Moderate to lesser density nesting by summer green turtles and winter flatback turtles occurred in the North Kimberley offshore islands. Traditional Ecological Knowledge and ground-based surveys verified the harder-to-detect species (olive ridley or hawksbill turtles) with irregular nesting, low track persistence and non-aggregated nesting. Higher-density rookeries may provide locations for long-term monitoring using repeated aerial or ground surveys; however, the sparse or infrequently nesting species require insights gleaned by Tradition Ecological Knowledge. Common and conspicuous nesters are easily detected and ranked, but better-informed co-management requires additional ground surveys or surveys timed with the reproductive peaks of rarer species.

The 18S rRNA sequences revealed that the leeches share 99.9% identity with Haemadipsa rjukjuana (inhabiting Taiwan), and the CO1 sequences revealed that the leeches are very close to H. rjukjuana (inhabiting Taiwan). The CO1 sequences were separated into 2 categories, 1 with 94.6% and the other with 94.3% similarity to the H. rjukjuana L00115A (inhabiting Taiwan). This new finding of the land leech is the first record in Korea.

",,,,"On oceanic islands, strong human impacts on habitats, combined with introductions of exotic species, modify the composition of terrestrial bird assemblages and threaten their ecological functions. In La Réunion, an oceanic island located in the Madagascan region, a national park was established in 2007 to counter the ecosystem-level effects of three centuries of habitat conversion, native species destruction and exotic species introductions. Here, we investigated how bird assemblages were structured in these human-modified landscapes, 10 years before the national park set out its first conservation measures. We used a combination of multivariate statistics and generalized additive models to describe variations in the taxonomic and functional composition and diversity of 372 local bird assemblages, encompassing 20 species, along gradients of habitat composition and configuration. We found that native species were tied to native habitats while exotic species were associated with urban areas and man-modified landscape mosaics, with some overlap at mid-elevations. Species' trophic preferences were segregated along habitat gradients, but ecological traits had an overall weak role in explaining the composition of species assemblages. Hence, at the time of the survey, native and exotic species in La Réunion formed two spatially distinct species assemblages with contrasting ecological trait suites that benefited from antagonistic habitat compositions and dynamics. We conclude that our results support the analysis of historical data sets to establish reference points to monitor human impacts on insular ecosystems.

",,,,"Abstract Reliable information on population size is fundamental to the management of threatened species. For wild species, mark-recapture methods are a cornerstone of abundance estimation. Here, we show the first application of the close-kin mark-recapture (CKMR) method to a terrestrial species of high conservation value; the Christmas Island flying-fox (CIFF). The CIFF is the island's last remaining native terrestrial mammal and was recently listed as critically endangered. CKMR is a powerful tool for estimating the demographic parameters central to CIFF management and circumvents the complications arising from the species’ cryptic nature, mobility, and difficult-to-survey habitat. To this end, we used genetic data from 450 CIFFs captured between 2015 and 2019 to detect kin pairs. We implemented a novel CKMR model that estimates sex-specific abundance, trend, and mortality and accommodates observations from the kin-pair distribution of male reproductive skew and mate persistence. CKMR estimated CIFF total adult female abundance to be approximately 2050 individuals (95% CI (950, 4300)). We showed that on average only 23% of the adult male population contributed to annual reproduction and strong evidence for between-year mate fidelity, an observation not previously quantified for a Pteropus species in the wild. Critically, our population estimates provide the most robust understanding of the status of this critically endangered population, informing immediate and future conservation initiatives.

",,,,"“Nothing could possibly live there!” They believed. Indeed, until recently, few specialized cave- adapted animals were known from volcanic, tropical, or oceanic island caves, and plausible theories had been put forward to explain their absence. But assume nothing in science! One must illuminate, explore, and survey habitats before declaring them barren. Our understanding of cave biology changed dramatically about 50 years ago following the serendipitous discovery of cave-adapted terrestrial arthropods in Brazil and on the young oceanic islands of the Galápagos and Hawai‘i. These discoveries and subsequent studies on the evolutionary ecology of cave animals have revealed a remarkable hidden fauna and created new sub- disciplines within biospeleology. Biological surveys of caves in other regions have continued to expand our understanding of the evolution, adaptation, and ecology of the subterranean biome. We now predict that, rather than being relicts trapped in caves by changing climate, many animals actively colonized caves and adapted to exploit food resources wherever there were suitable subterranean voids. The physical environment in caves can be determined with great precision because the habitat is buffered by rock. Furthermore, the bizarre adaptations displayed by obligatory cave animals are similar across many taxonomic groups. These two characteristics make caves nearly ideal natural laboratories for studying evolution and ecology. However, to the untrained researcher, caves can appear hostile and dangerous, and in fact, fieldwork in caves requires a unique marriage of athletic ability and science. In other words, cave research is exciting! In this contribution, I describe the exploration, discovery, and research in tropical caves and describe the factors that delayed the recognition of a significant tropical cave fauna.

endangered species in China according to their   
conservation status,as well as describing their degree of threat, population size, threatening factors and approaches to conservation. Supported by GIS, a literature based analysis was carried out on the geographical distribution patterns of the endangered vertebrates in China (birds were excluded, but for simplification we refer to “endangered vertebrates” hereafter). The endangered vertebrates are distributed unevenly. The densest areas are located in Hengduan Mountains,Hainan Island,Xishuangbanna and the Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau. In contrast, the Northern China Plain, the eastern part of the Inner Mongolia Plateau, the Loess Plateau and the Northeast Plain lack endangered animals.   
Topographical factor is key to the distributions of the endangered vertebrate species. Mountains are often habitats for many ancient species. Many species rely heavily on specific moisture and temperature conditions, which limit their distribution ranges. Human activity is another important factor that affects the present   
geographical distributions of the endangered vertebrates. Those places with a long history of human exploitation   
lack endangered vertebrates. Modern environmental problems such as pollution, and impoldering of wetlands also pose great threats to wildlife. A total of 168 endangered vertebrates, which accounts for 51.5% of all endangered vertebrates (excluding coastal species and species endemic to Taiwan and Hongkong) occur in nine counti

",,,,"Floristic compositions of non-endemic plants of continental islands were related to the neighboring continents because non-endemic plant species had historically migrated to continental islands from source areas. This study attempts to identify source areas of a continental island by means of floristic analysis and to assess possible migration routes on the basis of geographical distribution ranges of plants. Large quantities of angiosperm data records were downloaded from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF). Similarity index and cluster analysis were used to identify the floristic similarities among 22 geographical localities of Taiwan (GLTs) and 34 terrestrial ecoregions in Asia. Geographical distribution ranges of non-endemic angiosperm species in Taiwan (NEASTs) were evaluated to mirror the possible migration routes from different source areas to Taiwan. There are 3275 angiosperm species in Taiwan derived from the dataset of GBIF. Among them, 847 are endemic and 2428 are NEASTs. Geographical distribution ranges of the 2428 NEASTs were categorized into 7 distribution groups. They were widely distribution from equator to Siberia (27 species), tropical ecoregions (345 species), tropical and subtropical ecoregions (663 species), tropical to temperate ecoregions (591 species), subtropical ecoregions (265 species), subtropical to temperate ecoregions (387 species), and temperate ecoregions (150 species). Results of similarity indices and cluster analysis demonstrated that high floristic similarities were observed among GLTs at lowland and southern Taiwan and tropical and subtropical ecoregions in Asia. GLTs at high mountains were assumed to have floristic similarity with temperate ecoregions in Asia, whereas the assumption was not supported by our analysis. It is partly because of that angiosperms with tropical and subtropical distributions extend their ranges from low to high elevations in Taiwan. Subtropical ecoregions at southern China and tropical ecoregions at Indochina were more important than temperate ecoregions on playing source areas of NEASTs. Geographical distribution ranges of NEASTs implied that most of the NEASTs were probably migrated from topical or subtropical ecoregions of Asian continent to Taiwan.

The results revealed that while the level of activity at any point in time is dependent upon operative levels of these environmental factors, it can also be strongly influenced by pretreatment. It is suggested that simple predictive models are not yet able to accurately describe levels of nitrogenase activity in nature and that estimates of N-input on an annual or seasonal basis may be precarious. Leaching of metabolites from, and decomposition of the thallus are the two principal potential pathways for nitrogen, subsequent to fixation by cyanophilic lichens.

Populations are distributed over small Indo-Pacific islands of the tropics, including Christmas Island (Indian Ocean). Although this species has served as a crustacean model to explore anatomical, physiological, and ecological aspects of terrestrial adaptations, few behavioral analyses of it exist. We used a GPS-based telemetric system to analyze movements of freely roaming robber crabs, the first large-scale study of any arthropod using GPS technology to monitor behavior. Although female robber crabs are known to migrate to the coast for breeding, no such observations have been recorded for male animals. In total, we equipped 55 male robber crabs with GPS tags, successfully recording more than 1,500 crab days of activity, and followed some individual animals for as long as three months. Besides site fidelity with short-distance excursions, our data reveal long-distance movements (several kilometers) between the coast and the inland rainforest. These movements are likely related to mating, saltwater drinking and foraging. The tracking patterns indicate that crabs form route memories. Furthermore, translocation experiments show that robber crabs are capable of homing over large distances. We discuss if the search behavior induced in these experiments suggests path integration as another important navigation strategy.

Although most leaf-toed gecko genera belong to independently derived lineages, recent studies support the monophyly of a circum-Indian Ocean group including four genera from disparate regions: the southern African genera Afrogecko and Cryptactites, the Malagasy genus Matoatoa, and the Australian genus Christinus. We obtained molecular and/or morphological data for most species in these genera to estimate phylogenetic relationships among constituent species and infer broad historical biogeographic patterns. Our results confirm that Afrogecko is not monophyletic, and that Christinus is embedded among African taxa. Afrogecko is comprised of three lineages, each of which is distinct in external features and osteology. Based on these results, we partition Afrogecko and recognize two new genera. Molecular clock analyses suggest divergences within the circum-Indian Ocean group are too recent for Gondwanan vicariance or hypothesized land bridges (e.g. Kerguelen Plateau) to account for the observed Africa/Madagascar/Australia distributional pattern. Ancestral area analyses support an origin of the clade in mainland Africa or Madagascar, and imply a dispersal event from southern Africa to Australia, similar to those observed in some plant and arthropod taxa, but otherwise unknown among non-volant terrestrial vertebrates. Dispersal was likely via a southern route and may have been facilitated by island hopping using Antarctica or other southern landmasses available in the mid-Cainozoic.","1477-2000

",,,,"The land operculates of the Afrotropical Region represent a noticeably small minority
among the land snails. As regards distribution, these snails are absent from most of the
desert and semidesert areas (South West Africa and areas bordering on the Sahara)
with the exception of the Horn of Africa. The less than 70 known species are little
diverse, representing 4 families and 9 genera, 1 family and 5 genera of which are
endemic (almost all species are endemic). The continental taxa usually have small shells
(major diameter not more than 32.0 mm, but generally much smaller), while island
dwellers east of the continent reach considerably larger sizes (major diameter up to 55.5
mm). The terrestrial prosobranchs are strikingly diverse on these islands, particularly
on Madagascar; some families on the islands are not known to occur on the mainland
and are of Asiatic derivation. Conditions of island life may have contributed to factors
such as increased diversity and size. Low diversity and small size on the continent may
be due to competition with land pulmonates as suggested by CAIN(1978); whatever the
reasons, the terrestrial operculates of the African continent in some respects are ab-
errant from those found elsewhere in the world","0028-2960

These habitats provide essential resources for the local terrestrial vertebrate fauna, although increasing anthropogenic disturbances pose a serious threat to existing wildlife populations. Here, we provide an inventory of terrestrial vertebrate fauna of caves and limestone forests of three ecotourism areas within the southern Sierra Madre in CALABARZON Region, Philippines. A combination of various field survey methods (i.e. line transect surveys, mist netting, opportunistic catching, cage trapping) was conducted from 2021-2023 to determine the diversity of amphibians, reptiles, non-volant mammals, bats, and birds in the three sites. A total of 160 species (13 amphibians, 23 reptiles, 98 birds, four non-volant mammals, and 22 bats) were recorded in this study. Endemicity was high at 46% with 56 Philippine endemics, including 21 species endemic to the Greater Luzon Island. In addition, we recorded 18 locally and globally threatened species based on the IUCN Red List and DENR-DAO 2019-09. The high species richness and presence of threatened species underline the high conservation value of the study areas. However, unmanaged growth of tourism and habitat fragmentation threaten their biodiversity. The data generated will be used to guide the classification, proper management, and conservation of these karst areas, caves, and their resources by the national government and local government units.","0031-7683

The lack of baseline information is therefore a major hindrance to the construction of management plans. Here we present detailed monitoring data on the species composition and numbers of each species for the island of Anegada, BVI. We surveyed the birds of Anegada between November 2003 and March 2005 utilising a combination of coastal transects, wetland bird counts, point counts, and species-specific survey methods for nocturnal species. A total of 99 different species were recorded, with a large increase in the number of species and number of individuals centred around peak migration in September. Although there is a depauperate terrestrial bird community consisting of predominately generalist species, it holds important populations of regional avifauna. For example, it hosts five regionally important breeding seabird colonies and its wetlands provide an important stop-over and over-wintering site for many species of shorebirds and waterbirds. In addition, the Eastern salt ponds are also the only breeding site for the greater flamingo, Phoenicopterus ruber, within the territory. We discuss our findings within the current framework of regional conservation and provide recommendations for the implementation of a territory wide monitoring program as a first step towards meeting the UK's commitments under several multilateral environmental agreements.","0008-6452

During the XIXth century, Trevor Wollaston extensively sampled the Madeiran islands, compiling a list of almost 700 beetle species, many of them new to science and described by him (e.g., Wollaston 1854, 1865). Thus, for many decades it was thought that the inventory of Madeiran beetle diversity was complete (Machado 2006, but see Lobo & Borges 2010). However, particularly in recent decades, a number of beetle species (most of them of small size and from groups taxonomically more difficult) have been described (see a complete list in Borges et al. 2008b) and important taxonomic revisions have also been made incorporating critical analysis by taxonomic experts. For these reasons, it was as a surprise to find a medium-size and yet undescribed ground beetle species following an extensive survey of epigean arthropods occurring in Madeiran laurel forest fragments. The new species was described in a generic revision of Madeiran Orthomus Chaudoir, 1838 submitted to Zootaxa (Serrano et al. 2009) and the species was included in the comprehensive list of Madeiran terrestrial biodiversity (Borges et al. 2008a), a reference publication on Madeiran fauna and flora published in May 2008. This book also presented a chapter where the distribution of the new species was modelled using predictive distribution models (Jiménez-Valverde et al. 2008).","1175-5326

",,,,"The nutrient-poor soils of Antarctica are sensitive to change. Recent increases in the number of anthropogenic introductions mean that understanding the impact of non-native species on Antarctic soils is pertinent, and essential for developing future risk assessments and management strategies. Through comparative baseline assessments of vegetation, microbes, soil chemistry, substrate composition and micro-arthropod abundance, this study explored if there are detectable terrestrial ecosystem impacts resulting from the introduction of the chironomid midge Eretmoptera murphyi to Signy Island in maritime Antarctica. The key finding was that E. murphyi is the likely driver of an increase in inorganic nitrogen availability within the nutrient-poor soils in which it occurs. When compared with the levels of inorganic nitrogen present in soils influenced by native vertebrate wildlife aggregations, the increase in local nitrate availability associated with E. murphyi was similar to that caused by deposits from seals and giant petrel colonies. Overall, available nitrate has increased by three-to five-fold in soils colonised by the midge, relative to undisturbed soils. This may ultimately impact rates of decomposition as well as the native plant and micro-arthropod communities of Signy Island.

",,,,,,"The energetics of 79 species of birds living in greater New Guinea, data for 44 of which are presented here for the first time, is examined to determine the extent to which it reflects the behavior of species and the conditions they encounter in the environment. Body mass alone accounts for 86.6% of the variation in the basal rate of metabolism of these species, whereas the combination of body mass, foraging sub- strate, flightless condition, activity, and life on islands or continents collectively account for 95.2% of its variation. When the passerine/non-passerine dichotomy is added to the analysis, the six factors account for 96.7% of the variation in basal rate. Basal rate also correlates with other factors, including maximal altitude of distribution, torpor, and food habits when individually combined with body mass, but they lose significance when other factors are brought into the analysis. Altitudinal limits to distribution can be included in the analysis only if activity is dropped because of the correlation between these factors. Torpor correlates with an aerial feeding strategy. Food habits correlated with activity level and the passerine/non-passerine dichotomy. The attempt to account for the variation in the energetics of birds by a phylogenetic analysis is inappropriate because the fundamental basis of energetics is physiological with strong behavioral and ecological overtones. Body mass accounts for 90.4% of the variation in thermal conductance. The regulated level of body temperature varies from ca. 39 to 41°C at masses &gt; 100 g, below which it decreases to 37 and 39°C at 10 g, with a few small species having body temperatures as low as 35°C. New Guinea is an important source for the terrestrial avifauna of South Pacific islands. The characteristics of its birds therefore are appropriate standards by which to judge the adjustments occurring in, and required of, birds endemic to these islands.

",,,,"While Isla Chañaral (29°02’S) in Chile has long been recognized as one of the most important breeding islands for the Humboldt Penguin, the reported numbers of birds there never exceeded 3,500 breeding individuals in the last two decades. However, in 2002, a one-day survey found considerably more penguins present on Isla Chañaral, which exceed the world population estimate for the species (3,300-12,000 birds). Between 9 and 14 February 2003 we conducted a census of the Humboldt Penguin on Isla Chañaral. Two different survey methods were combined to assess the number of penguins. Terrestrial or surface counts were used to survey penguins on open plains or beaches. Small area surveys of randomly established quadrats were conducted to assess the density of penguins in nests and the total number of nest sites. Results from small area surveys were extrapolated using surface size ratios of counting quadrats vs. entire nesting sectors. We determined that approximately 22,000 adult Humboldt Penguins, 3,600 chicks and 117 juveniles were present on the island during the survey. The results were much higher than any previously published estimate. Natural processes alone cannot account for an increase, and penguin numbers on Isla Chañaral previously have been underestimated. The results correspond well with recent publications that suggest that Humboldt Penguin numbers in Chile have been underestimated in the past due to inappropriate or inconsistent census methods. There are concerns about the current protection status of the island in light of its fragility and importance as the premier breeding location of the Humboldt Penguin along its entire distributional range.","1524-4695

Six genera are now recognized in this region, mainly classified by the traditional characters of shell morphology, especially the configuration of the apertural dentition and eccentric shell shape. More recently, genital characters have been used to reveal new species and genera. However, the monophyly of genera and the relationships among different genera and species have not yet been determined. In this regard, we constructed a molecular phylogeny of 89 streptaxid specimens from Thailand, Malaysia and Laos, representing 36 morphospecies in six genera using the COI and 16S rRNA mitochondrial DNA genes. Our findings revealed at least 10 clades with distinct geographic distributions. These clades were both concordant and discordant with traditional classification based on shell morphology. Both Discartemon and Perrottetia are monophyletic with strong statistical support, and congruent with the morphological classification. However, Carinartemis was retrieved as paraphyletic, and Haploptychius and Oophana were retrieved as polyphyletic. Within the genus Discartemon, the D. roebeleni species group shows differentiation between the mainland peninsula and the islands in Southern Thailand. This study is the first evolutionary hypothesis from molecular evidence helping us to assess the status of Thai streptaxid genera, revealing high species diversity amongst the Thai taxa and further complementing our understanding of the biogeographic relationships among different lineages.","1477-2000

",,,,"The papers published in this issue of Biology and Environment are derived from keynote presen tationsmade during the 5th Flora and Fauna of Atlantic Islands symposium held in University College Dublin from the 24th to the 27th August 2004. One hundred delegates encompassing twenty nationalities and sixteen islandnations attended this symposium with presentations based on research on islands from as far apart as Svalbard, within the Arctic Circle to thenorth and the Falkland Islands, close to theArctic Circle in the south.This seriesof symposia developed from the recognition by researchers on Macronesian Islands of the need to understand and preserve the unique ecosystems associated with many isolatedAtlantic islands.The previous four symposiawere held inMadeira, the Canary Islands, theAzores and Cape Verde. The fifthsymposium (FFAIS-5) was thefirstto be held on an Atlantic island outside the four Macronesian archipelagos, and one aim of FFAIS-5 was to foster a greater exchange of findingsfrom a broader range ofAtlantic Islands and countries. One of the arguments for a broad focus on islands and island ecosystems is that common factors thatmay be independent of geographical con siderations are likely to have shaped many of the features of island flora and fauna, isolation being one of the primary factors. However, even closely associated islands can have a strikinglydifferent biota, as the classic example ofDarwin's finches on theGalapagos Island's has so clearly demonstrated. The uniqueness of island ecosystems is likely to be due to a hotch potch of features, where closeness to the mainland is important, as are historically related factors and the extent of human interference. As a consequence of their isolation, islands have provided, and will continue to provide, important information on evolutionary processes, genetic differentiation, adaptation and biodiversity. However, the impact of change on islands may be subtly distinct from the same forces operating on larger land masses. While island ecosystems and biota are very attractive for tourism (ecotourism), they are often vulnerable and theirexploitation for educational or financial reasons requires closer consideration of the environmental impact of any such developments. Invasions by animals and plants have clearly had a major impact on island biodiversity, and with increased trade and greater accessibility this situation is likely to worsen. Of importance is the implementation of the appropriate legislation and the political will to ensure that these issues?issues that pay little heed to geopolitical borders?are dealt with adequately. In the accompanying articles a number of these issues are addressed, covering marine, terrestrial and freshwater environments associated with Atlantic Islands. In two introductoryaccounts,Alan Craig and John Faulkner outline the policies and achieve ments associated with cross-border biodiversity issues in Ireland, recognising the importance of an all-island approach. Eric Hoyt discusses aspects of ecotourism as it relates to whale watching and argues for the creation of speciallyprotectedmarine areas as a way of ensuring the protection of organisms from the major impacts of tourist activities. Some of the intriguing aspects of island ecosystems in the arctic are covered by Ingibjorg Jonsdottir, while the significance of a strongly oceanic climate on plant distribution isdiscussed by Bob Crawford. Classic studies of plant speciation on islands and their significance for adaptation is a theme covered by Richard Abbot. While the importance of appropriate legislation is emphasised in relation to the application of the EU Water Framework Directive to Atlantic islands by Samantha Hughes, legislation alone is unlikely towork in controlling the introduction of invasive plants. Max Wade argues that more consideration should be given to the identification and monitoring of likely invaders. Papers submitted from the general scientific sessions of FFAIS-5, togetherwith abstractsof the keynote presentations, are published as an Occa sional Publication of the Irish Biogeographical Society. And what of the future for islands ecosystems and biota? Like mainland areas, islands face increasing pressures associated with climate/ environmental change.

",,,,"Genetic studies of amphibians frequently reveal substantial population structure often attributed to historical demographic processes from changing climate and isolation due to imposing geographic features. The Western Red-backed Salamander, Plethodon vehiculum (Caudata: Plethodontidae), is the most widespread and abundant terrestrial salamander in the Pacific Northwest. Using mitochondrial DNA sequence data, we addressed questions regarding the phylogeography of P. vehiculum, testing for the presence of Pleistocene refugia and major rivers as barriers to dispersal. Two major clades were recovered using phylogenetic analyses, a southern clade in the Klamath-Siskiyou region and a northern clade ranging from northern Oregon to southern British Columbia. Moderate levels of divergence between the northern and southern clades were observed, warranting further investigation. The northern populations were not highly differentiated from one another. Genetic data presents 2 possibilities, that of a large recent range expansion after the Pleistocene, or possible high habitat connectivity for these salamanders. While the Columbia River does not appear to have been a barrier to dispersal, populations from Vancouver Island and Washington's Olympic Peninsula contain unique haplotypes, as well as relatively higher levels of genetic differentiation compared to other northern populations. The Olympic Peninsula populations also have lower levels of genetic diversity than any other populations throughout the range. Therefore, P. vehiculum shows parallel and dissimilar patterns relating to its historical distribution and genetic population structure compared to other Pacific Northwest fauna.","1051-1733

The increasing anthropogenic pressure on the Antarctic pronounce the significance of long-term monitoring programs for the assessment of the status of local ecosystems. The study area Fildes Region in the southwest of King George Island (South Shetland Islands) includes the Fildes Peninsula, Ardley Island and several islands off the coast. It is one of the largest ice-free areas in the Maritime Antarctic and it is characterized by a relatively high biodiversity, which is subject to the strong climatic changes at the Antarctic Peninsula. Thus, the monitoring of the local bird and seal populations initiated in the 1980s was continued during the summer months (December - February) of the seasons 2015/16 to 2017/18. Furthermore, data from various unpublished expedition reports of German scientists from the 1980s and all available literature were compiled, analyzed and presented in this research report. So, a very divergent population development of the different bird species in the Fildes Region becomes apparent. While some species show an increasing or stable long-term trend (brown skua, gentoo penguin, southern giant petrel), others reveal significant interannual variations of their breeding pair numbers (south polar skua, kelp gull). Other species show a strong decreasing population trend (Adélie and chinstrap penguin, cape petrel). Additionally, a survey of breeding birds in all major ice-free areas of the adjacent Maxwell Bay was conducted. Besides, the documentation of glacier retreat zones of selected areas in the Maxwell Bay in regard of the regional climatic development was continued. On the basis of a repeated mapping of the distribution of the Antarctic hair grass, the expansion of this native grass species was surveyed.

Previous investigations using mtDNA sequences found virtually no genetic differentiation across its distribution range, despite some major biogeographical barriers for terrestrial and freshwater biota. Thus, the absence of any phylogeographical differentiation would be unexpected. To re-examine genetic differentiation within M. rivulata, here we use a comprehensive rangewide sampling and information of 13 unlinked polymorphic microsatellite loci and compare these data against mtDNA variation. Our microsatellite analyses reveal a weak population structuring which conflicts, however, with most biogeographical barriers. We conclude that the genetic structure in the vast majority of the species' range has been shaped by massive transoceanic gene flow. This explanation is unlikely for the northernmost populations, which seem rather to be genetically impacted by intentionally released foreign turtles.","0300-3256

",,,,"The Laysan teal (Anas laysanensis) is an endangered dabbling duck endemic to the Hawaiian Archipelago but currently restricted to a single breeding population on Laysan Island. We studied its diet using fecal analysis and behavioral observations. Laysan teal fecal samples (N=118) contained prey items in 15 primary prey categories with a mean of 2.9 (range 0-7) taxa per sample. Sixty-two of these fecal samples were quantified with 2,270 prey items identified (mean items per sample 37; range 0-205). Based on fecal analysis and behavioral observations, we learned that the Laysan teal is not strictly a macroinsectivore as previously reported, but consumed seeds, succulent leaves, and algae, in addition to adult and larval diptera, ants, lepidoptera, coleoptera, and Artemia. We compared abundance of invertebrates from two terrestrial foraging substrates, soil and standing vegetation, to the abundance of invertebrate prey items counted in fecal samples collected from these habitats for the same period. In the soil substrate, Laysan teal selected two of the most abundant invertebrates, lepidoptera larvae and coleoptera. In the standing vegetation, Laysan teal selected the most abundant taxa: coleoptera. Amphipods were consumed in proportion to their abundance, and small gastropods (Tornatellides sp.), isopods, and arachnids were avoided or were identified in fecal matter in disproportion to their abundance in the foraging habitat. We compared fecal composition of samples collected in aquatic and terrestrial habitats and detected significant differences in samples' species compositions. The conservation implications of the adult Laysan teal's diet are positive, since results indicate that the Laysan teal are opportunistic insectivores, and exhibit dietary flexibility that includes seeds and other food. Dietary flexibility improves the possibility of successfully reestablishing populations on other predator-free islands.","0077-5630

",,,,"Land surface phenology (LSP), the study of phenological patterns of vegetation using vegetation index (VI) time-series derived from multi-spectral satellite imagery, has helped to improve the understanding of the seasonal dynamics of terrestrial ecosystems from local to global scale. High spatial resolution satellite observations have emerged as a new possibility for monitoring the seasonal dynamics of heterogeneous ecosystems. Under-studied Macaronesian ecosystems have specific characteristics that make LSP estimation a complex task (e. g., frequent cloud cover, frequent presence of atmospheric aerosols, different degrees of vegetation density, diversity of plant species, landscape heterogeneity). Thus, this study aims to analyse the potential of LSP based on Sentinel-2 data to monitor the phenological dynamics of vegetation in the Macaronesian ecosystems of Canary Islands (Spain). NDVI time-series were generated using Sentinel-2 data from January 2018 to December 2021. NDVI time-series were smoothed using double logistic function. Three phenometrics, such as the start of the growing season (SOS), the end of the growing season (EOS) and the length of the growing season (LOS), were extracted using a threshold-based method (20%) only for pixels where the mean NDVI value of the smoothed four-year time-series was higher than 0.2. Growing season of the major of Macaronesian vegetation started between late summer and late autumn (start of the wet season) and ended between early spring and early summer (end of the wet season). The most representative Macaronesian tree species had a clear and marked seasonality, except for the laurel forest species. SOS of Juniperus phoenicea subsp. turbinata was slightly later than for Olea europaea var. sylvestris and Pinus canariensis, while the mean EOS was slightly later for Olea europaea var. sylvestris. The intra-specific variability of SOS and EOS in the laurel forests was very high. LSP derived from Sentinel-2 data contributed to understand the seasonal dynamics of the main Macaronesian ecosystems. However, the heterogeneity of laurel forests made it difficult the LSP estimation in laurel forests. Thus, complementary phenological approaches are suggested to improve the knowledge of the seasonal dynamics of this Macaronesian ecosystem.

For the same characteristics, they are also extremely vulnerable to human-mediated disturbances. During the last centuries, nearly 80% of species extinctions have occurred on islands. While there is information on the human threats, level of protection, and conservation importance of islands, an integrative picture combining these aspects and aimed at determining conservation priorities to inform decision-making is still missing. Here, we jointly analyzed these three aspects producing a worldwide island conservation assessment based on terrestrial vertebrates. Considering the Aichi target of >17% of protection and all protected area categories, we found that 5397 islands, encompassing a quarter of the worldwide island area, face high human modification and have a low level of protection, with 33% of them showing extreme levels of human modification. Also, if we were to consider the new threshold of protected area coverage proposed to accurately protect the world’s biodiversity and ecosystems (Nature Needs Half initiative), 77% of the world’s islands would face this dramatic scenario. Furthermore, most large islands harboring the highest number of threatened vertebrates are found on this critical situation (low protection and high human modification). Based on the analysis of these conservation scenarios, we identified potential priority islands that provide opportunities to improve island conservation worldwide. The mbest opportunities are located in 58 islands with a low level of protection and human modification, which harbor more than 5 threatened vertebrates’ species and are located in different regions of the world.

The La Meseta Formation fills an incised valley and comprises sediments that represent deltaic, estuarine and very shallow marine environments. Forests of both deciduous and evergreen trees were dominated by Nothofagus, podocarps, and araucarian conifers. The La Meseta paleoflora is distinctive in having a predominance of Antarctic taxa; this suggests a seasonal, cold-temperate, rainy climate and a latitudinal gradient. Among the terrestrial vertebrates, there are at least nine mammal taxa, predominantly tiny marsupials (mostly endemic and new genera). The presence of these marsupials suggests the existence of some form of isolating barrier (climatic and/or geographic), which must have allowed development of this endemic fauna. Comparisons with faunas assigned to the Itaboraian (late Paleocene), Riochican (late Paleocene), Casamayoran (early Eocene), and Mustersan (tentatively assigned to the middle Eocene) ages of Patagonia were made. The assemblage of terrestrial vertebrates of the La Meseta Formation is unusual in the dominance of several endemic forms. The occurrence of protodidelphid and derorhynine marsupials, that had become extinct elsewhere in the Eocene of South America, on Seymour Island also indicates that isolation may have allowed extended survival of these taxa in the Eocene of Antarctica. The nature, distribution, and composition of the La Meseta fauna firmly suggest a latitudinal differentiation in the middle Eocene.

",,"Wiley
",,,,"Abstract Climate change is increasing the frequency, intensity, and duration of extreme weather events across the globe. Understanding the capacity for ecological communities to withstand and recover from such events is critical. Typhoons are extreme weather events that are expected to broadly homogenize ecological dynamics through structural damage to vegetation and longer‐term effects of salinization. Given their unpredictable nature, monitoring ecological responses to typhoons is challenging, particularly for mobile animals such as birds. Here, we report spatially variable ecological responses to typhoons across terrestrial landscapes. Using a high temporal resolution passive acoustic monitoring network across 24 sites on the subtropical island of Okinawa, Japan, we found that typhoons elicit divergent ecological responses among Okinawa's diverse terrestrial habitats, as indicated by increased spatial variability of biological sound production (biophony) and individual species detections. This suggests that soniferous communities are capable of a diversity of different responses to typhoons. That is, spatial insurance effects among local ecological communities provide resilience to typhoons at the landscape scale. Even though site‐level typhoon impacts on soundscapes and bird detections were not particularly strong, monitoring at scale with high temporal resolution across a broad spatial extent nevertheless enabled detection of spatial heterogeneity in typhoon responses. Further, species‐level responses mirrored those of acoustic indices, underscoring the utility of such indices for revealing insight into fundamental questions concerning disturbance and stability. Our findings demonstrate the significant potential of landscape‐scale acoustic sensor networks to capture the understudied ecological impacts of unpredictable extreme weather events.

",,,,"Often, ecological details are ignored in biogeographical analyses. I use the orchid flora of the Samoan islands to investigate the importance of such details for explaining biogeographical patterns, with special attention to habitat availability and long distance dispersal. Using data on orchid occurrence, island properties, and species traits, I examine putative ecological drivers of species distribution including many that are seldom considered in island biogeography. Simulations show that communities on younger islands are nested subsets of those on older ones. Epiphytic orchids, but not terrestrial orchids, are nested by altitude. Percent endemism is positively correlated with island age in a simple linear regression and positively correlated with altitude in a multiple linear regression that also included distance from the nearest island. ANOVA shows that orchids with high minimum elevations tend to be restricted to one or two islands, whereas widespread orchids tend to have low elevation requirements. These findings suggest that species traits, abiotic environment, cladogenesis, and/or repeated long-distance dispersal affect species distributions. More specifically, altitudinal habitat availability strongly affects orchid occurrence on any given Samoan island.

",,"Wiley
",,,,"Summary Stable isotope analysis is a powerful method for estimating the impacts animals have on their environment (resource use), revealing their ecological niches. We demonstrated the use of a stable isotope mixing model for measuring the ecological niches of consumers. In particular, we used the model IsotopeR to estimate the resource use of two species with complex, omnivorous diets: invasive Norway rats from the Aleutian Islands, AK , and American black bears from Yosemite National Park, CA . Marginal posterior distributions for major food sources (for populations, groups and individuals) described the resource axes that partly define the realized niches of these omnivores. We used measures of these resource axes to inform resource management in the Aleutians and Yosemite. Results from our analyses confirm that coastal rats did not rely on marine birds on rat‐infested islands in the Aleutians. Instead, rats foraged primarily on terrestrial plants and preferred amphipods when they were available. We also use stable isotopes to confirm that plants and acorns are the largest contributors to black bear nutrition in Yosemite and learned that female bears foraged for acorns and pine nuts more heavily than males. Although it is unclear if Norway rats can maintain viable populations in the Aleutians without access to marine‐derived animal protein, results from our analyses suggest their dependence on such nutrients. In addition, sex‐specific differences in foraging for high‐fat acorns and pine nuts in Yosemite suggest black bear populations in the Sierra Nevada may be limited by the productivity and health of hard mast species. As demonstrated here, stable isotope analysis has wide applicability for investigating the resource use and ecological niches of animals.

",,,,"Many scientists argue that our planet is undergoing a mass extinction event that is largely due to human influences. In this context, rediscoveries of species presumed to be extinct are encouraging and of great potential interest. During a 2003 expedition to New Caledonia, Bocourt’s terrific skink, Phoboscincus bocourti, was unexpectedly rediscovered on a small islet by one of us. This skink species had been described from a single specimen collected around 1872 in New Caledonia. Since that time, however, no data on the species’ biology, trophic interactions, or role in the ecosystem have been collected, making it difficult to follow the established conservation plan. In this study, we used a multidisciplinary approach involving natural history, anatomy, morphology, genetics, and stable isotopes to elucidate the ecology of Bocourt’s terrific skink. Over the course of three different expeditions to the islet (total of 55 days across 2005 and 2012), we captured 4 individuals and observed another 4 individuals. The species’ dentition and trophic ecology suggest that it is a top predator in its ecosystem and a major consumer of small terrestrial reptiles. Its high degree of genetic relatedness to another New Caledonian skink, which has a broad distribution, suggests that P. bocourti underwent genetic isolation at a geographical remote location, where dispersal or colonization was highly improbable. Moreover, the lack of genetic variation among the four individuals we captured may imply that a unique lineage, characterized by few inter-island exchanges, exists on the islet. Bocourt’s terrific skink may be the largest terrestrial squamate predator alive in New Caledonia today. As a result, it is likely vulnerable to habitat modifications and especially the invasive rodents found on this islet. Further information is necessary to assess the conservation plans and practices in place as no concrete changes have been made since the species’ rediscovery almost 10 years ago.

",,,,"The recently described green algal genus Pseudorhizoclonium was erected for Rhizoclonium-like specimens that resolved as a separate clade from Rhizoclonium sensu stricto based on nuclear ribosomal DNA (SSU and LSU) data. We analysed 36 collections of Pseudorhizoclonium, including 18 new specimens, which resulted in a considerably extended distribution range that is mostly tropical to subtropical and includes Brazil, Madagascar, Philippines, French Polynesia, Panama, Tanzania, the Federated States of Micronesia, the Hawaiian Islands, Lord Howe Island (Australia) and temperate New Zealand. Ten distinct clades were resolved in phylogenetic analyses based on a combined SSU + LSU dataset, five of which were previously named as either Pseudorhizoclonium or Rhizoclonium species, and five of which likely represent novel lineages for this genus and are here named as new species (P. australe Boedeker, Leliaert & A.R.Sherwood, P. hawaiiense A.R.Sherwood, Boedeker & Leliaert, P. mangroviorum Boedeker, Leliaert & A.R.Sherwood, P. philippinense Leliaert, Boedeker & A.R.Sherwood, and P. subaerophilum A.R.Sherwood, Boedeker & Leliaert). Analysis of morphological characters demonstrated that although there was substantial overlap in character range for some lineages, others were distinct for one or more characters; however, morphological identification of the lineages is unreliable. The range of habitats in which these specimens were collected has been extended to include truly terrestrial areas and freshwater streams, which expands the known habitats of this genus beyond the original reports of mangroves, lagoons, and high intertidal areas. This genus represents an independent case of transition from marine into freshwater and terrestrial environments in the Cladophorales. Pseudorhizoclonium appears to have an unusually high tolerance for fluctuating environmental conditions, which may be related to the remarkable number of habitat transitions that have occurred within the genus.

","Sedgeley, Jane",,Full moon; Home range,,,2001.0,,,179,195,,,,,,3,2,,,,,,,"This study assesses the extent of midwinter activity (June-July, 1996, 1998) in an island population of lesser short-tailed bat (Mystacina tuberculata) located at the southern limit (= highest latitude) of the species' distribution. Activity of radio-tagged bats (n = 22 bats) was monitored over 38 nights (years combined). A mean ± SE of 64.1 ± 6.5% (range = 0-100%) of radio-tagged bats flew on each night monitored when mean minimum temperature was 3.4 ± 0.5°C. Temperatures ranged from -1.0 to 8.9°C, and 33% of tagged bats flew on the coldest night. Video-monitoring revealed high levels of activity at 11 large communally occupied tree roosts on 100% of nights monitored (n = 31 nights, years combined). Mean minimum temperatures on these nights was 3.0°C ± 0.5 (range = -1.4-7.1). Periods of activity were associated with feeding, social displays and changing roost sites. Movements of bats were dynamic with large numbers emerging from and entering roosts, often simultaneously, throughout most of the night (x = 81.9 ± 3.3% of night). Maximum numbers of active bats in tree cavities at one time numbered > 100 individuals on 75% of nights monitored. These included nine nights when individuals numbered > 500, and five nights when individuals numbered > 1,000 (maximum = 1, 443). Radio-tagged bats spent 57.1 ± 9.7% of time monitored roosting alone and the remainder roosting communally. They changed roost site on average every 4.2 ± 0.8 days moving between a total of 35 different roosts. Roosts were often re-used either by the same individual or by several different bats. Most radio-tagged bats visited communal night roosts that were different from those they had used during the day, with up to eight radio-tagged individuals visiting simultaneously. Lower levels of activity were recorded at six roosts that were occupied on the same nights as large active communal roosts. Video-monitoring over a total of 31 nights revealed external activity at these roosts on only 11 nights (35.4%). One radio-tagged bat did not emerge for 13 days. I suggest that winter activity may not be as energetically expensive for M. tuberculata as for many other cold-temperate bat species. Their ability to forage on terrestrial invertebrates, which are not commonly available to other species, and to select different roost sites where they could either remain active or relatively inactive, may allow them to be active more frequently and for longer durations.

",,,,"Antarctica and the sub-Antarctic islands include some of the world's most extreme and pristine terrestrial habitats. While they are characterized by low biodiversity and terrestrial communities that are comprised of small, often microscopic, noncharismatic species, they have become a focus of studies of adaptation and biological function in the face of multiple extreme environmental stresses (Convey & Biersma, 2023). Furthermore, they are highly sensitive to climate change and are considered natural laboratories to study and understand its impacts on biota (Contador et al., 2015; Convey & Peck, 2019). In the second half of the 20th century, the maritime Antarctic experienced considerable warming (Turner et al., 2014), causing deglaciation and the development of new ice-free areas and freshwater habitats, both along the coast and inland (Nędzarek & Pociecha, 2010), a process that is expected to continue (Lee et al., 2017). While the regional warming trends paused in the early 21st century (Turner et al., 2016), they are predicted to resume through the rest of the century (Bracegirdle et al., 2020), and a recent botanical study from Signy Island (South Orkney Islands) suggests this may already be happening (Cannone et al., 2022). Maritime Antarctic lakes can experience extremely rapid physical ecosystem change, even magnifying the very rapid (in global terms) regional air temperature increases (of up to 2°C in mean annual air temperature) (Quayle et al., 2002, 2003). The lakes, streams and terrestrial habitats that make up Antarctica's land-based ecosystems are generally oligotrophic, small, and isolated. Many of their small invertebrates, lichens and microbes are found nowhere else on Earth (Convey et al., 2020; Convey & Biersma, 2023; Vincent & Laybourn-Parry, 2008). Other than the scavenging snowy sheathbill (Chionis albus), closely associated with marine vertebrate aggregations, the Antarctic terrestrial fauna consists only of small invertebrates, with just two native species of holometabolous insects, Parochlus steinenii Gercke, 1889 and Belgica antarctica Jacobs, 1900 (Diptera: Chironomidae), and two established nonnative species, Eretmoptera murphyi Schäffer, 1914 (Chironomidae) and Trichocera maculipennis Meigen, 1818 (Trichoceridae) (Convey & Block, 1996; Kozeretska et al., 2021; Potocka & Krzemińska, 2018; Volonterio et al., 2013). Of these, the terrestrial B. antarctica is strictly endemic to coastal regions of the western Antarctic Peninsula and the South Shetland Islands. In contrast, P. steinenii is not found on the Antarctic Peninsula, but occurs throughout the South Shetland Islands in the maritime Antarctic, sub-Antarctic South Georgia and the sub-Antarctic Magellanic ecoregion of southern South America (Contador et al., 2020; Gañan et al., 2021). Its larvae and pupae are aquatic, inhabiting lakes and streams, while the winged adults are terrestrial (Figure 1). As parts of Antarctica undergo some of the most rapid changes worldwide in air temperature, glacial cover, and lake seasonality, polar flies face extreme changes in their environments. Insect life histories are influenced by changing temperatures, from physiology through development and voltinism (number of generations per year) to population dynamics and range (Contador et al., 2014). Climate change has significantly influenced the phenological patterns, distribution, and physiological adaptations of multiple species in different parts of the planet. Those distributed in alpine, subpolar, and polar regions are particularly affected (Walther et al., 2002). Studies of the life history, phenology, and stress tolerances of insects inhabiting aquatic ecosystems in these regions are critical for a better understanding of the ecological consequences of recent and ongoing climate change. Antarctica's native and often endemic terrestrial invertebrate species appear particularly flexible in terms of their life history and ecophysiological strategies (Convey, 1996; Convey & Block, 1996). For example, recent studies have shown that P. steinenii has a wide thermal tolerance, ranging from −5 to +31°C (Contador et al., 2020; Pertierra et al., 2021), which could be an evolutionary consequence of the considerable magnitude of both short- and long-term variation in microenvironmental conditions within their habitats. However, while B. antarctica has been extensively studied as a model organism for a better understanding of the adaptations to extreme environments (Kozeretska et al., 2021), there has been much less research focused on P. steinenii, although studies of its phylogeny, physiology, and distribution patterns have increased in recent years (Allegrucci et al., 2006; Contador et al., 2020; Gañan et al., 2021; Pertierra et al., 2021). These species are of particular interest in terms of their ability to adapt and respond to changing environmental conditions, potentially being sentinel species of the ecosystem consequences of human-induced global environmental change (Kozeretska et al., 2021). In this context, we characterized the habitat preferences, life cycle, and phenology of P. steinenii, the winged Antarctic midge, to better understand how climate change may affect the phenological patterns of this species through time and space. We studied the habitat preferences and the life history of P. steinenii in Lake Kitiesh, Fildes Peninsula, King George Island (62° S, Maritime Antarctica; Figure 1D) over the austral summer seasons from 2014 to 2019, during short (several weeks) field expeditions organized by the Chilean Antarctic Institute (INACH); longer duration, including year-round, field sampling is not possible at this location due to logistic limitations, as is commonly the case in Antarctic field research. This lake hosts an abundant population of P. steinenii and is easily accessible from Professor Julio Escudero Station (INACH, Chile), allowing for continuous site monitoring during the expeditions and the deployment of year-round environmental monitoring equipment. Ice-free areas on King George Island include many temporary shallow meltwater ponds and permanent lakes (typically smaller than 100 m2), which are generally ice covered for the majority of the year (Kim et al., 2020). Surrounding ice-free terrestrial habitats in their catchments are characterized by rich herb–moss communities including the Antarctic hairgrass Deschampsia antarctica and a diverse moss and lichen community. Antarctic populations of P. steinenii are restricted to permanent deeper lakes, which are ice covered for 9–10 months each year, and are surrounded by ice-free areas (Contador et al., 2020; Hahn & Reinhardt, 2006). To characterize the terrestrial habitat in which adults are found, we established five line transects around the perimeter of Lake Kitiesh (Figure 1D). Two transects were located parallel to the main inflow and outflow streams, while the other three were oriented approximately in N, NE and S directions, in each case perpendicular to the lake and starting at the lake edge. Along each transect, we quantified adult densities using 50 × 50 cm quadrats (subdivided into 10 × 10 cm grids) at 0, 2, 4, and 6 m from the lake shore. Adults of P. steinenii were not observed beyond 6 m from the lake edge. Numbers of adult flies in each 10 × 10 cm grid were recorded, and a digital photograph of each entire quadrat was taken to allow assessment of habitat preferences (Canon PowerShot D20). We recorded rock, snow, mud, moss, and water proportions within each quadrat. We assessed differences in P. steinenii adult density around the lake shore using permutational multivariate analysis of variance (PERMANOVA), based on a Bray–Curtis similarity matrix. We also investigated the relationship between P. steinenii density (individuals/m2) and habitat type (rock, snow, mud, moss, and water) using distance-based linear models (DistLM). Both analyses were run in PRIMER-E v7 with Permanova+add-on (Anderson, 2005). The data obtained indicated that P. steinenii adults aggregated at the lake edge, where they reproduce during the austral summer, the females laying batches of eggs at the bases of rocks and stones at the shoreline (Hahn & Reinhardt, 2006). Densities were significantly different at 0, 2, 4, and 6 m distance from the lake shore (p = 0.001, 999 unique permutations, PERMANOVA), being greatest at the shoreline, where they averaged 200 individuals/m2 and reached a maximum of 500 individuals/m2. Density decreased significantly as little as 2 m from the shoreline (mean 35 individuals/m2), and further to 17 individuals/m2 at 4 and 6 m from the shoreline. To visualize densities and habitat preferences, a nonmetric multidimensional scaling analysis (nMDS) was performed, and the habitats assessed were overlaid in the nMDS as vectors (Pearson correlations) (Figure 2C). This indicated that adult flies preferred large rocks adjacent to the shoreline, particularly those oriented to protect them from exposure to wind and snow. Adults were also associated with moss patches, mainly at 2 and 4 m from the shoreline, and were rarely associated with mud (DistLM, R2 = 0.44). To assess the thermal characteristics of the aquatic environment in which P. steinenii develops from egg to adult, we anchored one temperature data logger (HOBO U22 Water Temp Pro V2) at a depth of 50 cm in Lake Kitiesh, corresponding to the depth at which high densities of larvae are commonly found during the austral summer. Minimum, maximum, and average daily water temperature (°C) were recorded from January 2014 to January 2019. Using these data, we calculated growing degree days (GDD), using the pollen package in R (Nowosad, 2019; R Core Team., 2021), which calculates GDDs available for development as the accumulated product of time and temperature above 0°C (noting that lake water temperatures are not likely to exceed the upper developmental temperature of P. steinenii, although this has not been formally assessed and that the larvae do not survive freezing) using daily maximum and minimum temperature data (Baskerville & Emin, 1969; Nufio & Buckley, 2019). To describe the life cycle of P. steinenii, we collected reproductive adults (n = 200) from rocks along the lake shore. Small rearing chambers (10 containers of 250 ml) were set up under controlled temperature conditions (4°C) in the laboratory of Professor Escudero Station as described by Harada et al. (2014). Each rearing chamber contained lake sediment, rocks, and water from the midge's habitat. Groups of ~20 reproductive adults were placed in each container, where mating occurred followed by oviposition on the surface of the rocks. The egg masses were then transported in the rearing chambers to the Wankara Laboratory (Universidad de Magallanes) in Puerto Williams, Navarino Island, Chile. At the Wankara Laboratory, the chambers were maintained in an incubator with a 16 h light and 8 h dark cycle (LD = 16 h:8 h) at ~4°C (range achieved 4–4.5°C), monitored by a temperature logger (Hobo U22 Water Temp Pro V2) recording from the first day of observation until the hatching of the adults. Weekly observations of larval development were made until they reached the adult stage. Larval instar was assigned based on size, initially by eye and then followed by detailed measurements of head width and length (mm) using a microscope with a built-in camera (Leica DM750), calibrated for each image. Head capsule length (mm) was measured from the anterior margin of the frons to the posterior margin of the head's sclerites, while the width (mm) was measured as the distance across the eyes on the head capsule. This enabled larval development to be followed through four distinct developmental instars (L1, L2, L3, L4) (see Appendix S1). Growing degree days (GDDs, thermal units) needed to complete a cycle from egg to adult were then calculated. We obtained the GDDs required for each developmental stage and compared these with the GDD accumulation curve obtained from the water temperature recorded at 50 cm depth in Lake Kitiesh between 2014 and 2019. In the laboratory, after oviposition, a total of 53 eggs hatched close together after 109 GDDs and the L1 required 326 ± 55 (n = 40) GGDs to reach the next molt, with L2, L3, and L4 requiring ~65 ± 11 (n = 38), 77 ± 8 (n = 34) and 192 ± 31 (n = 32) GDDs, respectively. The pupal stage required 166 ± 38 (n = 29) GDDs, meaning that the overall development from oviposition to adult emergence required 1056 ± 41 (n = 12) GDDs (Figure 2A). Similarly, in a simple preliminary laboratory trial in a varying temperature environment (6–12°C) overall development took ~1210 GDDs. Using the temperature data obtained from the natural lake habitat at 50 cm depth, the accumulation of ~1200 GDDs took 4 years. We therefore hypothesize that P. steinenii requires a multiyear life in this habitat at present. Furthermore, GDDs accumulated rapidly during only a short period in the austral summer (December–April) (Figure 2A) during which, we assumed, most biological activity (i.e., larval growth, pupation, adult hatching) would occur. However, we recognize that the larvae may move between different microhabitats in the lake benthos and thereby experience conditions that differ from those at the 50-cm depth where we obtained our lake temperature data. For instance, as oviposition takes place on rocks at the lake edge, hatching L1 will enter very shallow and likely warmer water before moving to greater depths. Hahn and Reinhardt (2006) noted that, in the very shallow water at the lake edge, larvae may complete the first two instars before experiencing their first winter. However, before winter they need to move to deeper parts of the lake in order to survive (Rauschert, 2008), and where they avoid ice formation which is fatal (Contador et al., 2020; Shimada et al., 1991). The extent to which larvae show coordinated or timed movements to and from deeper or shallower water is yet to be investigated. Thus, the balance between time spent at deeper and colder, and shallower and warmer, depths has the potential to both accelerate or decelerate development relative to the 4 years estimated here, and requires further research. However, the fact that all developmental stages were active together in Lake Kitiesh during the austral summers of our study is consistent with the presence of multiple overlapping generations. We found that P. steinenii can be extremely abundant at the local scale. However, at the same time, it is very restricted in terms of its preferred microhabitat distribution. The adult stage is only found along the edges of Antarctic lakes, using rocks and mosses to protect it from harsh environmental conditions, and often most obvious when forming swarms on the ground (Figure 2B,C). While it is capable of flight, for instance being attracted to lit windows of research stations, in our field observations we did not note that adults were flying, rather they were mainly walking and present in large aggregations at ground level. During more windy conditions, we noted that adults sometimes were transported to areas further than 6 m from the lake shore, but such events occurred infrequently. Even though this fly is winged, such observations have suggested that aerial dispersal is a rare occurrence, which is consistent with the complete lack of records of vagrant individuals from the neighboring northern Antarctic Peninsula, which is only 90 km away and to where prevailing westerly winds might be expected to carry it. Additionally, paleolimnological evidence suggests that the species has not previously occurred in the northeast Antarctic Peninsula (Gibson & Bayly, 2007). Such a lack of aerial dispersal may also indicate that the populations of different lakes and islands in the South Shetland Islands may be more isolated in an evolutionary context than might be expected from their apparent physical proximity. However, while Allegrucci et al. (2006) gave a preliminary estimate that South Shetland Islands populations of the species have been isolated from those in South Georgia and southern South America for ~2 million years or more, ongoing molecular phylogeographic studies have yet to examine the differentiation between populations at finer spatial scales. Given these constraints, we asked three key questions as a basis for future research: (1) How could climate change affect the species' phenological patterns? (2) What is the potential of P. steinenii to be able to move and disperse beyond its current distribution in the maritime Antarctic? and (3) What could the impacts of climate change be on this species, given its highly restricted and specialized microhabitat characteristics? Phenological patterns are changing worldwide due to global environmental change. Many cold environment insect species have long life cycles, resulting from very slow growth, repeated or prolonged periods of dormancy, or very long-lived adults (Danks, 1992). Among the invertebrate fauna, insects are strongly affected by thermal variation, as the thermal environment directly affects their growth rates and maturation, and their ability to survive when temperatures exceed their tolerance range. Accumulating evidence suggests that climate change affects the phenology, population sizes, distribution ranges, development, and activity of insects at all trophic levels, resulting in temporal decoupling that may in turn lead to population crashes or extinctions (Nufio & Buckley, 2019; Parmesan, 2006, 2007). In particular, Arctic Chironomidae often have life cycles extending over several seasons (Hodkinson et al., 1996) and adult emergence is highly synchronous, often triggered by rising temperatures (Butler, 1980). For P. steinenii we observed a synchronous pattern of emergence, extending through the austral summer (Figure 2A). Synchronous emergence appears to be an important adaptation to the harsh environmental conditions in Antarctic Chironomidae, as it is in Arctic insects. In this context, the physiological mechanisms for synchronization must be particularly effective, as cohorts may develop over several years allowing the opportunity to diverge in growth and development (Butler, 1980). The possession of an obligate diapause, particularly in the pupal stage, presents one mechanism by which emergence synchrony may be restored. However, the presence of diapause does not appear to have been specifically investigated in this species. Our own preliminary laboratory observations in a simple and thermally variable culture experiment did not suggest the presence of obligate developmental arrest in any life stage, but we did not attempt any temperature manipulation to mimic the presence of, for instance, a seasonal cooling cue activating a diapause phase. One of the many species' traits that has been used to link climate change to phenological shifts is the thermal requirement for development, which can be measured using GDD (Cayton et al., 2015). Integrating GDD data into models aimed at forecasting the impact of current climate change provides a powerful tool for assessing its effects on insect phenology, as it can account for both regional and temporal variations in temperature (e.g., Hughes et al., 2013). We established the first long-term study to improve our understanding of the ecology and life history of P. steinenii. It is already known that freshwater ecosystems in the maritime Antarctic may be strongly affected by climate change (Quayle et al., 2003). Therefore, the voltinism patterns and habitat suitability of P. steinenii could also be severely impacted. Further studies are now required to explore how phenological patterns and voltinism could be affected under different climate change scenarios, using GDDs to predict changes across space and time in the maritime Antarctic. Dispersal is another major life history trait and is particularly important in changing and extreme environments (Lakovic et al., 2017; Waters et al., 2020). We observed that P. steinenii has a very restricted microhabitat distribution, with the apparently rare occurrence of aerial dispersal events. These observations are especially important because migration toward more suitable regions is a common response to climate change (Arenas et al., 2012). Hence, the lack of dispersal capacity in this flying insect may increase its sensitivity to landscape/environmental variation, manifested by a reduced gene flow between even local populations, potentially driving speciation, and increasing susceptibility to extinction. Placed in the context of more general awareness of Antarctic terrestrial diversity as well as the need for its protection, it is notable that most visitors to Antarctica are generally attracted by its charismatic marine fauna (penguins, seals, whales), spectacular scenery, and the all-too-familiar hostility of its environments; they express amazement that the continent's values include terrestrial biodiversity. There is virtually no awareness that Antarctica hosts insects or other terrestrial fauna, such as P. steinenii, or that these provide potentially key sentinels of the consequences of human-induced environmental change. To contribute to the compatibility of the conservation of the populations of this unique Antarctic dipteran in the face of greater intensity of long-term research, we designed nonextractive methods and prioritized ethical considerations in our study. We adapted the biocultural ethics approach to design methods that minimize collection through periods of field observation of behavior and population density (Contador, Rendoll, et al., 2022). Ecosystems and their component biota globally face multiple threats today and, therefore, it is essential to broaden the spectrum of ethical consideration beyond the historical focus on vertebrates (Rozzi, 2019). The conservation of P. steinenii should be motivated both by its intrinsic value as well as its instrumental value as a potentially effective sentinel of climate change in Antarctic terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. The only winged Antarctic midge can alert us about changes in its thermal environment that may have significant impacts on its current habitats and phenological patterns, resulting in important structural changes in ecosystems in Antarctic regions.

",,,,"Angiostrongylus cantonensis is a metastrongyloid nematode and the etiologic agent of angiostrongyliasis, a disease characterized by eosinophilic meningitis. This emerging zoonotic parasite has undergone great expansion, including in some regions of Europe and America. In the Canary Islands, the parasite was first discovered parasitizing Rattus rattus on the island of Tenerife in 2010. To date, the distribution of this parasite in the Canary Islands has been restricted to the northern zone and the main cities of Tenerife. Using molecular tools for the sentinel species present in the Canary Islands, this study confirmed the presence of the nematode on two other islands in the Canary Archipelago: La Gomera and Gran Canaria. Furthermore, this emerging parasite was detected, besides in the common definitive host R. rattus, in wild Mus musculus and Felis catus and in four terrestrial gastropod species, Limacus flavus, Milax gagates, Insulivitrina emmersoni, and Insulivitrina oromii, two of them endemic to La Gomera, for the first time, increasing the number of non-definitive host species. This study reinforces the expansion character of A. cantonensis and highlights the importance of knowledge about sentinel species for identifying new transmission locations that help prevent and control the transmission of the parasite and, thus, prevent public health problems.

","Spurr, E.; Ralph, C.",,Ornithology; Distance sampling,,,2006.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"New Zealand does not have a comprehensive bird-population monitoring scheme (see Spurr 2005),
though it does have some species- or habitat-specific surveys. For example, the Ornithological Society
of New Zealand (OSNZ) undertakes a number of bird population studies including an annual national
wader survey (http://osnz.org.nz/studies.htm). The Department of Conservation (DOC) also
undertakes bird population studies and currently has some 189 ongoing monitoring projects on its
books (T. Greene, DOC, Christchurch, pers. comm.). Other organisations in New Zealand (e.g.
Landcare Research, Royal Forest and Bird Protection Society, Fish and Game New Zealand, and
various territorial local authorities) also undertake bird population monitoring.
A workshop in 2004 recommended the establishment of a nationally coordinated scheme for
monitoring bird populations (Spurr 2005). A small working group, comprising representatives from
OSNZ, DOC, and Landcare Research, was convened to implement this. As a consequence, a
symposium on bird population monitoring was held on 9 December 2005, as part of the Australasian
Ornithological Conference, St Mary’s Parish Centre, Blenheim, New Zealand (http://osnz.org.nz), and
a follow-up workshop on monitoring of terrestrial (land) bird populations was held on 11 December
2005, following the conference.
The primary objective of the workshop was to consider options for the design and implementation of
a terrestrial breeding bird survey for New Zealand. It was assumed that such a survey should be part
of a comprehensive scheme for monitoring bird populations, consisting of a package of different
survey types (e.g. Breeding Bird Survey, Winter Bird Survey, Garden Bird Survey, and Constant
Effort Mist-netting of terrestrial birds, as well as surveys of other species groups such as wetland birds

",,,,"West, R.G. ( 2000 ) Plant Life of Quaternary Cold Stages: Evidence from the British Isles. Pp. xi + 320 . Cambridge University Press , Cambridge . ISBN 0-521-59397-2 . Price £65 (hardback). Includes CD ROM. Professor Richard West has been at the forefront of the development of Quaternary science in the UK for some four decades or so. During this period, he has focused his attention on the investigation of a number of important Pleistocene sections and boreholes located throughout East Anglia and neighbouring districts, initially under the leadership of, but subsequently as successor to, Sir Harry Godwin at the sub-department of Quaternary Research in Cambridge. This work led to a steady stream of meticulous reports on the geology and plant history of the Pleistocene in Britain, with a number of these widely acknowledged to be classic and innovative publications. Indeed, his classification of different temperate stages of the Pleistocene, based on his analyses of pollen assemblage and plant macrofossil data published during the 1950s and 1960s, still underpins the terminology and structure of much of the stratigraphic scheme employed for the Pleistocene in the UK (Jones & Keen 1993; Bowen 1999). In view of his influential role in the development of the subject, his extensive experience of the study of exposed sediment sequences in a wide spectrum of geological contexts, and his insight into the influence of taphonomic factors on the fossil plant record, any new treatise by R.G. West on the interpretation of the Quaternary plant record surely merits close attention. This book presents a synthesis that complements West’s earlier works on the temperate-stage plant record, this time focusing on the accumulated fossil plant record from cold stage deposits in the British Isles. It is the first comprehensive treatment of its subject. West has not only scrutinized the pollen assemblage and plant macrofossil records of cold stage deposits recovered from many sites in the UK, but has also travelled extensively throughout Svalbard, the Canadian Arctic Archipelago, the Yukon, the North-west Territories and arctic Alaska to examine modern plant assemblages, in order to assess their potential as suitable analogues for understanding fossil assemblages. The book has three interwoven strands: an attempt to provide a coherent summary of the large amount of data obtained from cold stage floras from sites in the British Isles; a comprehensive, quantitative archive and classification of these data in the form of an electronic data base; and consideration of some of the general conclusions that can be drawn from this comprehensive record. This review will examine each of these strands in turn. The ‘raw’ data are the published and unpublished plant records (pollen and/or plant macrofossil assemblages) available to West up to the data-entry date of 1995. As a prelude to the interpretation of these data, Chapter 1 introduces the importance of the assembly of such a comprehensive archive. The questions posed, which such an archive can help to address, are rather fundamental ones, about the past distribution and behaviour of plant species, and about the use of the fossil plant record for reconstructing past environments, including climate conditions. Chapter 2 attempts to provide a general geological setting (stratigraphic scheme and definitions, dating of sequences, glacial limits in the British Isles), while Chapter 3 introduces the typical sedimentary environments in which the various fossil records probably accumulated, as well as the range of taphonomic problems with which the Quaternary palaeobotanist has to grapple. I suspect that the three introductory chapters will prove somewhat confusing for readers not familiar with the underlying stratigraphic terminology and concepts. On the other hand, the treatment seems too skeletal for those more expert in the field, who will nod enthusiastically at the mention of various stratigraphic or taphonomic issues, but who, like me, might feel a little frustrated with the relatively limited treatment they receive. However, I do recognize the ‘no-win dilemma’ that West must have faced in trying to satisfy both constituencies. Nevertheless, many readers will surely be discouraged by the use of such terms as ‘palaeolithoclimatic’ and ‘palaeobioclimatic’ in early passages of the book, terms that are likely to be confusing for some, while raising questions in the minds of others about their specific definition and application. The sites from which the records were obtained are introduced in Chapter 5. The geographical bias of the data from the British Isles becomes apparent immediately, with the vast majority of the records from central and eastern England. This mainly reflects the preponderance in these parts of the country of records for intervals that predate the last glacial stage. In other districts, any comparable records that existed in the past have largely been removed by advancing ice sheets, or periglacial or other processes that promoted ground surface instability. However, it also reflects the region of main interest to West. A number of important records have been omitted. For example, there are only three records listed from Scotland (including the Scottish Islands), four from Ireland, one from the south-west counties of England, and none from Wales. The records included in the data base vary markedly in the number and type of fossils represented, their age, their state of preservation, and the sedimentary context inferred for the period during which they accumulated. These and other constraints on the data are laid out clearly by West, who also discusses some of the uncertainties these constraints introduce. Chapter 4 describes the electronic archive, which is captured in a CD ROM distributed with the book (included in purchase cost). The electronic formatting and structure take a little time to get used to, as the data are presented in ASCII comma-delimited macro-files. While these can be opened and manipulated in EXCEL, I could find no explanation of the necessary procedures that would assist the novice. The tables provide quantified information for each site record on number and type of taxa recorded, the modern habitat for each taxon, modern distributions, and stratigraphic age of records, as well as bibliographic details for sources of the ‘raw’ data. They are not, however, instantly illuminating, and quite a bit of work is required on the part of the operator to establish what meaningful patterns are locked in the data. This raises the question of the usefulness of circulating the data in this manner. Most readers would, I am sure, have preferred the data to have been presented in a more digested and/or interactive format whereas those intending to use the data for research purposes could easily access them if they were made available through the internet. Chapters 6–12 range through various biogeographical parameters that can be inferred from the data, based on (inter alia) the elements of the flora represented, the frequency of occurrence of selected taxa, species variability, and aspects of growth, reproduction and dispersal. Here is where it could have been extremely useful to have been able to work in tandem between the text and the CD ROM, but I could not find a quick way of achieving this. Those more expert in the handling of data bases might have greater success, but for those less practised in the art, some pointers would have been useful. Chapters 11 and 12 present some of the West’s broad conclusions concerning the habitats represented in the data base, as well as certain phytogeographical inferences that emerge from his analysis of the full data base. The third section of the book constitutes the many valuable insights into the problems of interpreting fossil plant records from cold stage deposits. These are scattered throughout the volume, so that the reader has to work hard to find and link them together, with the result that impact is not maximized. There are interesting comments made at irregular intervals about the distinctiveness of the cold stage floras of Britain, and how they differ, sometimes quite markedly, from present-day arctic floras. For example, therophytes occur in relatively high percentages in fossil floras compared with modern arctic communities. There are intriguing questions raised, for example, about the consequences of the development of an arctic-like environment at the latitude of the British Isles, for plants and insects. Again, however, I craved some further conjecture from West as to plausible answers to these questions. The final chapters address some broader themes, such as palaeoclimate reconstructions based upon biological and other information, comparisons of plant records with contemporaneous records of other biota, and a discussion of the ‘Origin and fate of the cold stage stadial flora’. These raise a number of issues familiar to Quaternary palaeobiologists, the overarching thesis being that the biomes that developed in low-latitude regions during ‘stadial’ times were not analogous to those that can be observed in northern latitudes today. There is a cri de coeur in the book for a new terminology to describe past formations, which is independent of the terms applied to define modern formations that have strict climatic connotations. West suggests that the new definitions could be based on the inferred physiognomy of the past vegetation, the benefits of which are not immediately apparent. This may introduce as many problems as are solved. Yet again, a fuller discussion of the issue would have been welcomed. Overall, I have mixed feelings about the book. On the one hand, the data base is an extremely valuable one, and we Quaternary scientists should be grateful to West for pulling all of this information together in a condensed fashion. On the other hand, I did feel that perhaps the opportunity was not grasped to turn a worthy book into a more exciting one. As already noted, there are places where the crucial arguments are not developed enough. There are also some surprising omissions. For me, the most surprising of all is the lack of any significant reference to recently published ice-core records, and to the implications they have for the interpretation of past ‘stadial’ and ‘interstadial’. The remarkable GRIP and GISP records of the last cold stage, for example, which have evidence for up to 24 extremely abrupt and quasi-cyclic Dansgaard–Oeschger cycles (warmings of some 7 °C), raise some fundamental questions of relevance to interpretation of the terrestrial record, as do detailed marine records for the last cold stage, which provide evidence for less frequent, but equally significant, Heinrich Events. These were dramatically sudden cooling events that appear to have had global impacts (Leuschner & Sirocko, 2000). The growing evidence for frequent, very short-lived climate oscillations during cold stages calls into question traditional definitions of ‘stadial’ and ‘interstadial’ events and their associated floras. The likely responses of biota to this kind of oscillatory palaeoclimate background are very difficult to envisage, and represent a challenge to palaeobotanists for future research. Presumably the starting point for such a pursuit is the construction of rigorous archives of the fossil record of the type assembled by West, followed by close scrutiny of the data they contain. It seems quite apt, therefore, that his book closes with the following statement: The database given here (to 1995) can be expanded as new fossil assemblages are described, as taxonomy and definition improves, as dating is improved and as stratigraphy is revised. The present database and the interpretation of cold stage floras discussed here will hopefully form a sound basis for these developments. True, but it is not made clear whether this final message is an invitation to the community to participate in making this a community-shared facility. I hope it is. This book should be considered an essential addition to libraries and laboratories that aim to maintain a comprehensive coverage of publications in Quaternary stratigraphy and/or palaeobotanical research. It is also a key reference for all those embarking on research projects in Quaternary palaeobotany, and a useful reference for those on the fringe of this specialist subject. With respect to the quality of production of the volume, the cover design and fabric, paper and print, and the colour photographs are all of excellent quality. The line diagrams are generally well constructed. Sadly, some of the black-and-white photographs lack contrast, and I could not read the scales in one or two. But, on the whole, it is quite an attractive little book.

The specimen was found in the Cucullaea I allomember of the La Meseta Formation, in a new mammalian locality (IAA 2/16). Notiolofos regueroi sp. nov. shares a brachyodont, lophoselenodont and bicrescentic molar pattern with N. arquinotiensis , recorded for a stratigraphic sequence of 17.5 Ma in Antarctica. The criteria for the species differentiation are the absence of mesial and labial cingulids, the larger paraconid, the wider talonid basin, the accentuated distal projection of the hypoconulid, the centroconid development and the smaller size. Together with the astrapotherian Antarctodon sobrali , they represent the medium to large terrestrial mammals of the early Eocene Antarctic landscape that was mostly dominated by closed forests of Nothofagus . Dental wear facets and differences in their body mass are inferred and discussed as possible evidence of niche differentiation. Additionally, the presence of land mammals with Patagonian affinities in the Eocene of Antarctica reinforces the Cretaceous–Palaeocene presence of the Weddellian Isthmus, a functional land corridor between Antarctica and South America.

Many papers in Keast & Miller (1997), especially Miller (1997), discussed the status
and biogeography of terrestrial organisms in Hawai'i, in the context of the biogeography
of the Pacific Basin. The Hawaiian Islands, by virtue of their geographic isolation, rich volcanic soils, and enormous topographic and climatic diversity, have produced a highly
endemic biota, which includes many of the world's outstanding examples of adaptive radiation. The native biota includes more than 22,400 species (Table 1). The approximately
8,800 terrestrial and aquatic plants and animals have evolved from as few as 1,000 original colonists (Gagné, 1988; see also Sakai et al., 1995), although we suspect the total number of native species and colonists will increase with further study.
The Hawaii Biological Survey continually posts species checklists in searchable interfaces on the web at:
http://www.bishop.hawaii.org/bishop/HBS/
More than 15,000 species are currently available (including terrestrial arthropods,
native and alien land and freshwater snails, foraminiferans, flowering plants, amphibians,
reptiles, birds, and mammals; marine invertebrates are being added). Many gaps in knowledge of the biota of the Hawaiian Islands remain, and many species of protists, algae,
fungi, arthropods, and parasitic helminths need to be investigated.

Understanding how large-bodied herbivorous reptiles engineer ecosystems is relevant given the current interest in restoration of tropical islands where extinction rates are disproportionately high and reptiles are prominent as herbivores. Methods In this study, we measured the ecosystem-level outcomes of long-term quasi-experiment represented by two adjacent islands within the Galapagos Archipelago, one with and the other without Galapagos land iguanas ( Conolophus subcristatus ), large-bodied herbivores known to feed on many plant species. We characterized plant communities on each island by developing high-resolution (&lt;1 cm 2 ) aerial imagery and delineating extent of plant associations and counting individual plants on each. Results In the presence of iguanas there was dramatically less woody plant cover, more area with seasonal grasses, and many fewer cacti. Cacti had a more clumped distribution where iguanas were absent than where iguanas were present. Discussion This study provided strong evidence that Galapagos land iguanas can substantially engineer the structure of terrestrial plant communities; therefore, restoration of large-bodied reptilian herbivores, such as land iguanas and giant tortoises, should be regarded as an important component of overall ecosystem restoration, especially for tropical islands from which they have been extirpated.

",,,,"Penguin colonies significantly influence the distribution and diversity of vegetation communities in Maritime Antarctica, as they serve as vital sources of nutrients for both terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. Remote sensing techniques are becoming increasingly common for monitoring these vast Antarctic areas, especially with Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) imagery, which provides the highest spatial resolutions to date. In fact, the use of hyperspectral (HS) sensors is crucial for accurately identifying and distinguishing between the main ground characteristics and vegetation communities in an Antarctic penguin colony, making this study one of the first UAV-based HS approaches to our knowledge. Consequently, this study provides a spectral library covering the entire spectral range from 400 to 2500 nm for the five main vegetation communities found at Hannah Point penguin colony (Livingston Island, Antarctica). Through this library, two valuable wavelength regions have been identified for distinguishing these communities based on pigments composition, specifically in the green (495–570 nm) and near-infrared (800–900 nm) ranges, that served as a reference for validating the results using 35 ground reference spectrometry data collected in 1667 wavelength bands within the 320–876 nm range. In addition, the supervised classification approach known as the ""Spectral Angle Mapper"" has been employed to monitor the coverage of each vegetation community based on the information provided by the aforementioned spectral library. The observed ecological gradient, which reveals an increase in vegetation complexity away from the high-nutrient content guano areas, highlights the influence of guano on the distribution of the main vegetation patterns across the entire penguin colony. The results of this study could serve as a reference point for more sophisticated research involving the use of UAV-based HS or MS sensors in Antarctica, offering unique opportunities to detect small variations in these remote ecosystems resulting from climate change.

",,"Canadian Science Publishing
",,,,"Climate in high latitude environments is predicted to undergo a pronounced warming and increase in precipitation, which may influence the terrestrial moisture gradients that affect vegetation distribution. Vegetation cover can influence rates of greenhouse gas production through differences in microbial communities, plant carbon uptake potential, and root transport of gases out of the soil into the atmosphere. To predict future changes in greenhouse gas production from High Arctic ecosystems in response to climate change, it is important to understand the interaction between trace gas fluxes and vegetation cover. During the growing seasons of 2008 and 2009, we used dark static chambers to measure CH 4 and N 2 O fluxes and CO 2 emissions at Cape Bounty, Melville Island, NU, across a soil moisture gradient, as reflected by their vegetation cover. In both years, wet sedge had the highest rates of emission for all trace gases, followed by the mesic tundra ecosystem. CH 4 consumption was highest in the polar semi-desert, correlating positively with temperature and negatively with moisture. Our findings demonstrate that net CH 4 uptake may be largely underestimated across the Arctic due to sampling bias towards wetlands. Overall, greenhouse gas flux responses vary depending on different environmental drivers, and the role of vegetation cover needs to be considered in predicting the trajectory of greenhouse gas uptake and release in response to a changing climate.

This overall pattern is primarily associated with habitat loss or degradation, and human persecution for terrestrial mammals, and pollution, open net fishing, climate change, and prey depletion for marine mammals. Mammals play a key role in maintaining ecosystems functionality and resilience, and therefore information on their distribution is crucial to delineate and support conservation actions. MAMMALS IN PORTUGAL is a publicly available data set compiling unpublished georeferenced occurrence records of 92 terrestrial, volant, and marine mammals in mainland Portugal and archipelagos of the Azores and Madeira that includes 105,026 data entries between 1873 and 2021 (72% of the data occurring in 2000 and 2021). The methods used to collect the data were: live observations/captures (43%), sign surveys (35%), camera trapping (16%), bioacoustics surveys (4%) and radiotracking, and inquiries that represent less than 1% of the records. The data set includes 13 types of records: (1) burrows | soil mounds | tunnel, (2) capture, (3) colony, (4) dead animal | hair | skulls | jaws, (5) genetic confirmation, (6) inquiries, (7) observation of live animal (8), observation in shelters, (9) photo trapping | video, (10) predators diet | pellets | pine cones/nuts, (11) scat | track | ditch, (12) telemetry and (13) vocalization | echolocation. The spatial uncertainty of most records ranges between 0 and 100 m (76%). Rodentia (n =31,573) has the highest number of records followed by Chiroptera (n = 18,857), Carnivora (n = 18,594), Lagomorpha (n = 17,496), Cetartiodactyla (n = 11,568) and Eulipotyphla (n = 7008). The data set includes records of species classified by the IUCN as threatened (e.g., Oryctolagus cuniculus [n = 12,159], Monachus monachus [n = 1,512], and Lynx pardinus [n = 197]). We believe that this data set may stimulate the publication of other European countries data sets that would certainly contribute to ecology and conservation-related research, and therefore assisting on the development of more accurate and tailored conservation management strategies for each species.

",,,,"Abstract The coconut crab Birgus latro , the largest terrestrial decapod, is under threat in most parts of its geographical range. Its life cycle involves two biomes (restricted terrestrial habitats near the coast, and salt water currents of the tropical Indian and Pacific Oceans). Its dependence on coastal habitat means it is highly vulnerable to the habitat destruction that typically accompanies human population expansion along coastlines. Additionally, it has a slow reproductive rate and can reach large adult body sizes that, together with its slow movement when on land, make it highly susceptible to overharvesting. We studied the distribution and population changes of coconut crabs at 15 island sites in coastal Tanzania on the western edge of the species' geographical range. Our aim was to provide the data required for reassessment of the extinction risk status of this species, which, despite indications of sharp declines in many places, is currently categorized on the IUCN Red List as Data Deficient. Pemba Island, Zanzibar, in Tanzania, is an important refuge for B. latro but subpopulations are fragmented and exploited by children and fishers. We discovered that larger subpopulations are found in the presence of crops and farther away from people, whereas the largest adult coconut crabs are found on more remote island reserves and where crabs are not exploited. Remoteness and protection still offer hope for this species but there are also opportunities for protection through local communities capitalizing on tourist revenue, a conservation solution that could be applied more generally across the species' range.

","Dana, T.; Daniel, S.; Jesse, P.; Clifford, C.",,,,,2010.0,,,,,,,,,,24,,"Proceedings - Vertebrate Pest Conference
",,,,,,"Introduced Polynesian rats threatened native bird populations and forest habitat on Cocos Island, Guam. To eliminate the threat posed by rat populations, a rodent eradication was conducted on the 33.6-hectare off-shore island in March and April 2009. An integrated approach to eradication was implemented that included trapping, bait stations, and hand broadcast of rodenticide bait. Trapping was conducted within the resort buildings, where human activity precluded the use of rodenticides. Bait stations, employed in commensal resort settings, were designed to prevent terrestrial crabs from accessing the bait. In addition, bait station deployment and retraction methods were used to reduce impacts on daily resort operations. Non-target concerns, primarily with native forest birds during broadcast operations, supported a decision to use diphacinone, a rodenticide with low avian toxicity risk. Bait consumption by the locally threatened Micronesian starling was evident during the broadcast application, but substantial monitoring for non-target impacts revealed no mortality or sublethal effects for starlings or other potential non-targets. Eradication operations on Cocos Island present a prime example of integrated wildlife damage management, combining traditional eradication methods with novel approaches to address site-specific challenges.

",,,,"The relative importance of terrestrial and epiphytic establishment of the emergent tree Metrosideros robusta (Myrtaceae) and its host tree species and sizes, were surveyed in seven different forest types with different disturbance histories in northern New Zealand. At two disturbed sites, M. robusta established terrestrially. At less disturbed sites, most M. robusta were hemi‐epiphytic, but terrestrially established individuals had colonised occasional canopy gaps. M. robusta occurred more commonly on large host trees (>50 cm diameter) than either relative density or relative basal area of host trees would predict, suggesting that large trees are intrinsically better places to establish and not just bigger targets. M. robusta grew on 20 of the 42 tree species sampled. Vitex lucens, dead trees, and the podocarps Dacrydium cupressinum, Dacrycarpus dacrydioides, and Prumnopitys ferruginea were more common as hosts than their relative densities predicted at all sites where they were present. Other host species such as Podocarpus hallii and Laurelia novae‐zelandiae were “preferred” at some sites, but not at others. M. robusta tended to establish in different sites on different host tree species. Hauturu (Little Barrier Island), where the Australian brushtail possum (Trichosurus vulpecula) has never been present, had the highest number of saplings and fewest dead M. robusta, suggesting that this introduced browser is changing the size structure of mainland New Zealand M. robusta populations.","0028-825X

Goniurosaurus lichtenfelderi, a forest-dwelling lizard, is found on both the islands and mainland of northern Vietnam and southern China. The species is categorized as Vulnerable in the IUCN Red List and was recently listed in CITES Appendix II and the Vietnam Government's Decree 06 in 2019 due to severe anthropogenic impacts on its populations. In this study, we employ Maxent species distribution modeling with climatic and vegetation cover data to identify the potential distribution of G. lichtenfelderi. We also used this approach to assess future climate impacts on the potential distribution under different climate change scenarios. Our model predicts that the potential distribution of G. lichtenfelderi will shrink significantly under future scenarios and even vanish in the entire study area under novel environmental conditions of the BCC-CSM 1-1 – RCP 8.5 scenario by the 2070s. Overall, the current potential distribution is expected to shift towards higher latitudes within the next decades. The forecasted maps provide useful guidelines to implement conservation strategies to mitigate synergistic impacts from climate change and other negative anthropogenic activities. In the context of the potentially severe impacts, the border areas between China and Vietnam, Yen Tu Mountain Range, Bai Tu Long National Park, and their surroundings should be considered core refugia for the species, where conservation measures need to be prioritized in the future.

",,,,"Diverse life histories have been documented in terrestrial pulmonates, which inhabit different regions in climate. Life history traits are often phenotypically plastic and vary depending on the environment. Thus, surveys using designs that control for the confounding effects of environment are needed to evaluate the evolutionary differences between populations of closely related species in the wild. We examined the life histories of sibling species of terrestrial pulmonate within two regions of similar climates. Bradybaena pellucida (BP) is endemic to Japanese islands, and has recently been expanding its distribution northeastward, whereas B. similaris (BS) has been introduced by humans into temperate and tropical regions worldwide. We found that these species exhibit discrete differences in population dynamics and life cycle, despite their close relatedness. The annual life cycle of BP is synchronized among individuals in a population. Thus, BP is univoltine with discontinuous generation. In contrast, BS individuals do not synchronize their growth or reproduction, and thus exhibit overlapping generations. Our results indicate that synchronized and non-synchronized population dynamics diverge relatively rapidly in semelparous pulmonates. This type of difference has not been documented in pulmonate life history, and may have been overlooked because only a few studies have explicitly compared life cycles of closely related species within the same climate. Our results provide a basis for further studies of life history evolution in pulmonates.

We tested the rule at an inter-specific level on terrestrial isopods (Oniscidea). We also tested the influence of island area on body size variability. We assembled female size and distribution data from the literature for 901 species of Oniscidea. We compared lengths of insular endemics (N = 296 species) and congeneric or confamilial mainland species (N = 605). We repeated the same analyses for species within climatic zones. We found that isopods do not follow the island rule in either the family or genus level, either globally or within climatic regions. While sizes of island isopods are often different than those of their mainland kin, they show no overall tendency towards dwarfism or gigantism on islands. Island area has no discernible effect on body size. Size variation is similar among insular and mainland species, but the size range is greater in insular species. Globally, the island rule is not supported. Oniscidea are phytosaprophagous feeding on a wide variety of plant material and are preyed upon by a wide range of predators, so that island environment does not exert strong selection pressures on their body size.

However, recent molecular studies using DNA barcoding of the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 gene have suggested at least a 25% underestimation of biodiversity in bats throughout the world. A recent survey of bats in the Dominican Republic documented 15 of the 18 known species on the island of Hispaniola. Phylogenetic analysis of 132 individuals resulted in well-supported monophyletic species-level clades (maximal bootstrap values) with intraspecific variation ranging from 0% to 4.7% and interspecific variation ranging from 14.1% to 32.5%. A phylogeographic pattern separating the northern and southern Dominican Republic was recovered in 3 species of bats (Macrotus waterhousii, Pteronotus parnellii, and Pteronotus quadridens). The inclusion of broader geographic sampling across the Neotropics indicated that 3 widely distributed species (Eptesicus fuscus, Molossus molossus, and Monophyllus redmani) have high sequence divergence among insular or between insular and continental populations. Further systematic study is needed to identify morphologically cryptic species and their implications for conservation priorities in the Caribbean.

Colpocephalum turbinatum was found mainly on terrestrial birds of the order Columbiformes and it may be transferred to predatory birds in the other two orders, but the presence of this parasite on some aquatic birds of prey like osprey may indicate that the ancestors of these birds were terrestrial hunters that acquired this louse from their prey such as doves and pigeons before their transference to aquatic life.

",,,,"Rift Valley fever (RVF) is a vector-borne zoonotic disease that causes high morbidity and mortality in ruminants. In 2008–2009, a RVF outbreak affected the whole Madagascar island, including the Anjozorobe district located in Madagascar highlands. An entomological survey showed the absence of Aedes among the potential RVF virus (RVFV) vector species identified in this area, and an overall low abundance of mosquitoes due to unfavorable climatic conditions during winter. No serological nor virological sign of infection was observed in wild terrestrial mammals of the area, suggesting an absence of wild RVF virus (RVFV) reservoir. However, a three years serological and virological follow-up in cattle showed a recurrent RVFV circulation. The objective of this study was to understand the key determinants of this unexpected recurrent transmission. To achieve this goal, a spatial deterministic discrete-time metapopulation model combined with cattle trade network was designed and parameterized to reproduce the local conditions using observational data collected in the area. Three scenarios that could explain the RVFV recurrent circulation in the area were analyzed: (i) RVFV overwintering thanks to a direct transmission between cattle when viraemic cows calve, vectors being absent during the winter, (ii) a low level vector-based circulation during winter thanks to a residual vector population, without direct transmission between cattle, (iii) combination of both above mentioned mechanisms. Multi-model inference methods resulted in a model incorporating both a low level RVFV winter vector-borne transmission and a direct transmission between animals when viraemic cows calve. Predictions satisfactorily reproduced field observations, 84% of cattle infections being attributed to vector-borne transmission, and 16% to direct transmission. These results appeared robust according to the sensitivity analysis. Interweaving between agricultural works in rice fields, seasonality of vector proliferation, and cattle exchange practices could be a key element for understanding RVFV circulation in this area of Madagascar highlands.

",,,,"Habitat loss and non-native species are 2 of the most important factors that influence native species persistence and behaviors globally. The insectivorous Hawaiian hoary bat (Lasiurus semotus) is the only extant terrestrial mammal native to the Hawaiian Islands. Non-native invasive insectivore species, which are potential competitors of bats for prey, may influence hoary bat behavior. The goal of this study was to determine how small-scale suppression of invasive insectivores (rodents, ants, and yellowjacket wasps [Vespula pensylvanica]) influenced bat activity in grasslands and woodlands. We measured bat activity as a function of the number of distinct minutes in a night containing bat echolocations (bat call minutes) at 20 experimental plots (each 2.25 ha) in a dryland ecosystem on Hawaiʻi Island, November 2016–January 2018. We included 3 predictor variables: vegetation type (woodland, grassland), season (bat reproductive cycle periods: lactation, mating, pre-pregnancy, and pregnancy), and insectivore treatment type (ant suppressed, yellowjacket wasp suppressed, rodent suppressed, combined ant+wasp+rodent suppressed, and no treatment). Bat activity was associated with all 3 predictors using a negative binomial generalized linear model. Bat call minutes and feeding buzzes were twice as high in woodlands than in the grasslands (2.4 and 2.3 times as high, respectively). Bat activity was slightly lower (0.47 bat call min/night fewer) in plots receiving the combined ant + wasp + rodent treatment compared to all other treatment plots. Feeding buzzes did not differ significantly among treatments. Mean activity was lowest during lactation (mid-Jun–Aug). Although woodlands appear particularly important for the Hawaiian hoary bat, small-scale bat activity and foraging do not appear to be strongly affected by resource competition with the invasive insectivores in this study.","0022-541X

Body shape apparently covaries with habitat use within Candoia: the heavy-bodied C. aspera is terrestrial, the elongate C. bibroni arboreal, and C. carinata intermediate in both respects. Females grow larger than males in all three species, and mature at larger sizes. Cloacal spurs were absent in all female C. carinata, most female C. aspera, and almost half of the female C. bibroni. Where present, spurs were smaller in females than in males. Adult females outnumbered males in collections of C. aspera, but not in the other two species. Litter sizes were similar among the three species, averaging 15 to 18 young, with larger females producing larger litters. Only about one-third of adult females were reproductive in each species, suggesting that reproduction may not occur every year in every female. Diets were similar among the three species, with smaller snakes eating lizards (mostly skinks) and larger snakes taking a higher proportion of mammalian prey (mostly rats and mice, but occasionally bandicoots). The diets of Candoia are broadly similar to those of other small boid snakes, both boines and pythonines. However, Candoia tends to resemble boines rather than sympatric pythonines in being relatively heavy-bodied, and (perhaps for this reason) has significantly larger litters relative to maternal SVL than do the Australian pythons.","0022-1511

",,,,"Introduction: Grenada is a rabies endemic country, where terrestrial rabies is maintained in the small Indian mongoose (Herpestes auropunctatus). The role of bats in the epidemiology of rabies in Grenada is unknown. A 1974 report described one rabies virus positive Jamaican fruit bat (Artibeus jamaicensis), and a high seroprevalence in this species. In the current study, the natural exposure to rabies virus in Grenadian bats was re-evaluated. It is postulated that bats serve as a natural rabies reservoir, probably circulating a bat-specific rabies virus variant. Material and methods: Bats were trapped in 2015 in all six parishes of Grenada using mist- and hand nets. For the detection of rabies virus in brain tissue, the direct fluorescent antibody test (dFAT) and the reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) were used. Serum neutralizing antibodies were determined using the fluorescent antibody virus neutralization test (FAVN). Results and discussion: Brain tissue and sera from 111 insectivorous and frugivorous bats belonging to four species were tested (52 Artibeus jamaicensis, two Artibeus lituratus, 33 Glossophaga longirostris, 24 Molossus molossus). Rabies virus antigen and genomic RNA were not detected in brain tissues. Rabies virus neutralizing antibodies were detected in the sera of eight A. jamaicensis in four of the six parishes. Bats in Grenada continue to show natural exposure to rabies virus. As rabies virus was not isolated in this study, serology alone is not sufficient to determine the strain of rabies virus circulating in A. jamaicensis bats in Grenada. Conclusion: Artibeus jamaicensis appears to play a role as a reservoir bat species, which is of public health concern in Grenada. Dispersion of bats to neighboring islands is possible and serological bat surveys should be initiated in these neighboring states, especially in those areas that are free of rabies in terrestrial mammals.

The field research was conducted on the terrace of the eastern part of the island of Lifou in the Loyalty Islands. The terrace, which was once the surrounding reef, has since been raised along with the raising of the atoll. Located between the ocean and the former reef crown, which is now the cliff, the terrace encircles the island. Juvenile crabs were only found under coconut piles at the foot of coconut trees. The largest juvenile crabs collected had a thoracic length (TL) of 28 mm. The number of crabs in coconut piles decreased rapidly above 23 mm TL, which is approximately the size of sexual maturity. No adults were found under coconut piles, as their principal habitat was in burrows located in the calcareous rock beyond the terrace. The smallest juvenile crabs were found near the ocean and the largest close to the cliff-face. During their first terrestrial stages, juvenile coconut crabs carried three kinds of terrestrial gastropod shells according to their size. Those with a TL of less than 2 mm mostly chose Draparnaudia sp., those with a TL between 2 and 4 mm preferred Achatina fulica and those between 4 and 7 mm used Achatina fulica and Placostylus sp. shells with a preference for the latter. All crabs captured ≤ 7 mm TL (n = 32; mean size = 3.7 ± SD 1.4 mm) had a shell, as opposed to all those over 7.8 mm TL (n = 50; mean size = 16.5 ± SD 5.2 mm) which no longer did.","1195-6860

",,,,"This review summarises the ecology and biology of the North Island New Zealand endemic evergreen epiphytic shrub Pittosporum kirkii Hook.f. ex Kirk (Pittosporaceae). While mainly found as an epiphyte associated with other nest epiphytes such as Astelia spp., it also exhibits rupestral and terrestrial lifestyles. Pittosporum kirkii is distinguished from other members of New Zealand Pittosporum by distinctive thick, fleshy, coriaceous leaves, which may assist survival in water-stressed habitats. Water availability is speculated to be the most limiting factor across all of the habitats that P. kirkii occupies and when under water stress, the species utilises a desiccation postponement strategy. Pittosporum kirkii has a restricted distribution with strong habitat preferences restricting it to upper lowland and lower montane mainly old-growth forest ecosystems of the upper North Island. The highest probabilities of P. kirkii occurrence lie within mean annual temperature between 7.8°C and 15.6°C, mean annual rainfall between 1172 and 4432 mm, mean minimum solar radiation in the coldest month between 4.8 and 6.6 MJ/m2/day, and vapour pressure deficits between 0.15 and 0.39 kPa. Pittosporum kirkii is currently listed as at risk–declining and qualified as data-poor and partial decline because of a lack of autecological information. Palatability to introduced brushtail possums and forest clearance have been suggested as the main agents of decline. Due to significant morphological differences between mainland New Zealand and Great Barrier Island/Aotea populations, further study is warranted to determine distinctness. Including P. kirkii in restoration plans and conservation monitoring is recommended in areas where it naturally occurs as this species is recognised as an indicator of overall forest health. Further detailed research on P. kirkii would be invaluable to fill the current gap in knowledge on its ongoing threats, sexual expression, pollination and seed dispersal.","0028-825X

The first study was conducted by questioning 117 farmers about their habits in pesticide use and determining pesticide residues on pepper berries on Bangka Island. Meanwhile, the second study was completed by analyzing exposure levels of pesticide in farmers' bodies before and after pesticide application to pepper plantations at Sukamulya, West Java. Risks of pesticide exposure to below ground terrestrial invertebrates and aquatic ecosystems adjacent to the treated fields were evaluated using scenarios and a decision support system. Results showed that five respondents (4.3%) were agricultural workers without their own plantations and the others were plantation owners. About 112 respondents (95.7%) used pesticides regularly, while 21 respondents (17.9%) had experienced pesticide poisoning. About 54 respondents (46.2%) tended to apply the same pesticide on all occasions, and 104 respondents (88.9%) indicated to always apply a single compound. About 91 respondents (77.8%) were not aware of the possible impact of pesticides on their health, and 102 respondents (87.2%) were not aware of the possible effects on the environment. In addition while spraying pesticides 17 respondents (14.5%) were smoking, 81 respondents (69.2%) were wearing daily clothes, and 84 respondents (71.8%) were throwing empty bottles into the forest. Exposure study revealed that the residues in the urine and blood increased 6.5–10 and 1.1–1.5 folds, respectively indicating actual and direct exposures. The environmental risk assessment indicated low risks for the terrestrial below ground invertebrates but high potential risks for the aquatic ecosystem. The residues of the major pesticides were below the maximum residue limits. This study indicated that the farmers and their workers, and probably also the environment, were at risk of high exposure to the pesticides applied, but that the risks for the consumers were negligible, if present at all. © 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

",,,,"Abstract The spatial structure of host communities is expected to constrain pathogen spread. However, predators and/or scavengers may connect distant host (sub)populations when foraging. Determining whether some individuals or populations play a prominent role in the spread of pathogens is critical to inform management measures. We explored movements and epidemiological status of brown skuas Stercorarius antarcticus , the only avian terrestrial consumer native of Amsterdam Island (Indian Ocean), to assess whether and how they could be involved in the spread of the bacterium Pasteurella multocida , which recurrently causes avian cholera outbreaks in endangered albatross and penguin species breeding on the island. High proportions of seropositive and DNA‐positive individuals for P. multocida indicated that skuas are highly exposed to the pathogen and may be able to transmit it. Movement tracking revealed that the foraging ranges of breeding skuas largely overlap among individuals and expand all along the coasts where albatrosses and penguins nest, but not on the inland plateau hosting the endemic Amsterdam albatross Diomedea amsterdamensis . Considering the epidemiological and movement data, skua movements may provide opportunity for pathogen spread among and within seabird colonies. Synthesis and applications. This work highlights the importance of considering the behaviour and epidemiological status of predators and scavengers in disease dynamics because the foraging movements of individuals of such species can potentially limit the efficiency of local management measures in spatially structured host communities. Such species could thus represent priority vaccination targets to implement efficient management measures aiming at limiting pathogen spread and also be used as sentinels to monitor pathogen circulation and evaluate the effectiveness of management measures.

",,"Brill
",,,,"Talitrids are the only family within the order Amphipoda to have colonised supralittoral and terrestrial environments. They live in a variety of settings, from sandy to rocky and pebble beaches, to river and lake banks, and to leaf litter and caves. A common feature is the absence of a planktonic larval stage to facilitate passive dispersal over long-distances. However, some species have broad distributions. Genetic studies over the past 25 years have tried to explain this apparent contradiction by assessing patterns of species genetic structuring on different geographical scales. Here, we review the molecular studies available to date and focus on the population genetics of talitrids. Most of these studies considered populations in the Mediterranean area, but also along the Atlantic coast and in Canary Island caves. From this review, the group emerges as a potential model to understand processes of dispersal and divergence in non-highly-vagile supralittoral organisms. At the same time, studies on these issues are still too restricted geographically: a worldwide scale including different regions would provide us with a better perspective on these problems.

La famiglia Talitridae è l’unica, all’interno dell’ordine Amphipoda, ad essere rappresentata da specie che hanno colonizzato l’ambiente emerso. Queste si possono trovare in una grande varietà di habitat: dalle spiagge sabbiose, rocciose e ciottolose, alle rive dei fiumi e dei laghi, fino alle lettiere delle foreste umide o agli ambienti cavernicoli. Una caratteristica comune a tutti gli anfipodi è l’assenza di uno stadio larvale planctonico che faciliti o promuova una dispersione passiva su distanze medio-lunghe. Nonostante questo, alcune specie presentano un areale piuttosto esteso. Gli studi genetici condotti negli ultimi 25 anni hanno cercato di spiegare questa apparente contraddizione attraverso stime ed analisi della struttura genetica di specie diverse su scale geografiche più o meno estese. In questo lavoro ci proponiamo quindi di riassumere gli studi molecolari condotti sino ad oggi ed aventi come oggetto la genetica di popolazione degli anfipodi talitridi. La maggior parte dei lavori a disposizione in letteratura considera popolazioni e specie dell’area Mediterranea, ma alcuni coprono anche le coste atlantiche nord-orientali e le grotte delle isole Canarie. Da questi studi emerge chiaramente la grande potenzialità dei talitridi come gruppo-modello ideale per comprendere i processi di dispersione e di divergenza in organismi caratterizzati da bassi livelli di vagilità. Allo stesso tempo, le conclusioni fin qui ottenute si riferiscono ad aree geografiche relativamente limitate: da qui la necessità di ampliare la scala spaziale. Questi lavori rappresenterebbero un contributo sostanziale, consentendo, da un lato, di migliorare la nostra conoscenza dei modelli di strutturazione genetica di questo gruppo di crostacei, e dall’altro di meglio comprendere le dinamiche evolutive che regolano le comunità degli ambienti costieri.","0011-216X

",,"Wiley
",,,,"Vascular plants do not appear to experience mass extinctions (Willis & McElwain, 2002), and, as Traverse (1988) has stressed, 'Plant evolution dances to a different beat'. This may be because of the ecophysiological and reproductive plasticity of many groups of terrestrial plants, as well as of the high frequency with which alterations in embryo development become evolutionarily fixed. It is probable that some aspects of this model will have to be reconsidered in forthcoming years as progress is made in stratigraphic resolution and as we improve the quality of the fossil record (McElwain & Punyasena, 2007). Nevertheless, it is clear that regional extinction events have occurred in plants and that these were related to changes in biome distribution and floristic composition at a continental level (Willis & McElwain, 2002). As biotic responses to climatic change have not been the same in all regions, it is crucial to gather detailed information concerning how these phenomena have varied geographically and to what extent the sequence of bio-diversity loss has affected present-day floristic composition in different parts of the world. It is for this reason that we welcome the study by Postigo et al. (2009), which represents a monumental effort of nomenclatural screening, bibliographic scrutiny, and a broad conceptual consideration of the history of plants in the Iberian Peninsula and the Balearic Islands over the last 65 million years. This review of Cenozoic floras will be of particular use in international palaeontological and neontological contexts because most of the information sources discussed are difficult to find by means of conventional bibliographic and data-search protocols; for example, they include symposium proceedings, conference and unpublished reports, local journals and monographs, which are mostly in Spanish and Portuguese.Postigo et al. (2009) provide a critical review of the floristic composition and ecology of Palaeotropical and Arctotertiary taxa in Cenozoic forest communities and detail the extinctions of a number of families and genera in relation to climate change. Plants have often managed to escape abiotic stress through geographical redistribution, and the Mediterranean region has a number of examples illustrating this (Arroyo et al., 2008). The changes described in Postigo et al. (2009) demonstrate this phenomenon, and it is of particular note that Iberian floras have experienced long periods of persistence compared to floras in the rest of Europe. As Postigo et al. (2009) postulate, this can be reasonably explained using the concept of peninsular refugia (Carrión et al., 2008). However, it is also plausible that complex ecological interactions, including those derived from the enormous faunal diversity of Iberia during the Cenozoic, as well as phylogenetically structured mutualistic networks, provide an environment particularly favourable to climatic resilience. Looking at Postigo et al.'s (2009) database, several examples of the 'Lazarus effect' can be detected, that is, cases for which an apparently extinct taxon reappears in younger rocks. Among others, there are Phaleria and Carpodiptera across the Late Eocene–Early Oligocene interval; Gleicheniaceae and Podocarpus from the Palaeocene to the Oligocene; Chloranthaceae, Restionaceae, Nypa, Myrsinaceae, Simaourabaceae and Cycadaceae across the Palaeocene/Eocene up to the Miocene; Bombacaceae during the end of the Palaeogene; Menispermaceae, Hamamelis, Pittosporum and Celastrus from the Oligocene to the mid-Pliocene; and Engelhardia, Nyssa, Sciadopitys and Symplocos throughout their Palaeogene records. Even more thought-provoking is the possibility of a Signor–Lipps effect in several records. These are situations in which the last occurrences precede the true times of extinction (Taylor, 2004). For example, it may be that several taxa that disappeared during the Zanclean (5.3–3.6 Ma) (e.g. Ginkgo, Cyatheaceae, Clethraceae–Cyrillaceae, Andromeda) may actually have become extinct at the Piacenzian extinction horizon (3.6–2.5 Ma). It is also worth considering whether the significant decline during the middle Chattian, about 25 Ma, in fact corresponds to an Oligocene–Miocene boundary regional extinction. Poor sampling and gaps in the fossil record may have reduced the perceived severity of peninsular extinctions during particular events. Figure 1 summarizes the extinction record depicted by Postigo et al. (2009) (in their figure 4, and tables 1 and 2). The number of extinctions peaks during the Oligocene, with 41.88% of the total Cenozoic disappearances. Oligocene disappearances are even higher (47.84%) if we consider only genera. As Postigo et al. (2009) indicate, Miocene extinctions are also significant (27.44% of total taxa), although the Pliocene and Quaternary periods do not include high numbers of extinctions (10.47 and 8.66%, respectively). However, the situation is very different if we take into account extinction rates (Fig. 1): whereas the Oligocene has a large value (10.67 total taxa Ma−1), the Pliocene (8.22 taxa Ma−1) and Quaternary (13.29 taxa Ma−1) also have high rates of phytodiversity loss. More specifically, as seen from data shown in Postigo et al.'s figure 4, major biotic crises are indicated at the end of the Oligocene (c. 28–23 Ma), at the Piacenzian (3.6–2.5 Ma), and during the Lower–Mid Pleistocene transition (1.4–0.7 Ma). The last of these was probably associated with the beginning of the 100-kyr climatic cyclicity and a general cooling trend. Number of extinctions accumulated per geological period, and extinction rate (taxa Ma−1) of Iberian and Balearic vascular plants during the Cenozoic. Percentages in brackets. Data source: Postigo et al. (2009). Taken together, these new data open up exciting avenues for future research; for example, a quantitative study to compare the per taxon extinction, the extinction rates, and the per taxon extinction rates in the Iberian Peninsula with those of the rest of the European continent. This may allow clarification of the post-extinction diversification dynamics and biotic interchanges in plants of the region. Lineage extinction is also a promising topic of research, considering the phylogenetic relatedness between several groups of the taxa analysed. Equally interesting would be the capability to uncouple ecological and taxonomic impacts (McGhee et al., 2004) in each of the temporal extinction windows, although, in this case, it would be necessary to compare the data with the avian, terrestrial tetrapod and insect fossil records. The final aim would be to ascertain the level of collapse in the pre-existing ecosystem. Clearly, not all taxa in an ecosystem have the same importance. In the Iberian Peninsula, few will doubt that the selective removal of the Oligocene tropical group during the Chattian (28–23 Ma; including the Bombacaceae, Nyctaginaceae and Annonaceae); of Torreya at c. 7 Ma; and of the Arecaceae, Ebenaceae, Magnoliaceae and Sapindaceae during the Early Pliocene, c. 3 Ma, must have had a tremendous impact on the ecological structure of communities. This is especially true for those possessing megafauna dispersal-syndrome fruits (e.g. Icacinaceae, Passifloraceae, Annonaceae, Sapotaceae) (Guimarães et al., 2008). Finally, we should not forget that biodiversity losses not only result from high extinction rates, but may also result from a depression in the rate of species production, or from some combination of both processes.

846.0,"Conservation implications of feral pigs in island and mainland ecosystems, and a case study of feral pig expansion in California
","Rick, A.",,Mainland; Feral cat,,,1998.0,,,,,,,,,,18,,"Proceedings - Vertebrate Pest Conference
",,,,,,"Feral pigs (Sus scrofa) are an exotic ungulate which have been widely introduced worldwide with multiple ecosystem and economic consequences. The author conducted a semi-comprehensive literature review directed at identifying the current state of knowledge related to the effects of feral pigs on island and mainland plant and animal communities. Also, the author describes the situation in California where feral pigs that were introduced in the late 1700s are now widespread due to hunting-related introductions and natural range extensions. Feral pigs on predator-free oceanic islands are a serious conservation problem because they attain high densities and have contributed to near-extinctions and extinctions of multiple endemic plants and vertebrates. In mainland ecosystems, however, feral pigs can have both positive and negative effects depending on the local circumstances. Rooting, for example, can have both positive and negative effects on growth and survival of some trees, soils and soil processes, and the distribution of native and exotic grasses. In general, however, the negative effects of rooting by feral pigs are amplified when population densities are high. Feral pigs may compete with native species for limited resources, but there are limited data relevant to this hypothesis. Based on observations of small amounts of animal matter in their diets, feral pigs eat terrestrial vertebrates and eggs of ground nesting birds, but the importance of predation by feral pigs on native vertebrates is poorly known. Feral pigs also may have important indirect effects in mainland ecosystems by providing a new prey base for native predators which may then increase. In areas of Europe with extant wolf (Canis lupus) populations, wild boar (Sus scrofa) are an important prey species which may be facilitating numerical and geographic recoveries of wolves. Because wild boar are important prey for endangered Amur tigers (Panthera tigris), they are considered important for recovering tiger populations. In Australia, feral pigs are potentially important prey for dingoes (Canis familiaris dingo); whereas, in the United States, endangered Florida panthers (Felis concolor coryi) consumed 23% to 59% feral pigs, and mountain lions (Felis concolor) in Texas and California consumed 5% to 38% feral pigs. Research needs for feral pigs include quantitatively assessing: 1) how acorn foraging by feral pigs limits or influences regeneration of oaks (Quercus sp.); 2) the competitive effects of feral pigs on native species; 3) whether direct predation by feral pigs suppresses small vertebrate populations; and 4) how the availability of feral pigs as prey influences native predator populations.

We present an overview of so called cleaner birds from the Neotropics based on field records, literature, and photo survey. We found that 33 bird species in 16 families practice cleaning even if some of them do so very occasionally. The birds range from the Galápagos ground finch Geospiza fuliginosa to the widespread black vulture Coragyps atratus. Clients mostly are large herbivores such as capybaras, deer, and livestock, but also include medium-sized herbivores such as iguanas and tortoises, and carnivores such as boobies and seals - a few bird species associate with these latter marine mammals. No carnivorous terrestrial mammal client is recorded to date except for a domestic dog, from whose hair black vultures picked organic debris. Some clients adopt particular inviting postures while being cleaned, whereas others are indifferent or even disturbed by the activity of cleaner birds. Capybaras, giant tortoises, and iguanas are among the inviting clients, whereas boobies try to dislodge the 'vampire' finch Geospiza difficilis. Most of the Neotropical cleaner birds may be lumped in one broad category (omnivores that dwell in open areas and associate with large to medium-sized herbivores). A second, restricted category accommodates some species from Patagonia and the Galápagos Islands (omnivores that dwell in open areas and associate with carnivorous marine mammals, or seabirds and marine reptiles). Two still more restricted categories accommodate the following: 1) forest-dwelling cleaner birds; and 2) marine coastal cleaners. Additional records of Neotropical cleaner birds will mostly fall in the broad category.

However, limited research has explored the diversity, distribution, and influencing variables of these gastropods. This study sampled gastropods in tropical montane rainforests by establishing 10-50 1m2 sampling plots across 60 randomly selected sites. Among the 46 recorded species, 79% were native, and 17% were exotic. Representative species of the five endemic genera to the island and two endemic semi-slug species were recorded from these forests. Native gastropod species were primarily found in forest interiors, while exotic species inhabited forest buffer regions. The distribution of most native species is influenced by elevation, air temperature, relative humidity, rainfall, and soil pH, while elevation and rainfall play a significant role in the distribution of most exotics. Exotics display broader environmental tolerance compared to natives, enabling exotics to invade the forests. The restricted habitat of many native species within deep canopy forests makes them highly vulnerable to habitat change, whereas exotics thrive under altered conditions.

",,,,"The world-famous upper Miocene fossil localities on the Aegean island of Samos in Greece have produced a rich fossil record that sheds light on the evolution of eastern Mediterranean terrestrial faunas over a one-million-year interval of the late Neogene. Fossils have been discovered on Samos since antiquity, although a succession of paleontological and commercial collecting expeditions over the last 130 years has resulted in specimens now being distributed throughout museums all over the world. Here, we survey the fossil tortoise remains from Samos, which are significant because they include early antecedents of the modern Testudo lineage, together with spectacular examples of the European Neogene gigantic testudinid †Titanochelon, which represents one of the largest-bodied terrestrial turtle taxa documented to date. All of the Samos fossils derive from the Mytilinii Formation, which spans the late MN11–early MN13 Neogene land mammal zones. The small-bodied tortoise remains include two incomplete shells that are morphologically consistent with basal testudonans and phylogenetically distinct from the coeval species Testudo marmorum found on mainland Greece. The Samos gigantic tortoise †‘Testudo’ schafferi was based on a spectacularly large skull and femur. However, we describe new plastron fragments, limb elements, and osteoderms that are compatible with †Titanochelon specimens from southern Greece and Anatolia. This could imply faunal links with the distinctive ‘Pikermian’ local assemblages from Asia Minor and concurs with the proposed late Miocene–Pliocene biogeographic segregation of large mammals from the eastern Aegean margin and Turkey relative to those occurring in northwestern Greece and the Balkan Peninsula.","0272-4634

In 2009, scat surveys were conducted to assess road use by the Iriomote cat, and prey surveys were undertaken in the morning and at night, mainly targeting terrestrial frogs and reptiles. To analyse the importance of factors related to road use by the Iriomote cat, the influences of prey density along road types, habitat types, presence or absence of road construction activities, and survey regions on number of scats were examined using nested generalised linear models (GLM), assuming Poisson error and a log-link function.

",,,,"Invasive species have already reduced biodiversity, damaged the environment, threatened human health, and created economic losses worldwide. Alaska, by contrast, had relatively few invasive species for most of the 20th century. But increased population and development in recent years have brought an influx of non-native species. However, the problem remains in its infancy, and Alaska still has the opportunity to take advantage of cost-effective management, given appropriate coordination among government agencies and private groups. To help improve such coordination and increase public understanding about this issue, the authors collected data on spending to manage invasive species in Alaska between 2007 and 2011. Such spending increased from $4.7 million in 2007 to $6.9 million in 2010, and it totaled $29 million over the entire study period. Federal agencies paid 84% of that total, non-profits paid 9%, the State of Alaska paid 5%, local governments paid 2%, and private donors paid less than 1%. Most spending (79%) targeted invasive terrestrial plants and animals, but spending for invasive marine and freshwater organisms increased over the period. The largest individual expenses were for eradicating Norway rats that were killing bird populations on an Aleutian island ($5 million), northern pike that were eating juvenile salmon in lakes of Southcentral Alaska ($2.7 million), and European rabbits that were destroying bird habitat in southwestern Alaska ($0.8 million). Overall, research accounted for 24%, monitoring for 20%, eradication for 20%, administration and planning for 11%, and other spending for 25% of total expenditures. The number of jobs in managing invasive species increased over the study period, as did volunteer efforts, which may suggest increasing public awareness about this issue in Alaska.

","Clark, Geoffrey",,Zooarchaeology,,,1997.0,,,200,219,,,,,,36,2,"Asian perspectives
",,"University of Hawaii Press
",,,,"ZOO ARCHAEOLOGICAL STUDIES OF WILD and domesticated animals demonstrate
the diversity of information that can be obtained from their bones (CluttonBrock and Grigson 1984; Davis 1987). The examination of species that were
closely associated with prehistoric people is particularly useful, as those commensal species served past societies' economic, ceremonial, and industrial needs
(Bartosiewicz 1984; Clutton-Brock 1981; Smith 1969). Much of the morphological variation found in commensal remains was once thought to be the result of
purposeful human selection (Belyaev 1979; Bokonyi 1969; Scott 1955; Zeuner
1963). However, there is increasing data to suggest that it is the anthropogenic
environment itself which sets many of the animals' morphological and behavioral
parameters (Clutton-Brock 1992; Morey 1994; Tchernov and Horwitz 1991).
Thus the geographic and temporal variation found in commensal remains will
provide information about the animals themselves, but also has the potential to
throw light on the prehistoric human environment in which they once lived.
This paper suggests that the analysis of commensal remains, even at a coarse scale,
has the capability to inform prehistorians of large-scale changes occurring in a
prehistoric society.
In Oceania, work on the primary (Polynesian dog Canisfamiliaris, pig Sus scrofa,
fowl Gallus gallus) and secondary (Pacific or Polynesian rat Rattus exulans or concolor) commensals has generally been limited to two approaches. The first of these
involves the synthesis of historical and archaeological data to determine the animal's geographic and temporal distribution (Baldwin 1990; Cassels 1983; Kirch
1984; Urban 1961). The second approach is concerned with estimating prehistoric human subsistence from the identification and quantification of commensal
remains from archaeological sites (Emory and Sinoto 1961; Kirch 1973; Rolett
1992). Morphological examination is surprisingly rare, given the early interest
(Ball 1933; Miller 1906,1924; Wood-Jones 1931) and the potential of such study
(Wood-Jones 1929: 329). In part, this lack of inquiry can be attributed to poorly excavated or curated remains, the dispersed nature of archaeological collections,
and the often small sample size from an individual site or island. These difficulties
aside, the diverse environments and cultures found in this region provide an
opportunity to study commensal skeletal variation through time and between
archipelagoes.
The Polynesian dog of New Zealand (kuri) has been the subject of study and
discussion since the late nineteenth century. Interest in the kuri is due largely to it
being the largest terrestrial mammalian carnivore in prehistoric New Zealand and
to the fact that only the kuri and the Pacific rat were successfully established by
Maori (Anderson 1990; Bay-Petersen 1984; McGlone et al. 1994). The demise
of the kuri, caused by interbreeding with introduced European dogs (Anderson
1990; Colenso 1878), means that it is primarily through analysis of its biological
remains that information about this extinct breed can be furthered. The archaeological utility of the kuri lies in its close association with Maori, as it was used for
a number of purposes both functional and cultural (Allo 1970; Clark 1996;
Luomala 1960; Schwimmer 1963). ","0066-8435

Three Malaise traps were installed for each sampling points of the plot areas (i.e. coastal and inland forest). The insect samples were collected after seven days and brought to the laboratory for sorting, enumerating and identifying from order up to family level. The abundance of parasitoids collected was analyzed using T-test analysis and Kruskal-Wallis test whilst their diversity was analyzed using the Shannon-Weiner Diversity Index (H'). A total of 25 hymenopteran parasitoids comprising of 10 families were identified. The most abundance families recorded was Braconidae with eight individuals followed by Ceraphronidae with six individuals whilst Figitidae, Scelionidae and Trichogrammatidae represented by two individuals, respectively. The diversity of Hymenopteran parasitoids in the coastal forest showed higher diversity value with H'=2.03 than in the inland forest (H'=1.17). The abundance of Hymenopteran parasitoids individuals, however, was not significantly different (p > 0.05) between coastal forest and the inland forest plots. Overall, this study showed that the diversity of Hymenopteran parasitoids was higher in the coastal forest although the abundance was not obviously differed from the inland forest of Perhentian Island. For the future, vegetation species, distribution and abiotic factors can be taken into consideration in determining the diversity and abundance of Hymenopteran parasitoids in an island forest.","2180-1983

",,,,"Reindeer and caribou are terrestrial herbivores, that feed on lichens and are used for commercial and subsistence food products. Caribou are a key component of the arctic food web and the bioaccumulation of toxic contaminants, such as mercury (Hg), needs to be monitored to establish a baseline as the arctic environment is impacted by both climate change and future industrial development. A changing climate in Alaska is influencing plant species composition, fire regime, melting and flooding events, and thus, impacting Hg bioavailability in the food chain. Industrial development in Asia is also projected to increase the atmospheric global pool of Hg from increased coal combustion. Reindeer, a domesticated representative of caribou, can be used as a terrestrial biomonitor for metal exposure. In this study total mercury concentrations were measured in lichens and in hair of grazing reindeer on defined ranges across Alaska to establish a baseline for future hypothesis development and testing regarding Hg deposition. The Hg mean level for Seward Peninsula lichens on the Davis Range was 37.4 ng g−1, on the Gray Range 47.1 ng g−1, on the Kakaruk Range 42.2 ng g−1, and 41.7 ng g−1 on the Noyakuk Range. Lichen Hg levels on St. Lawrence Island was 46.6 ng g−1. Methyl mercury levels in lichens were found to be below detection levels. Reindeer grazing on these ranges had mean Hg hair levels of 14.6 ng g−1 (Davis herd), 83.4 ng g−1 (Gray herd), and 40.3 ng g−1 (Noyakuk herd). Two reindeer on St. Lawrence Island had an average of Hg of 43.0 ng g−1. Sample sizes ranged from n = 2 to n = 11. Hg mean levels in lichen on Seward Peninsula were higher than Hg means of two ranges in northern Mongolia. The Hg levels observed in this study indicate that Hg levels in Alaska are low at this time and pose no risk to the health of reindeer or human subsistence harvesters. A significant relationship between Hg in lichens on the ranges and the Hg in reindeer on those ranges has not been established. There are insufficient data on Hg levels in many areas of the north and more information is needed on location specific and time trends in Hg concentrations. Lichens and reindeer hair provide a good, non-invasive method of monitoring metal exposure changes in Alaskan ecosystems.","0032-2474

",,,,"Abstract Anthropogenic mortality is a major cause of global mortality in terrestrial vertebrates. Quantifying its impact on the dynamics of threatened species is essential to improve their conservation. We investigated cause-specific mortality in Canarian houbara bustards ( Chlamydotis undulata fuertaventurae ), an endangered subspecies endemic to the Canary Islands. We monitored 51 individuals tagged with solar-powered GSM/GPRS loggers for an average of 3.15 years, and recorded 7 casualties at aerial lines (13.73% of the sample; 5 at power lines, 2 at telephone lines), 1 (1.96%) at a wire fence, 4 road kills (7.84%) and 1 case of predation by cat (1.96%). Cox proportional hazards models showed that anthropogenic and natural annual mortality rates were similar (respectively, 6.20% and 6.36% of the individuals). We estimate that 33–35 houbaras die each year in the Canary Islands due to anthropogenic causes. Population viability models using these data and juvenile productivity values obtained over seven years predicted the extinction of the species in 50 years. Eliminating anthropogenic mortality, the population could be recovered, but would still require management actions to improve habitat quality. Conservation measures to reduce anthropogenic mortality due to power line fatalities, roadkills and predation by cats, as well as to increase productivity, are urgently needed, particularly on Fuerteventura, where houbaras are on the brink of extinction.

",,"Wiley
",,,,"Abstract An animal's movement rate is a central metric of movement ecology as it correlates with its energy acquisition and expenditure. Obtaining accurate estimates of movement rate is challenging, especially in small highly mobile species where GPS battery size limits fix frequency, and geolocation technology limits positions’ precision. In this study, we used high GPS fix frequencies to evaluate movement rates in eight territorial arctic foxes on Bylot Island (Nunavut, Canada) in July–August 2018. We also assessed the effects of fix interval and location error on estimated movement rates. We obtained 96 fox‐days of data with a fix interval of 4 min and 12 fox‐days with an interval of 30 s. We subsampled the latter dataset to simulate six longer fix intervals ranging from 1 to 60 min and estimated daily distances traveled by adding linear distances between successive locations. When estimated with a fix interval of 4 min, daily distances traveled by arctic foxes averaged 51.9 ± 11.7 km and reached 76.5 km. GPS location error averaged 11 m. Daily distances estimated at fix intervals longer than 4 min were greatly underestimated as fix intervals increased, because of linear estimation of tortuous movements. Conversely, daily distances estimated at fix intervals as small as 30 s were likely overestimated due to location error. To our knowledge, no other territorial terrestrial carnivore was shown to routinely travel daily distances as large as those observed here for arctic foxes. Our results generate new hypotheses and research directions regarding the foraging ecology of highly mobile predators. Furthermore, our empirical assessment of the effects of fix interval and location error on estimated movement rates can guide the design and interpretation of future studies on the movement ecology of small opportunistic foragers.

",,,,"Although there are no published studies and limited data documenting damage by rodents in Hawaiian caves, our incidental observations during more than 40 years of surveying caves indicate that introduced rodents, especially the roof rat, Rattus rattus, pose significant threats to vulnerable cave resources. Caves, with their nearly constant and predictable physical environment often house important natural and cultural features including biological, paleontological, geological, climatic, mineralogical, cultural, and archaeological resources. All four invasive rodents in Hawai'i commonly nest in cave entrances and rock shelters, but only the roof rat (Rattus rattus) habitually enters caves and utilizes areas in total darkness. Skeletons and feces have been found in the deepest passages, sometimes over a kilometer from the nearest known entrance although the animals may have used nearby small, inconspicuous entrances. Their impacts include damage to rare native plants in cave entrances; predation on vulnerable cave-inhabiting species, such as Thaumatogryllus tree crickets, and native moths roosting in caves; destruction of the irreplaceable remains of the extinct terrestrial fauna; damage to organic material associated with cultural and archaeological resources, thereby obscuring the historical record of humans in the islands; introduction of unnatural nutrients into subterranean ecosystems via their bodies and feces allowing the colonization of caves by other harmful alien species; and disturbance of research sites. Furthermore, the extirpation of colonies of cave-roosting moths has impacted native birds nesting in the entrance and twilight zones.

Resource selection is a useful technique that can address this issue. In 2014, we investigated resource selection of Hochstetter's frogs (Leiopelma hochstetteri) in mature (>30 year) exotic pine (Pinus radiata) plantations and regenerating native broadleaf forests in Torere Forest (Bay of Plenty, North Island), New Zealand, where harvesting of pines threatens this population. We then determined whether key habitats were present at the proposed target translocation site, Orokonui Ecosanctuary (Dunedin, South Island), New Zealand. In Torere Forest, we conducted daytime searches for frogs along streams and recorded microhabitats (e.g., cobbles) in used and random available plots. In Orokonui, we recorded microhabitats in randomly distributed plots because Hochstetters's frogs are presently absent. We used averaged mixed (binomial) models to identify important resources in pine plantations and native forests and to compare resource use between habitats. Finally, we predicted habitat use in Orokonui and Torere Forest to gain an indication of habitat suitability. Frogs predominantly selected cobble microhabitats in pine plantations and native forests but also partially decayed logs ≥15 cm in diameter within pine plantations. In contrast, high gravel cover and sand-silt were avoided by frogs. In response to limited cobble cover in pine plantations, frogs were more generalized in selecting resources (primarily logs) than in native forests. Habitat suitability was slightly lower in pine plantations compared to native forests, but mature pine plantations do provide suitable habitat for Hochstetter's frogs, at least in the short term prior to pine harvesting. Our study suggests that Orokonui provides suitable habitat for the proposed translocation of Hochstetter's frogs. © 2016 The Wildlife Society.","0022-541X

",,,,"Invertebrates constitute the most diverse Pacific island animal lineages and have correspondingly suffered the most devastating extinction rates. Losses of native invertebrate lineages have been driven largely by ecosystem changes brought about by loss of habitat and direct predation by introduced species. Although Hawai‘i notably lacks native terrestrial reptiles and amphibians, both intentional and unintentional anthropogenic releases of herpetofauna have resulted in establishment of more than two dozen species of frogs, toads, turtles, lizards, and a snake. Despite well-known presence of nonnative predatory species in Hawai‘i, ecological impacts remain unstudied for a majority of these species. In this study, we evaluated diet of the Japanese wrinkled frog, Glandirana rugosa, an intentional biocontrol release in the Hawaiian Islands in the late nineteenth century. We collected live frogs on O‘ahu and used museum collections from both O‘ahu and Maui to determine exploited diet composition. These data were then compared with a published dietary analysis from the native range in Japan. We compiled and summarized field and museum distribution data from O‘ahu, Maui, and Kaua‘i to document current range of this species. Gut content analyses suggest that diet composition in the Hawaiian Islands is significantly different from that in its native Japan. In the native range, dominant taxonomic groups by volume were Coleoptera (beetles), Lepidoptera (moths, butterflies), and Formicidae (ants). Invasive frogs in Hawai‘i exploited mostly Dermaptera (earwigs), Amphipoda (landhoppers), and Hemiptera (true bugs). In Hawai‘i this species also exploited endemic insects (∼4% total volume, 7 genera) and snails (14 snails in three endemic genera). Our results suggest the need for more indepth assessment of ecological impacts of G. rugosa and other established herpetofauna in Hawai‘i to improve our ability to prevent and manage ecological damage and ultimately restore diverse island ecosystems.","0030-8870

In addition, knowledge of whether and how historical contingencies affect microbial distributions at small spatial scales is lacking. Here, we analyzed soil-borne microbial (bacterial, archaeal, and fungal) communities in 12 quadrat plots around the Fildes Region of King George Island, maritime Antarctica, and the communities were divided into two groups according to the soil elemental compositions and environmental attributes of Holocene raised beach and Tertiary volcanic stratigraphy. Prokaryotic communities of the two groups were well separated; the prokaryotic data were primarily correlated with soil elemental compositions and were secondly correlated with environmental attributes (e.g., soil pH, total organic carbon, NO3-, and vegetation coverage; Pearson test, r = 0.59 vs. 0.52, both P < 0.01). The relatively high abundance of P, S, Cl, and Br in Group 1 (Holocene raised beach site) was likely due to landform uplift. Lithophile-elements (Si, Al, Ca, Sr, Ti, V, and Fe) correlated with prokaryotic communities in Group 2 may have originated from weathering of Tertiary volcanic rock. No significant correlations were found between the fungal community distribution and both the soil elemental composition and environmental attributes in this study; however, Monte Carlo tests revealed that elements Sr and Ti, soil pH, sampling altitude, and moss and lichen species numbers had significant impacts on fungal communities. The elements and nutrients accumulated during the formation of different landforms influenced the development of soils, plant growth, and microbial communities, and this resulted in small-scale spatially heterogeneous biological distributions. These findings provide new evidence that geological evolutionary processes in the Fildes Region were crucial to its microbial community development, and the results highlight that microbial distribution patterns are the legacies of historical events at this small spatial scale. Based on this study, the ice-free regions in maritime Antarctica represent suitable research sites for studying the influence of geomorphological features on microbial distributions, and we envision the possibility of a site-specific landform assignment through the analysis of the soil prokaryotic community structure.

As a result, future changes to their distribution may be important determinants of ecosystem carbon (C) cycling in a warmer world. We assessed the role of a foundation tussock sedge ( Eriophorum vaginatum ) as a climatically vulnerable C stock using field data, a machine learning ecological niche model, and an ensemble of terrestrial biosphere models (TBMs). Field data indicated that tussock density has decreased by ∼0.97 tussocks per m 2 over the past ∼38 years on Alaska’s North Slope from ∼1981 to 2019. This declining trend is concerning because tussocks are a large Arctic C stock, which enhances soil organic layer C stocks by 6.9% on average and represents 745 Tg C across our study area. By 2100, we project that changes in tussock density may decrease the tussock C stock by 41% in regions where tussocks are currently abundant (e.g. −0.8 tussocks per m 2 and −85 Tg C on the North Slope) and may increase the tussock C stock by 46% in regions where tussocks are currently scarce (e.g. +0.9 tussocks per m 2 and +81 Tg C on Victoria Island). These climate-induced changes to the tussock C stock were comparable to, but sometimes opposite in sign, to vegetation C stock changes predicted by an ensemble of TBMs. Our results illustrate the important role of tussocks as a foundation species in determining future Arctic C stocks and highlight the need for better representation of this species in TBMs.

",,"Springer Nature
",,,,"Abstract Background Non-native wild pigs ( Sus scrofa ) threaten sensitive flora and fauna, cost billions of dollars in economic damage, and pose a significant human–wildlife conflict risk. Despite growing interest in wild pig research, basic life history information is often lacking throughout their introduced range and particularly in tropical environments. Similar to other large terrestrial mammals, pigs possess the ability to shift their range based on local climatic conditions or resource availability, further complicating management decisions. The objectives of this study were to (i) model the distribution and abundance of wild pigs across two seasons within a single calendar year; (ii) determine the most important environmental variables driving changes in pig distribution and abundance; and (iii) highlight key differences between seasonal models and their potential management implications. These study objectives were achieved using zero-inflated models constructed from abundance data obtained from extensive field surveys and remotely sensed environmental variables. Results Our models demonstrate a considerable change in distribution and abundance of wild pigs throughout a single calendar year. Rainfall and vegetation height were among the most influential variables for pig distribution during the spring, and distance to adjacent forest and vegetation density were among the most significant for the fall. Further, our seasonal models show that areas of high conservation value may be more vulnerable to threats from wild pigs at certain times throughout the year, which was not captured by more traditional modeling approaches using aggregated data. Conclusions Our results suggest that (i) wild pigs can considerably shift their range throughout the calendar year, even in tropical environments; (ii) pigs prefer dense forested areas in the presence of either hunting pressure or an abundance of frugivorous plants, but may shift to adjacent areas in the absence of either of these conditions; and (iii) seasonal models provide valuable biological information that would otherwise be missed by common modeling approaches that use aggregated data over many years. These findings highlight the importance of considering biologically relevant time scales that provide key information to better inform management strategies, particularly for species whose ranges include both temperate and tropical environments and thrive in both large continental and small island ecosystems.

The samples (mix of soil and organic detritus) were collected from ground of cave entrance.The samples were characterized by low diatom diversity and strongly dominated by terrestrial (soil) forms.

Whereas most of taxa of the enumerated genera were identifiable, only one among four Luticola species distinguished in the samples studied was identified. This taxon was L. ectorii, a cosmopolitan species known previously from South America (Brazil) and Asia (China). The three remaining species could not be assigned to any established species. Therefore, based on external and internal morphological features from light and scanning electron microscopic analysis, we describe here three species new to science, including: L. georgzizkae, L. rapanuiensis and L. moaiorum. All three taxa new to science are compared to established Luticola species and their significance for the global distribution of the genus is discussed.

",,,,"European islands are hotspots of biological and cultural diversity, which, compared to mainland, are more vulnerable to climate change, tourism development, uncontrolled land-use changes and the consequences of financial crisis. These drivers of change have increasingly resulted in severe impacts on socio-economic and environmental parameters. Projected climate, land-use and socio-economic change will impact on islands’ biodiversity, ecosystem services and, in turn, on the quality of life of island inhabitants. Even if the existing methods can adequately predict the abovementioned changes of the larger islands, this is not the case for small and medium-size islands, where there is a need for refinement. Although ecosystem services (ES) assessments have been carried out worldwide in different geographical areas, islands are still under-represented. Despite the recognised islands’ importance and vulnerability, efforts to date have focused solely on the pressures they face. Still, we know little about ES supply, flow and demand and their spatio-temporal variability, whilst integrated approaches that consider ES cross-island realms (terrestrial, marine and their interface) remain scarce. Even more under-represented are studies that explore the telecoupled relationship amongst islands and their mainland counterparts. Moreover, the current conceptual approaches guiding ES mapping and assessment need further refinement to account for the complex manifestations of nature and culture arising from peoples’ interaction with island spaces. This paper discusses the creation of a platform for coordinated interdisciplinary research on several aspects of mapping and assessment of ES in small and medium European islands in order to synthesise and strengthen the knowledge base for conservation of island realms and contribute to their sustainable development.

",,,,"Adélie penguins (Pygoscelis adeliae) are the most numerous flightless bird group breeding in coastal areas of Maritime and Continental Antarctica. Their activity leaves a mark on the land in the form of large guano deposits. This guano is an important nutrient source for terrestrial habitats of ice-free Antarctic areas, most notably by being the source of ammonia vapors which feed the surrounding grass, lichen and algae communities. Although investigated by researchers, the fate of the guano-associated microbial community and its role in decomposition processes remain vague. Therefore, by employing several direct community assessment methods combined with a broad culture-based approach we provide data on bacterial numbers, their activity and taxonomic affiliation in recently deposited and decayed Adélie penguin guano sampled at the Point Thomas rookery in Maritime Antarctica (King George Island). Our research indicates that recently deposited guano harbored mostly bacteria of penguin gut origin, presumably inactive in cold rookery settings. This material was rich in mesophilic enzymes active also at low temperatures, likely mediating early stage decomposition. Fresh guano colonization by environmental bacteria was minor, accomplished mostly by ammonia scavenging Jeotgalibaca sp. cells. Decayed guano contained 10-fold higher bacterial numbers with cold-active enzymes dominating the samples. Guano was colonized by uric-acid degrading and lipolytic Psychrobacter spp. and proteolytic Chryseobacterium sp. among others. Several spore-forming bacteria of penguin gut origin persisted in highly decomposed material, most notably uric-acid fermenting members of the Gottschalkiaceae family.

",,,,"Using distribution data of 131 terrestrial bird species on 17 islands of the Archipelago Sabana–Camagüey, Cuba, we tested for non–randomness in presence–absence matrices with respect to co–occurrence and nestedness. We conducted separate analyses for the whole assemblage and sub–matrices according to trophic levels and residence status (breeding and migratory). We also explored the influence of weighting factors such as island area and isolation. The C–occurrence analyses were susceptible to the species subsets and the weighting factors. Unweighted analyses revealed a significant negative co–occurrence pattern for the entire assemblage and for most sub–matrices. The area weighted analyses always indicated strong non–random structure. However, an analysis with intra–guild species pairs showed that most pairs were randomly assembled; very few pairs had a significant segregated pattern. Bird assemblages followed a nested subset structure across islands. Nestedness was strongly correlated with area and unrelated with island isolation. Overall, this study suggests that terrestrial bird assemblages were shaped by extinction processes mediated through area effects rather than interspecific trophic guild competition. Data suggest that conservation of largest islands will guarantee high terrestrial bird richness on the archipelago.

In April 1998, a group of biologists specializing in different taxa conducted a Conservation International (CI)-initiated Rapid Assessment Program (RAP) of the Wapoga River Area in Irian Jaya, the Indonesian part of New Guinea. Their primary mission was to provide data on the biota of this barely explored area for potential use by many sorts of decision makers, from national policy planners to local communities so that they could integrate them with conservation and development activities affecting the province. The book, in English and Indonesian, starts with a series of short introductions. Chapters follow these on the surveys of plants, aquatic insects, ants, fish, amphibians, birds and mammals. The surveys covered five sites. Not all biologists visited each site. In their chapters most bemoan the lack of time and limitations set by the weather and terrain, being unable to hire local trappers and guides, are frank about the concomitant lack of completeness of their studies, list their findings, discuss new species to be described and conclude that there is a need for further survey work. Nonetheless, this is useful. We are provided with a series of highly informed taxonomic snapshots that together leave no doubt that the area is both biologically fascinating and of high conservation value. Whether this justifies purchase of this book at UK£13.00 is moot; the document is likely to be of better value once it is integrated into a greater whole, perhaps an ‘Ecology of Irian Jaya’, following similar works for other islands of the archipelago. Although biological data were gathered, the usefulness of this information to national and local policy and spatial planners is not clear and raises general doubts about the value of such surveys to conservation planning in South-east Asian and Pacific conservation in general. What was accomplished that makes such surveys priority activities for conservation organizations in Irian Jaya? Conservation International prioritized Irian Jaya as a ‘conservation hotspot’, and whether or not this analytical approach is valid (Jepson & Canney, 2001), Irian Jaya is widely recognized as one of the last great tropical wilderness areas on Earth. Yet its terrestrial environment faces unsustainable forestry practices and rampant illegal logging, land conversion and rapid development. The marine environment is being degraded by over-fishing and coral bombing. Trying to mitigate these threats are a small number of dedicated individuals in NGOs and government. Human resources available locally to encourage better development alternatives with solid recommendations are few, and without back-up, the sorts of area surveyed by this RAP remain threatened with future extirpation. So, what was accomplished beyond the collection of specimens during a one-off, quick survey? What do the contributors of chapters contribute to mitigating the conservation threats their study area will face? Not a lot, apparently. Some examples: whereas, botanically, new species were found ‘the impression obtained walking through this forest was of low species richness, however, this may have been a false impression’. As this author (Ridsdale) noted, plant identification needs fruits and flowers. Collecting in a small area in a one-month time frame can contribute little to understanding an unexplored forest. The aquatic insect chapter notes ‘this high degree of endemism marks the Wapoga system, particularly in its upper reaches, as a notable centre of regional biodiversity’. Yet given how little of Irian Jaya has been explored, how endemic are the endemics? On a landscape to ecoregional scale how notable is the biodiversity centre? Likewise, the fish chapter notes that ‘to date it is the most species-rich system in northern Irian Jaya, but would certainly be surpassed by the much larger Mamberano system once it has been adequately sampled’ and again, throughout the chapters there are calls for further surveys to really understand the diversity of the area. The problem here is not with the biologists doing surveys. These are always important in advancing science in general, and conservation when specific questions are being addressed. The problem is that there was no obvious framework within which this survey was based. The scale of the conservation problems faced by Irian Jaya cannot be met by data from RAPs. The overall summary and recommendations conclude ‘these findings highlight the urgent need for more biological surveys before the protected areas system can be refined or improved’. This is wrong. What biologically rich and under-explored areas that are under severe conservation threat need are actions, now, and not academic displacement behaviour (Whitten et al., 2001). Sumatra and Borneo are almost exhausted, putting Irian Jaya increasingly in the target scopes of undisciplined resource extractors. Waiting for more surveys to somehow provide answers to the region’s problems will be fiddling while Rome burns. Conservation practitioners know that Irian Jaya is valuable. The challenge we all should be taking is to conserve swiftly what we can of what is left. After that, let’s start the fun work of surveys that most of us would rather be doing. It is just that the time for that is not now.

",,,,"Abstract Free‐ranging feral cats ( Felis catus ) are increasingly found in colonies loosely managed by people. These colonies increase cat densities and, hence, pose threats to wildlife via disease and predation, particularly in insular ecosystems where native species have smaller populations and reduced pathogen exposure compared to continental systems. Given such concerns, our objectives were to: (a) identify feral cat colonies on the island of O'ahu in the vicinity of important native bird sites; and (b) test for Toxoplasma gondii , a parasite‐causing disease (Toxoplasmosis) of concern to native birds, at cat colony sites. We identified 32 important native bird locations and surveyed public lands near these sites to determine presence of cat colonies. Where cat colonies were present, we collected feces and used molecular tools to identify the presence of T . gondii . We identified 25 cat colonies near an important bird area and collected feces at four of these colonies, with three testing positive for T . gondii . The presence of cats near a majority of native bird areas suggests that cats may impose a serious threat to bird species. Our finding of T . gondii at three of the four colonies where cat feces were collected raises serious health concerns for humans, birds, and many other terrestrial and aquatic organisms. Native birds in Hawai'i, including highly endangered species, are susceptible to both predation and T . gondii , and finding its presence in locations relatively near to important native bird areas provides further evidence that reducing free‐ranging feral cat numbers is critical for reducing impacts on birds.

Some crows were found in moderately undisturbed limestone forest in Cockpit Country

",,"Wiley
",,,,"Questions
Geographic gradients of beta-diversity help understanding the relationship between species and their environment. However, on a global scale, such patterns are only known for a few taxa, mainly terrestrial vertebrates, especially when considering the phylogenetic dimension. Here, we present the first global analysis of phylogenetic beta-diversity (PBD) for angiosperms. We aim to disentangle the relative contribution of PBD components (turnover- and nestedness-resultant differences) and the deviation of PBD given the taxonomic beta-diversity (TBD) along environmental and geographic gradients.

Location
Global.

Methods
We compiled range maps of 207,146 angiosperm species at 1° cells and calculated PBD for assemblages formed by each focal cell and its neighboring cells in radii of 1.5° and 2° (“moving-window” approach). PBD was decomposed into turnover- and nestedness-resultant components, evaluating their relative importance as the proportion of nestedness-resultant PBD to the total PBD (PBDratio). To evaluate lineage exchanges, we calculated the deviation of PBD from TBD (PBDdev). We assessed the breakpoints of relationship between PBD and geographic (latitude and elevation) and environmental (temperature and precipitation) gradients using linear piecewise regressions.

Results
The turnover-resultant component was predominant in shaping the global angiosperm PBD pattern. PBDratio was positively correlated with temperature, having a breakpoint around 14°. Because PBDdev was mostly positive, TBD prevailed over PBD; PBDdev was correlated significantly with latitude and temperature gradients, being higher (i.e., low lineage replacement compared with species replacement) at latitudes above 50° N, and in colder climates (below 2°C).

Conclusions
We provided the first global assessment of current geographic PBD patterns for angiosperms. Our results showed that such patterns are largely dictated by global environmental and geographic gradients, with lineage replacement being more important than lineage loss in virtually all areas, except at higher latitudes and on islands and peninsulas.","1100-9233

",,"Wiley
",,,,"Threats to a species' persistence are likely to change as conservation measures reduce some threats, while natural and anthropogenic changes increase others. Despite a variety of potential underlying mechanisms, extinction threats will be manifested through one of the 3 components of population dynamics: reducing population growth potential, increasing population variability, or lowering the population ceiling. Consequently, effective management can be guided by monitoring programs and population models that examine each of these components. We examined the potential for a coupled monitoring and modeling effort to guide management of species-at-risk while accounting for evolving risks using the case study of the threatened San Clemente sage sparrow (Amphispiza belli clementeae). Originally listed due to a low population ceiling imposed by severe habitat loss, we found that the major threat to San Clemente sage sparrow persistence has shifted to low population growth potential driven by high juvenile mortality. We further found that successful mitigation of high juvenile mortality will shift the primary threat to drought frequency, which is predicted to increase on San Clemente Island as a consequence of global climate change. The latter shift is a consequence of the boom-bust ecology exhibited by San Clemente sage sparrows in response to rainfall—likely a common characteristic of short-lived terrestrial vertebrates in arid environments. Our ability to successfully recover this species hinges on a comprehensive monitoring and modeling program incorporating all 3 components of population dynamics informing changes in management priorities to reflect shifting threats. Our study indicates that the next critical step to recovering sage sparrows is to understand and mitigate the causes of high juvenile mortality. In response to these predictions, the United States Navy has funded a radio-telemetry study to determine the cause(s) of juvenile mortalities. © 2011 The Wildlife Society.","0022-541X

",,"Wiley
",,,,"Abstract Scrub vegetation is a valuable habitat and resource for wildlife, but if unmanaged can encroach and dominate adjacent habitats, reducing biodiversity value. A primary task in the management of terrestrial nature reserves in the UK is monitoring and controlling scrub. The methods used to monitor and assess scrub cover are often basic, relying on qualitative assessment. Inaccurate assessments may fail to inform appropriate management of the habitats and lead to loss or degradation of important ecological features. Scrub can be monitored using UAV or satellite‐derived imagery, but it can be difficult to distinguish between other vegetation types without using high‐cost hyperspectral sensors. An alternative method using high‐resolution surface models from photogrammetric point clouds enables the isolation of vegetation types based on height. Scrub can be isolated from woodland, hedgerows, and tall ground vegetation. In this study, we calculate scrub cover using a photogrammetric point cloud modeling approach using UAVs. We illustrate the method with two case studies from the UK. The scrub cover at Daneway Banks, a calcareous grassland site in Gloucestershire, was calculated at 21.8% of the site. The scrub cover at Flat Holm Island, a maritime grassland in the Severn Estuary, was calculated at 7%. This approach enabled the scrub layer to be readily measured and if required, modeled to provide a visual guide of what a projected management objective would look like. This approach provides a new tool in reserve management, enabling habitat management strategies to be informed, and progress toward objectives monitored.

",,,,,,"Domestic cats have been introduced to many of the world’s islands where they have been particularly devastating to insular wildlife which, in most cases, evolved in the absence of terrestrial predatory mammals and feline diseases. We review the effects of predation, feline diseases, and the life history characteristics of feral cats and their prey that have contributed to the extirpation and extinction of many insular vertebrate species. The protozoan Toxoplasma gondii is a persistent landbased zoonotic pathogen hosted by cats that is known to cause mortality in several insular bird species. It also enters marine environments in cat feces, where it can cause the mortality of marine mammals. Feral cats remain widespread on islands throughout the world, and are frequently subsidized in colonies which caretakers often assert have little negative effect on native wildlife. However, population genetics, home range, and movement studies all suggest that there are no locations on smaller islands where these cats cannot penetrate within two generations. While the details of past vertebrate extinctions were rarely documented during contemporary time, a strong line of evidence is emerging that the removal of feral cats from islands can rapidly facilitate the recolonization of extirpated species, particularly seabirds. Islands offer unique, mostly self-contained ecosystems in which to conduct controlled studies of the effects of feral cats on wildlife, having implications for continental systems. The response of terrestrial wildlife such as passerine birds, small mammals, and herptiles still needs more thorough long-term monitoring and documentation after the removal of feral cats.

",,,,"Background House mice ( Mus musculus ) are widespread and invasive on many islands where they can have both direct and indirect impacts on native ecological communities. Given their opportunistic, omnivorous nature the consumptive and competitive impacts of house mice on islands have the potential to vary over time in concert with resource availability and mouse population dynamics. Methods We examined the ecological niche of invasive house mice on Southeast Farallon Island, California, USA using a combination of mouse trapping, food resource surveys, and stable isotope analysis to better understand their trophic interactions with native flora and fauna. Specifically, we coupled the analysis of seasonal variation in resource availability over a 17-year period (2001–2017), carbon ( δ 13 C) and nitrogen ( δ 15 N) stable isotope values of mouse tissue and prey resources in a single year (2013), and isotopic niche and mixing models to quantify seasonal variation in mouse diets and the potential for resource overlap with native species. Results We found that plants were the most important resource for house mice during the spring months when vegetation is abundant and mouse populations are low following heavy precipitation and declines in mouse abundance during the winter. While still consumed, plants declined in dietary importance throughout the summer and fall as mouse populations increased, and seabird and arthropod resources became relatively more available and consumed by house mice. Mouse abundance peaks and other resource availability are low on the island in the fall months when the isotopic niches of house mice and salamanders overlap significantly indicating the potential for competition, most likely for arthropod prey. Discussion Our results indicate how seasonal shifts in both mouse abundance and resource availability are key factors that mediate the consumptive and competitive impacts of introduced house mice on this island ecosystem. As mice consume and/or compete with a wide range of native taxa, eradication has the potential to provide wide-reaching restoration benefits on Southeast Farallon Island. Post-eradication monitoring focused on plant, terrestrial invertebrate, salamander, and seabird populations will be crucial to confirm these predictions.

",,,,"The pine marten, Martes martes, is a medium-sized terrestrial carnivore associated with woodland habitats of the western Palearctic region. The present distribution area of the species also includes six islands of the western Mediterranean basin. The origin of these insular populations and their taxonomic status are still debated; their molecular characterization appears relevant for conservation purposes. To describe the genetic variability of the pine martens from Sardinia we characterized 40 insular and 14 Italian individuals at seven nuclear microsatellite loci. The identification of private alleles and the calculated FST value of 0.074 revealed some genetic differentiation between the two populations, which accounts for the high percentages of correct allocation (96.39–98.80%) scored by the genotype assignment test. The presence of two distinct clusters corresponding to Sardinia and mainland Italy was further confirmed by the multivariate Factorial Correspondence Analysis of individual genotypes. Moreover, the genome of the Sardinian individuals bore signs of past demographic fluctuations, i.e. the presence of the monomorphic locus Ma-4, a lower allelic richness and a lower number of private alleles, which may derive from the combination of drift, founder effects, and human overexploitation. Anyway, if such events ever affected the Sardinian population, this is likely to have happened in the past since, according to our microsatellite data, the present-day population does not show evidence of recent bottlenecks or inbreeding, the Wilcoxon sign-rank test and the FIS index being not statistically significant (both P > 0.05). Based on this genetic evidence, we advance hypotheses about the distinctiveness of the Sardinian population and its significance for taxonomy and conservation.","0289-0003

This paper, based on historical testimonies, previously published floristic studies, and an extensive plant inventory conducted during the “International Scientific Expedition PASSION 2015”, show that the atoll has experienced particularly active and rapid vegetation dynamics with alternating plant cover expansion and regression phases. Our results provide the first comprehensive assessment of vegetation cover and vascular plant species distribution based on georeferenced data and mapped with GIS software, as well as the first record of two newly established non-native weeds. The current composition and abundance of native and alien vascular plant communities (15 species including only 4 native taxa) appear to depend not only on abiotic factors (e.g. substrate and climatic events) but also on biotic interactions with animal communities (e.g. native seabirds and crabs). Anthropogenic activities and disturbances (e.g. coconut palm, pig, rat and weed introductions) that have occurred in the past 100 years have also played an important role in explaining the past and current floristic changes.

This article shows how rich shore-zone morphological metrics can be derived from LIDAR terrain models and evaluates the application of LIDAR to classify shore-zone substrates. The utility of LIDAR methods was tested in comparison with the current best-practice method of photo interpretation (i.e. the BC ShoreZone system) on Calvert Island, British Columbia, Canada. Wider applications are considered. Indicators of shore-zone morphology (i.e. slope, width, roughness, backshore elevation) were calculated from LIDAR terrain models for regularly spaced transects perpendicular to the coastline. A combination of boosted regression-tree modeling and direct-rule application was used to classify the shore-zone morphology according to the British Columbia (BC) ShoreZone system. Classification accuracy was assessed against existing ShoreZone classification data. Shore-zone substrate was classified from LIDAR-derived morphometric indicators with 90% accuracy (five classes). A full classification, which combined substrate with shore width and slope, results in lower correspondence (40%; 25 classes) when compared with ShoreZone classes. Differences can likely be attributed, in part, to variation in spatial resolution of elevation-based methods and photo interpretation. It is concluded that LIDAR data can be used to support characterization of shore-zone morphology. Differences in processing and interpretation cause a low direct correspondence with the current image-based classification system, but LIDAR has the advantage of higher resolution, rich terrain information, speed, and an objective and repeatable method for monitoring future change in coastal environments.","0749-0208

Terrestrial invertebrates are very responsive to environmental changes, and native terrestrial invertebrates from cold islands tend to be naive to novel predators. Therefore, understanding the relationships between predators and prey in the context of global changes is essential for the management of these areas, particularly in the case of non-native predators. Merizodus soledadinus (Guérin-Méneville, 1830) is an invasive non-native insect species present on two subantarctic archipelagos, where it has extensive distribution and increasing impacts. While the biology of M. soledadinus has recently received attention, its trophic interactions have been less examined. We investigated how characteristics of M. soledadinus, its density, as well as prey density influence its predation rate on the Kerguelen Islands where the temporal evolution of its geographic distribution is precisely known. Our results show that M. soledadinus can have high ecological impacts on insect communities when present in high densities regardless of its residence time, consistent with the observed decline of the native fauna of the Kerguelen Islands in other studies. Special attention should be paid to limiting factors enhancing its dispersal and improving biosecurity for invasive insect species.

",,,,"Domestic sheep have been introduced to numerous islands worldwide; they became feral and caused indiscriminate impacts on ecosystems. On Socorro, a tropical Mexican island in the Pacific Ocean, feral sheep caused soil compaction and erosion, loss of vegetation, habitat destruction, landscape alterations, and species extinction. In response to these biodiversity threats, feral sheep were removed from Socorro Island. In 2009, 1257 sheep were dispatched using aerial hunting over 35 hours of flight time. To locate remaining herds, twelve sheep were captured and equipped with radio-collars (Judas sheep). From March 2010 to April 2012 eradication continued using terrestrial hunting; 505 sheep were dispatched at this stage. The use of Judas sheep and detection dogs were critical in locating the last remaining sheep. A systematic monitoring program conducted during two years confirmed eradication success. In June 2014, Socorro Island was declared free of feral sheep. To date (November 2015), a remarkable ecosystem recovery has been recorded.","0378-1844

",,,,"Rabbits are considered by biologists to be among the worst invasive species. Their impact on invaded ecosystems, epitomized in Australia and on islands worldwide (e.g. North, Bullock & Dulloo, 1994; Williams et al., 1995; Burbidge & Moris, 2001; Garzon-Machado et al., 2010), has earned them a well-deserved place in the infamous Invasive Species Specialist Group's ‘100 of the Worst Invasive Alien Species’ list. Rabbits are capable of profoundly altering communities, ecosystems and landscapes by sapping biodiversity and biomass from the basic trophic levels of often fragile ecosystems. However, they also have more complex, and hitherto seldom documented effects on higher trophic levels (Zedler & Black, 1992; Priddel, Carlile & Wheeler, 2000; Oliver, Luque-Larena & Lambin, 2009; Denyer, Hartley & John, 2010). In the context of a few, but loud voices attempting to question the importance of alien invasive species (but see Lambertini et al., 2011; Lockwood, Hoopes & Marchetti, 2011), the paper by Brodier et al. (2011) is well timed. It reminds us that restoration ecology and the fight against biodiversity loss are possible, in particular on islands, as they generally have many endemic and threatened species. This paper also highlights two very important, yet previously overlooked points. The first is the importance of long-term follow-up after restoration programmes. The second is the need to consider the indirect (and consequently often hidden) effects that alien invasive species can have on seemingly unconnected species. By monitoring the populations, several petrel species and their avian predator (the brown skua, Catharacta skua) following the removal of rabbits, Brodier et al. (2011) show that rabbits compete for space with blue petrels, Halobaena caerulea. Following rabbit eradication, the competition for burrows was removed and the blue petrel population increased up to eightfold in a few generations. Brown skua also increased their survivorship in response to the increase in its main prey, the blue petrel. Interestingly, the population of another petrel, the Antarctic prion, Pachyptila desolata, was also impacted by the rabbits. Following the eradication, the Antarctic prion population declined fourfold (to exclusion) in areas of deep soil and remained stable where the soil was too shallow for blue petrel (and rabbits). The resulting system, illustrated in Fig. 1, shows that one unexpected, and up to now unreported, effect of rabbits was to erode the niche partitioning of nesting seabirds on the island. Removing the rabbits led to both a competitor release (of the blue petrel, freed from the competition with rabbits) and to an apparent competitor release (of the shared predator, the brown skua, boosted by increased blue petrel availability). The combination of direct and indirect interactions restricted Antarctic prions to shallow soil areas, less favoured by the blue petrel. Schematization of the main relationships among the major vertebrate components of an insular ecosystem with (a) and without (b) introduced rabbits. Blue arrows are for competition, red arrows for predation and purple arrows for apparent competition. The size of the arrow is an indication of the strength of the interaction. This neat system shows how alien invasive species can have effects beyond the trophic level constituting their resources. The contrast between the spectacular recovery of the blue petrel, the increased survival but stable number of skua breeding pairs and the decrease of the Antarctic prion also illustrates well the difficulties to forecast outcomes that conservation program may face even in relatively simple trophic webs. This is especially so in the current context of global climate change, which already affects subantarctic islands (Chapuis, Frenot & Lebouvier, 2004; Dowding et al., 2009), and which could have played a role in the system, for example, in the delayed recovery of the skua. Monitoring population densities, survival and predator diet, every year, on this remote, far reaching island, for long after the rabbit eradication might have been seen as a risky bet. As it turned out, the bet paid off, in the best currency ever: knowledge and understanding. Deciphering the indirect effects a terrestrial herbivore can have on a community of seabirds with which they have few interactions if any, is crucial in our battle against alien invasive species (Bergstrom et al., 2009; Genovesi, 2011). It demonstrates very well that if we were to ‘judge alien species only on their effects’, we would miss all but the tip of the iceberg and would allow important but unapparent, indirect effects of alien invasive species on native ecosystems. One regret from this study is that the monitoring effort conducted after rabbit eradication was not also implemented for a few years before the eradication. This would have allowed a robust comparison of the situation prior to and following rabbit eradication, giving important information on the complexity of their effect on the invaded community. For example, knowing quantitatively the composition of skua diet would likely have strengthen the demonstration that rabbits did not boost the skua population by providing a surplus of prey (e.g. hyperpredation; Roemer, Donlan & Courchamp, 2002). Such pre-eradication studies are key to success, especially as most islands are generally large, more complex and multi-invaded, with a guild of introduced competitors, mesopredators and top predators. Assessing the precise place of the alien species in the invaded trophic web, although long advocated (Zavaleta, Hobbs & Mooney, 2001; Courchamp, Chapuis & Pascal, 2003), is unfortunately seldom a luxury that funding agencies will grant, or that invaded ecosystem can afford (Simberloff, 2003). Yet, it is an approach that may help implement the most efficient restoration programs, prevent surprise effects (Caut, Angulo & Courchamp, 2009; Bonnaud et al., 2010) and generate further understanding on trophic web dynamics, and beyond that on ecosystem functioning.

",,,,"Abstract Monitoring is critical to assess management effectiveness, but broadscale systematic assessments of monitoring to evaluate and improve recovery efforts are lacking. We compiled 1808 time series from 71 threatened and near‐threatened terrestrial and volant mammal species and subspecies in Australia (48% of all threatened mammal taxa) to compare relative trends of populations subject to different management strategies. We adapted the Living Planet Index to develop the Threatened Species Index for Australian Mammals and track aggregate trends for all sampled threatened mammal populations and for small (&lt;35 g), medium (35–5500 g), and large mammals (&gt;5500 g) from 2000 to 2017. Unmanaged populations (42 taxa) declined by 63% on average; unmanaged small mammals exhibited the greatest declines (96%). Populations of 17 taxa in havens (islands and fenced areas that excluded or eliminated introduced red foxes [ Vulpes vulpes ] and domestic cats [ Felis catus ]) increased by 680%. Outside havens, populations undergoing sustained predator baiting initially declined by 75% but subsequently increased to 47% of their abundance in 2000. At sites where predators were not excluded or baited but other actions (e.g., fire management, introduced herbivore control) occurred, populations of small and medium mammals declined faster, but large mammals declined more slowly, than unmanaged populations. Only 13% of taxa had data for both unmanaged and managed populations; index comparisons for this subset showed that taxa with populations increasing inside havens declined outside havens but taxa with populations subject to predator baiting outside havens declined more slowly than populations with no management and then increased, whereas unmanaged populations continued to decline. More comprehensive and improved monitoring (particularly encompassing poorly represented management actions and taxonomic groups like bats and small mammals) is required to understand whether and where management has worked. Improved implementation of management for threats other than predation is critical to recover Australia's threatened mammals.

",,,,"The placement of Leptusa chiltoni is restored to its original status as sole member of the genus Baeostethus. Baeostethus chiltoni is a subantarctic intertidal species that is present on the shores of Auckland, Antipodes, and Campbell islands. Baeostethus is concluded to be a member of Liparocephalini based on the absence of seta v on the adult mentum, several setae distributed only on the mesal surface and apex of the galea, and contiguous mesocoxal cavities. The phylogenetic relationships of Liparocephalini are investigated in the context of a previous study and Baeostethus is shown to be a sister taxon to Liparocephalus based on 12 synapomorphies (nine are unique). The majority of Liparocephalini are distributed along the coasts of the northern Pacific rim, some 9000 km away from B. chiltoni. Most are apterous, and with Baeostethus as a relatively derived member of the group, it is difficult to reconcile the biogeographic pattern based on a dispersal event from the northern Pacific to the Campbell Plateau. We argue that the trans‐Pacific pattern in Liparocephalini is due to an older contiguous distribution along the coastal margins of Pangea. The data are supported by an alternative area cladogram derived from a rerooted tree, congruence with a Pacific rim pattern seen in intertidal Aegalitinae (Salpingidae), and the distribution and phylogeny of terrestrial Gymnusini (Aleocharinae).

On Sand Island of Kuaihelani, mice recently began to depredate nesting adult mōlī (Laysan Albatross, Phoebastria immutabilis ). Efforts are underway to eradicate mice from Sand Island, but knowledge of mouse diet is needed to predict ecosystem response and recovery following mouse removal. We used next-generation sequencing to identify what mice eat on Sand Island, followed by stable isotope analysis to estimate the proportions contributed by taxa to mouse diet. We collected paired fecal and hair samples from 318 mice between April 2018 to May 2019; mice were trapped approximately every eight weeks among four distinct habitat types to provide insight into temporal and spatial variation. Sand Island’s mice mainly consume arthropods, with nearly equal (but substantially smaller) contributions of C 3 plants, C 4 plants, and mōlī. Although seabird tissue is a small portion of mouse diet, mice consume many detrital-feeding arthropods in and around seabird carcasses, such as isopods, flesh flies, ants, and cockroaches. Additionally, most arthropods and plants eaten by mice are non-native. Mouse diet composition differs among habitat types but changes minimally throughout the year, indicating that mice are not necessarily limited by food source availability or accessibility. Eradication of house mice may benefit seabirds on Sand Island (by removing a terrestrial, non-native predator), but it is unclear how arthropod and plant communities may respond and change. Non-native and invasive arthropods and plants previously consumed (and possibly suppressed) by mice may be released post-eradication, which could prevent recovery of native taxa. Comprehensive knowledge of target species’ diet is a critical component of eradication planning. Dietary information should be used both to identify and to monitor which taxa may respond most strongly to invasive species removal and to assess if proactive, pre-eradication management activities are warranted.

This paper presents novel applications of the MAES procedure in the EU Outermost Regions and Overseas Countries and Territories (""EU Overseas""). Eight case studies from different geographical areas were analysed through a comparative assessment by applying an established framework following key steps in the MAES process, in order to stipulate lessons learned and recommendations for MAES in the EU Overseas. These key steps include the identification of policy questions, stakeholder networks and involvement, application of MAES methods, dissemination and communication and implementation. The case studies were conducted and analysed under the umbrella of the EU MOVE pilot project, including the Azores, the Canary Islands, Saint Martin, French Guiana, Martinique, Reunion Island and the Falkland Islands. Each case study represented different governance, policy and decision-making frameworks towards biodiversity and environmental protection. Case studies predominantly addressed the policy domains of Nature and Biodiversity Conservation and Marine and Maritime Policy. Ecosystem Services (ES) were assessed across a wide range of themes, biomes and scales, focusing on terrestrial, coastal and marine ecosystems. Results show that the implementation of the case studies was accompanied by extensive communication and dissemination activities. First success stories were visible, where the MAES exercise led to meaningful uptake of the ES concept to policies and decision-making. Yet, there is still work to be done - major bottlenecks were identified related to the MAES implementation centring around financial resources, training and technical expertise. Addressing these aspects can contribute to an enhanced implementation of MAES in the EU Overseas in the future.

We found that the micrometazoans inhabiting the algae consist of remarkably abundant bdelloid rotifers (subclass Bdelloidea), followed by tardigrades. We did not find nematodes. The rotifer assemblages were characterized by low diversity (only six species). Nevertheless, rotifer densities were extremely high: mean densities ranged from 75 to 3030 individuals per 100 mg of the dry sample weight and the maximum value numbered in excess of 8000 per 100 mg of the dry sample weight. These data show that terrestrial algae, along with mosses, are a very attractive habitat for rotifers and tardigrades in the Antarctic. The statistical analysis showed a lack of correlations between rotifer and tardigrade densities and nutrients (N, C, P, K and Na). Our findings are consistent with the patchy distribution of terrestrial micrometazoans in the Antarctic that has previously been found.

",,,,"Addressed here is the biogeographical-vexing question of why the guanaco (Lama guanicoe) is the only large mammal on the big island of Tierra del Fuego, answered by comparing alternative colonisation hypotheses. A multidisciplinary examination was conducted into the archaeological, ecological, evolutionary, geographical, genomic, glacial and zoological past, plus distribution of native terrestrial vertebrates in the Patagonia of southern South America. Notable disparities exist between main Patagonia (2.5 species/10,000 km2) compared with Tierra del Fuego (1.8). In the similar-sized area of mainland Patagonia just north of the Strait of Magellan there are 12 reptiles, 7 amphibians and 34 mammals = 53 total species; Tierra del Fuego has 13. Despite being the size of Switzerland and only 3.1 km from the mainland, Tierra del Fuego has no species of snakes, salamanders, frogs or turtles, only one lizard, one toad, nine small mammals, one carnivore and one ungulate, the Guanaco. An innovative proposal is made contrary to traditional thinking: Tierra del Fuego has relatively few native-terrestrial vertebrates because they were decimated by major tephra-ash fallout (2 to >15 cm) from the Holocene 7750 YBP (years before present) Hudson volcano, the biggest and most destructive eruption in Patagonia during the past 10,000 years that eradicated indigenous peoples, most terrestrial vertebrates and all Guanacos. Neither terrestrial vertebrates nor man were replenished from the adjacent mainland for 1000 years because the Strait of Magellan was a complete biogeographical barrier. Guanacos on Tierra del Fuego have lower genetic diversity compared with the mainland, suggesting it is a younger population. Empirical evidence and pivotal events of Patagonia's prehistory support one of three hypotheses: guanacos were introduced to Tierra del Fuego by early Holocene, guanaco-dependent, indigenous peoples from the mainland who repopulated Tierra del Fuego utilising the newly invented, skilfully crafted, seaworthy bark canoe (Appendix S1–Resumen en Español).","2054-4049

",,,,"Limited gene flow between populations due to geographic distance, presence of barriers or inherent low dispersal ability leads to the formation of genetically structured populations. Strong population structure indicates lowered levels or absence of gene flow which might lead to inbreeding and loss of genetic capacity to recuperate from anthropogenic stress and natural calamities. Terrestrial reptiles are generally known to have low dispersal abilities and few studies have explored drivers of their population structure on continental islands, where both anthropogenic stress and natural calamities are relatively common. We investigated the population structure and drivers of diversification of the Andaman keelback (Xenochrophis tytleri), an endemic, terrestrial and freshwater snake species in the Andaman archipelago, a continental group of islands in the Bay of Bengal. Data was collected from 86 individuals from seven islands and 78 individuals were sequenced for the gene Nuclear Dehydrogenase subunit 4 to identify the number of populations and distribution of genetic diversity across populations. We found 11 haplotypes on seven islands and observed high genetic differentiation between seven populations defined island-wise (FST = 0.82). We further tested the number of populations by incorporating spatial data into Bayesian Clustering Analysis (GENELAND) and identified six populations of the Andaman keelback. We tested for the influence of Isolation-by-distance on these populations. While the overall trend showed a positive correlation between geographic and genetic distance, a correlogram revealed that the positive correlation disappears beyond ∼20-40 km. We also tested for the presence of geographical barriers to gene flow using Monmonier's algorithm (SPADS), which identified five barriers to dispersal confirming that there are oceanic barriers to dispersal for some island populations of the Andaman keelback. As the Andaman Islands are arranged almost in a straight line from North to South, our data are insufficient to tease apart the roles of geographical distance and barriers to gene flow. We conclude that salt waters between near islands are weak barriers and as the geographical distance between islands increases, so does the strength of the barrier.

We compare climatic definitions of tropical dry forest (Murphy and Lugo, FAO, Dryflor, Aridity Index) using Worldclim, CHELSA, and Global Aridity and PET climatic datasets (1 km) and compare results to the World Wildlife Fund’s Terrestrial Ecoregions (Tropical and Subtropical Dry Broadleaf Forest), as well as 579 field plots identified as tropical dry forest. Understanding the best method to estimate global tropical dry forest extent gives both researchers and policy makers a vital tool to begin protecting this critically endangered and valuable resource. We identify methods that most accurately predicted tropical dry forest extent.  The global extents of tropical dry forest regions varied significantly with the Aridity Index predicting the largest extent, Murphy and Lugo and FAO predicting similar extents, and DryFlor predicting the smallest extent regardless of climatic dataset used. Globally, there was low agreement between climatic definitions and WWF Ecoregions. FAO and the Aridity Index climate definitions had the highest agreement with WWF Tropical and Subtropical Dry Broadleaf Forest Ecoregions (57%) while FAO (76%) and Murphy and Lugo (69%) definitions had the highest agreement with field plots. However, extents and accuracy varied significantly by regions, biodiversity hotspots, and island archipelagos. Tropical dry forest region extent varies significantly based on climatic definition but not climatic datasets at a global spatial scale. Nearly half of all tropical dry forests will be missed when only analyzing WWF Ecoregion boundaries and climatic definitions will be needed to estimate dry forest cover and change. There was high heterogeneity among climatic definitions at a regional and local spatial scale suggesting that climate definition can only provide a first order hypothesis about the distribution of dry forests and data on phenology, forest structure, and composition are still needed to compare local tropical dry forest extent.",,,,,,,,,,,,No,,includes islands,,struct,,,0.7506159745156765,1,0.3683346648232299,0.8,4,814.0

In 97 transects positioned randomly across the island, we found nine invasive herb and shrub species were present in all human-modified habitats but not in intact forest interiors. In separate forest-specific transects, we documented a sharp drop in the abundance of invasive plants &gt;5 m into the forest. High numbers of invasive plant seeds germinated from the soil seed bank sampled at the forest edge, but very few seeds germinated from soil sampled any distance into the forest. Finally, in experiments with four focal invasive plant species, overall germination rates were low; and much lower in shaded sites compared to full gap sites. In conclusion, our findings demonstrated that invasive herbs and shrubs do not yet form a serious threat to native species in the closed-canopy forests of Hainan.

",,,,"Abstract Aim The diversity and distribution of soil microorganisms and their potential for long‐distance dispersal (LDD) are poorly documented, making the threats posed by climate change difficult to assess. If microorganisms do not disperse globally, regional endemism may develop and extinction may occur due to environmental changes. Here, we addressed this question using the testate amoeba Apodera vas , a morphologically conspicuous model soil microorganism in microbial biogeography, commonly found in peatlands and forests mainly of former Gondwana. We first documented its distribution. We next assessed whether its distribution could be explained by dispersal (i.e. matching its climatic niche) or vicariance (i.e. palaeogeography), based on the magnitude of potential range expansions or contractions in response to past and on‐going climatic changes. Last, we wanted to assess the likelihood of cryptic diversity and its potential threat from climate and land‐use changes (e.g. due to limited LDD). Location Documented records: Southern Hemisphere and intertropical zone; modelling: Global. Methods We first built an updated global distribution map of A. vas using 401 validated georeferenced records. We next used these data to develop a climatic niche model to predict its past (LGM, i.e. 21 ± 3 ka BP; PMIP3 IPSL‐CM5A‐LR), present and future (IPSL‐CMP6A‐LR predictions for 2071–2100, SSP3 and 5) potential distributions in responses to climate, by relating the species occurrences to climatic and topographic predictors. We then used these predictions to test our hypotheses (dispersal/vicariance, cryptic diversity, future threat from LDD limitation). Results Our models show that favourable climatic conditions for A. vas currently exist in the British Isles, an especially well‐studied region for testate amoebae where this species has never been found. This demonstrates a lack of interhemispheric LDD, congruent with the palaeogeography (vicariance) hypothesis. Longitudinal LDD is, however, confirmed by the presence of A. vas in isolated and geologically young peri‐Antarctic islands. Potential distribution maps for past, current and future climates show favourable climatic conditions existing on parts of all southern continents, with shifts to higher land from LGM to current in the tropics and a strong range contraction from current to future (global warming IPSL‐CM6A‐LR scenario for 2071–2100, SSP3.70 and SSP5.85) with favourable conditions developing on the Antarctic Peninsula. Main Conclusions This study illustrates the value of climate niche models for research on microbial diversity and biogeography, along with exploring the role played by historical factors and dispersal limitation in shaping microbial biogeography. We assess the discrepancy between latitudinal and longitudinal LDD for A. vas , which is possibly due to contrast in wind patterns and/or likelihood of transport by birds. Our models also suggest that climate change may lead to regional extinction of terrestrial microscopic organisms, thus illustrating the pertinence of including microorganisms in biodiversity conservation research and actions.

",,,,"We performed the first survey of terrestrial gastropods on Dåno′ (Cocos Island). Dåno′ is a 0.33 km2 uninhabited atoll island located 2.5 km southwest of Guam, the largest island in the Mariana archipelago, western Micronesia. In 4 days of examining vegetation, soil, and leaf litter, we found 14 species of mollusks arrayed in 12 genera and 11 taxonomic families. The fauna is a subset of that found on Guam. Five species are native to the Mariana Islands, two of which are endemic to the archipelago, and the remaining seven are likely introduced there, perhaps prehistorically. Ground-inhabiting species found only as abundant worn shells in soil suggest relatively recent turnover of these forms, perhaps from seawater inundation of the low-lying island during typhoons. There was no evidence of Mariana endemic snails in the family Partulidae, recently afforded legal protection under the U.S. Endangered Species Act. However, neither did we encounter the invasive flatworm Platydemus manokwari De Beauchamp, currently decimating partulids elsewhere in the Marianas. Hence, we suggest that if further surveys confirm the predator's absence, Dåno′ might serve as a novel sanctuary for transplanted populations of Guam's most endangered snails.","0030-8870

To effectively manage this bat species with an archipelago-wide distribution, it is important to determine the population size on each island and connectivity between islands. We used 18 nuclear microsatellite loci and one mitochondrial gene from 339 individuals collected from 1988–2020 to evaluate genetic diversity, population structure and estimate effective population size on the Islands of Hawaiʻi, Maui, Oʻahu, and Kauaʻi. Genetic differentiation occurred between Hawaiʻi and Maui, both of which were differentiated from Oʻahu and Kauaʻi. The population on Maui presents the greatest per-island genetic diversity, consistent with their hypothesized status as the original founding population. A signature of isolation by distance was detected between islands, with contemporary migration analyses indicating limited gene flow in recent generations, and male-biased sex dispersal within Maui. Historical and long-term estimates of genetic effective population sizes were generally larger than contemporary estimates, although estimates of contemporary genetic effective population size lacked upper bounds in confidence intervals for Hawaiʻi and Kauaʻi. Contemporary genetic effective population sizes were smaller on Oʻahu and Maui. We also detected evidence of past bottlenecks on all islands with the exception of Hawaiʻi. Our study provides population-level estimates for the genetic diversity and geographic structure of ‘ōpeʻapeʻa, that could be used by agencies tasked with wildlife conservation in Hawaiʻi.

","Dawes, Thomas; Burns, Kevin",,Epiphyte; Understory; Facultative; Temperate rainforest,,,2020.0,,,1100,1111,,,,,,31,6,"Journal of Vegetation Science
",,"Wiley
",,,,"Aims
Shade-tolerant tree species often produce larger seeds with greater energetic resources to cope with light limitation. On the other hand, shade-intolerant species often produce smaller seeds with greater dispersal potential to colonise lighter, more disturbed areas of forest. We test the hypothesis that small-seeded species utilise an alternative recruitment strategy in a southern temperate rainforest by establishing epiphytically on the trunks of tree ferns.

Location
Wellington region, North Island of New Zealand.

Methods
To assess whether small-seeded tree species rely on tree fern epiphytism for recruitment we quantified relative abundances of both epiphytic and terrestrial subpopulations in 14 woody plant species across a range of seed sizes. We used a paired study design where we surveyed all 3,727 woody plants occurring on 322 tree ferns and in matching forest floor plots of equivalent area. Using a linear model, we then assessed the relationship between species’ seed size and their epiphytic tendency (arboreality).

Results
Arboreality scores differed both between species and between life history stages. Seed size predicted arboreality regardless of life history stage, with small-seeded species more likely to occur arboreally than larger-seeded ones. However, the effect of seed size decreased predictably in later life history stages. Seed size also predicted arboreality when the model was rerun using subsets of data restricted to common understorey tree ferns.

Conclusion
Interspecific differences in the epiphytic establishment of New Zealand tree species are pronounced, with only smaller-seeded species able to use this regeneration niche. Small-seeded species, especially Weinmannia racemosa, appear to be utilising an alternative recruitment strategy by establishing epiphytically on tree fern trunks.","1100-9233

However, it is still a challenge to make these measures meaningful for assessing the impacts of environmental perturbation. Here, we integrate an optical remote sensing system termed EcoiRS (Ecosystem observation by an integrated Remote Sensing system) specifically for this purpose. EcoiRS consists of three subsystems: an off-the-shelf atmospheric correction model (ACORN), a cloud/shadow removal model, and an advanced spectral mixture analysis model (AutoMCU). The core of ACORN is a set of radiative transfer codes that can be used to remove the effects of molecular/aerosol scatterings and water vapor absorption from remotely sensed data, and to convert these digital signals to surface reflectance. Shadow and cloud cover that would obscure the reflective properties of land surfaces in an image can be minimized by referring to their optical and thermal spectral profiles. AutoMCU executes iterative unmixing for each pixel using selected spectral endmembers based upon the rule of Monte Carlo simulation. The main outcomes of EcoiRS include cover fractions of green vegetation, non-photosynthetically active vegetation and bare soils, along with uncertainty measures for each pixel. The dynamics of these derived products are significant indicators for monitoring the change of states of terrestrial environments, and they can be used for investigating different environmental perturbations. Here, we demonstrate studies of implementing EcoiRS to map three major but relatively less studied cases in a western Pacific island (Taiwan): typhoons, tree diseases and alien plant invasion","1939-1404

","Wilkinson, David",,Vicariance,,,2003.0,,,1779,1780,,,,,,30,11,"Journal of Biogeography
",,"Wiley
",,,,"Recently in this Journal, Ebach & Humphries (2003) have argued for the primacy of a cladistic approach in biogeographical explanations, downplaying the importance of dispersal. In particular, they treat dispersal as a secondary process rather than an equal to vicariance and cite Brown & Lomolino (1998) and myself (Wilkinson, 2001a) as examples from the current literature that they believe overemphasize the importance of dispersal. They suggest that dispersal biogeographers have ignored the importance of Earth processes such as plate tectonics and they suggest that biogeography suffers from ‘a plethora of methods’ and as such is ‘not seen as a field in its own right’ (Ebach & Humphries, 2003, p. 959). Before addressing their main points, this more general comment about ‘a plethora of methods’ deserves some consideration. Ebach and Humphries appear to believe that there should be a tight definition of biogeography, which clearly differentiates the subject from related disciplines (something they see as currently lacking). From this definition should follow a correct method for approaching these carefully defined biogeographical problems, a method which they see as grounded in cladistics and vicariance. While this is a caricature of their views, resulting from my attempts to describe their main arguments with brevity, like most good caricatures I believe it preserves the key features. Biogeography, however, is just one part of our attempt to understand the Universe, and the classification of this attempt at understanding into multiple disciplines (biogeography, ecology, geology, cosmology, chemistry, etc.) is an artificial one designed for our convenience. Indeed the philosopher Midgley (1989, 2001) has strongly argued that we have impeded our understanding of the world by overemphasizing these unnatural divisions. Biogeography does not need a rigorous definition beyond a general statement that it is about the distribution of organisms in space and time. Indeed such a definition could be harmful by potentially excluding much that is relevant as outside the scope of the subject. It seems to me that complex subjects are likely to yield best to ‘a plethora of methods’ with different methods being more or less suitable to different questions within the general field of enquiry. So a cladistic approach may be useful for some, but by no means all, biogeographical questions. The above argument is nicely illustrated by Ebach and Humphries’ central point that the dynamic view of the Earth, produced by our understanding of plate tectonics, is central to biogeography and dispersal-centred explanations are largely an outdated survivor from a static view of the Earth's continents. This view fails to appreciate that the relative importance of dispersal and vicariance (driven by plate tectonics) differs depending on the biogeographical question under investigation. For example, if I am interested in the biogeography of the tiger Panthera tigris, and if we assume that this species had a point of origin in space–time in the recent geological past, then dispersal will be one of the key relevant mechanisms in understanding its current distribution, with plate tectonics of little importance. However, if I am interested in the distribution of the order Carnivora then plate tectonics becomes more important. The larger the geological time-scale of interest and the higher the taxonomic unit being studied, the more likely it is that vicariance is important. However, most of the studies published by this Journal have time-scales of the Quaternary, or less, and focus on the species level. Here dispersal and extinction are usually more important than vicariance and as such cladistic methods are less useful. At the Quaternary time-scale the most dramatic dynamic aspect of the Earth have been the glacial/interglacial cycles. Fossil evidence suggests that dispersal (along with extinction) has been a key mechanism by which species respond to these changes (Huntley & Webb, 1989; Bennett, 1997). The comments about scale, both taxonomic and temporal, made above apply to the large organisms that dominate most biogeography textbooks (e.g. Brown & Lomolino, 1998; Cox & Moore, 2000) and most papers in this Journal. However, much of the Earth's biodiversity is microbial (Margulis & Schwartz, 1998) and these microbes are crucial to most ecological processes (Wilkinson, 1998; Newman & Banfield, 2002). For these organisms it seems likely that the ease of their dispersal swamps vicariance in importance. It has long been a maxim in microbiology that ‘everything is everywhere, the environment selects’. The idea being that free living microbes are so small and numerous that they can disperse everywhere and unlike larger organisms are only absent from sites because of unsuitable habitats. There is now much evidence in support of this idea (Finlay, 2002), although the largest microbes may be an exception to this general rule (Wilkinson, 2001b). While this view of cosmopolitan microbial biogeography is not universally accepted (e.g. Mann & Droop, 1996; Foissner, 1999) it seems unlikely that the vicariance-inspired cladistic approach will be useful for microbes. The importance of dispersal is illustrated most dramatically by isolated volcanic islands such as Ascension Island and St Helena in the south Atlantic, Christmas Island in the Indian Ocean and Guadalupe in the Pacific (Whittaker, 1998). Without dispersal all these islands would be devoid of terrestrial life! A theoretical base for biogeography that was inapplicable to such fascinating islands would be sadly lacking. In conclusion, for some groups, such as microbes, universal dispersal appears to rule out a significant role for vicariance. For other groups it depends on the question asked (especially the taxonomic and temporal scales). Even at scales that appear ideal for a vicariance-inspired explanation, dispersal can turn out to provide a better answer. For example, recent work on chameleons has concluded that ‘Oceanic dispersal – not Gondwanan break up – facilitated species radiation’ (Raxworthy et al., 2002). Darwin (1859) may have showed great good sense in emphasizing the importance of dispersal, not merely because he did not know about plate tectonics, but because dispersal is a fundamental process in understanding much of biogeography. I thank Jim Brown and Brett Riddle for useful discussions. David Wilkinson has wide interests in biology, environmental science and the history of science. His theoretical work has concentrated on biogeography, evolutionary ecology and the Earth system (Gaia). His more empirical studies have included work on Quaternary palaeoecology, environmental archaeology (especially around the English Lake District) and the ecology of protozoa.

The discovery of a new species of Brasilonema from the Canary Islands related to species initially found on the opposite side of the Atlantic Ocean, and recently in Asia, Europe, and Portugal, raises questions about their dispersal mechanisms, whether through natural means or human-mediated processes, prompting the need for future studies to investigate these propagation patterns. In the case of Rhizonema melkonianarum sp. nov., the transition from adapting to a basidiolichen host to inhabiting the phyllosphere of angiosperms raises ecological and evolutionary adaptation questions regarding cyanobacterial adaptability and their ecological roles in diverse habitats. This research expands our understanding of the diversity and geographic distribution of these terrestrial phyllosphere-associated cyanobacteria.

",,,,"Abstract Widely dispersed fragmented populations are a challenge to monitor because subpopulation sizes may be very small, difficult to access and time consuming to sample regularly. We use the coconut crab ( Birgus latro ) on Pemba, United Republic of Zanzibar as a case study for estimating highly fragmented populations and metapopulation sizes. The species is a very large terrestrial decapod threatened by exploitation and habitat alteration and now classified as vulnerable. We developed an integrated model to analyse capture‐mark‐recapture (CMR) data from five sites jointly with count data from 24 sites to estimate site‐level densities and population sizes, predicted total population size across the Pemba archipelago, and investigated the effect of six predictors of human influence on density. We fitted separate models to test the effect of the same predictors on raw counts and individual body mass. We estimate the total population of coconut crabs on the Pemba archipelago to be c . 6700 terrestrial individuals. We show that government protection generally affects crabs positively, whereas presence of agriculture negatively affects their densities. This study highlights that time‐consuming CMR data can be leveraged to estimate densities on less visited sites, and that fully protected islands are critical for maintaining relatively high population densities. Our overall population estimate suggests that Pemba still hosts a viable coconut crab population in a part of its range where the species is otherwise in steep decline.

",,,,"ABSTRACT Aim We map global patterns of taxonomic and functional change between past (pre‐human impacts) and present (after anthropogenic extinctions and introductions) in large oceanic island bird assemblages and investigate if these patterns can be explained by island characteristics and anthropogenic factors. Location Sixty‐four oceanic islands (&gt;100 km 2 ). Time Period Late Holocene. Major Taxa Studied Terrestrial and freshwater bird species. Methods We compiled information on extinct, extant native and introduced bird species for all islands and used a probabilistic hypervolume approach to build a multi‐dimensional trait space and calculate several functional diversity metrics before and after extinctions and introductions. We identified which islands are global hotspots of human‐induced transformation by mapping multiple facets of biotic change and investigated intrinsic island characteristics and anthropogenic factors as drivers for these observed patterns. Results The Hawaiian and Mascarene islands stand out as hotspots of taxonomic and functional change, but all islands changed taxonomically and functionally, mostly gaining species but losing functional richness. Taxonomic and functional changes vary across islands but are often consistent within the same archipelago. Island isolation and surface can explain some of the observed variations, but anthropogenic factors, namely human occupation, also shaped both taxonomic and functional changes. Islands with higher human pressure, as well as larger islands with high elevation ranges, tended to have greater losses in functional richness. Main Conclusions Most biodiversity change assessments are still largely based exclusively on taxonomic diversity, which is particularly worrying in the case of oceanic islands given that the magnitude of functional diversity change is often considerably larger. We call for comprehensive assessments of changes in both taxonomic and functional diversity across oceanic islands in order to better understand the drivers of these changes and, in turn, predict future trends.

957.0,"Historical Biogeography of Reptiles and Amphibians from the Lesser Sunda Islands of Indonesia
","Reilly, Sean",,Archipelago; New guinea; Land bridge,,,2016.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"The Lesser Sunda Archipelago, also known as Nusa Tenggara, lies in the southeastern portion of Indonesia and extends between Bali in the west, and New Guinea in the east. While the Lesser Sundas themselves are oceanic islands that have never been land bridged to a continent the islands on either side do. Bali and the other Greater Sunda Islands of Java, Sumatra, and Borneo become periodically land bridged with Asia during glacial maxima forming the Sunda Shelf. New Guinea and Aru become periodically land bridged to Australia during glacial maxima and form the Sahul Shelf. Given their current orientation, the Lesser Sundas may act as ‘stepping stones’ for animals and plants dispersing between the Sunda and Sahul Shelves and may act as a two-way filter for organisms dispersing between two of the world’s great biogeographical realms. Alfred Russel Wallace’s discovery of a pattern of clinal mixture of species from different biogeographical realms was a key insight leading to his identification of the Wallace Line and to his creation of the field of biogeography. Even though the Lesser Sundas played a critical role in the development of the field, this region has received little subsequent attention from historical biogeographers and our current understanding of Lesser Sunda biogeography has only modestly improved relative to what was known at the time of Wallace. The reptiles and amphibians of the Lesser Sundas represent a particularly interesting group of vertebrates from a biogeographical standpoint because they appear to show distributional patterns that are most consistent with a stepping-stone model of island colonization caused by the two-way filter zone. In Chapter 1, I review the geological and biogeographical literature for the Lesser Sundas and use these sources to formulate hypotheses concerning the colonization of the archipelago by rafting terrestrial vertebrates. In Chapters 2 through 4, I investigate the possibility that flying lizards, forest skinks, and fanged frogs have colonized the archipelago in a stepping-stone manner using a phylogenomic approach (using sequence data from mtDNA and hundreds of nuclear loci) whereby the relationships among island-specific lineages can be used to infer the sequence of island colonization. Flying lizards of the genus Draco form a monophyletic group that colonized the western Inner Arc islands of Lombok or Sumbawa from the Sunda Shelf around 10 million years ago when Lombok and Sumbawa first became land-positive. Draco continued expanding eastward through the Inner Arc until they reached Lembata, while a series of dispersal events from Flores south to Sumba, east to Timor, north to Wetar, west to Alor, and finally west to Pantar (the island immediately west of Lembata). The islands of Sumbawa and Flores contain multiple non-sister lineages that are parapatrically distributed and are exchanging migrants within an island. Forest Skinks of the genus Sphenomorphus show relatively little morphological divergence across their range yet exhibit large levels of genetic divergence. The oldest lineages of Sphenomorphus within the Lesser Sundas occur on the islands of Lombok and Flores and they expanded eastward through the Inner Arc until they reached Pantar. But rather than reaching Alor from neighboring Pantar, Sphenomorphus dispersed from Flores south to Sumba, then east to Timor, Alor, and Wetar. There are multiple non-sister lineages of Sphenomorphus on Lombok, Flores, and Sumba, and estimates of migration between lineages within each island suggest that these lineages are not interbreeding. Fanged frogs of the genus Limnonectes have colonized the Inner Arc of the Lesser Sundas from the Sunda Shelf. It is possible that Limnonectes kadarsani and L. dammermani diverged in situ on Lombok after which L. kadarsani dispersed east all the way to Lembata. But rather although a tree topology consistent with a stepping-stone pattern of island colonization is suggested by the mtDNA data, the phylogenomic results suggest a leap-frog pattern where Lembata is derived from West Flores, and these two lineages are closer related to Sumbawa than they are to Eastern Flores. The parapatrically distributed lineages on Flores are experiencing asymmetrical gene flow with successful migrants moving from west to east. In summary, the oldest islands of the western Inner Arc tend to harbor the most divergent lineages for all three focal taxa, a pattern expected from lineages originating from the Sunda Shelf. In Draco and Sphenomorphus, the islands of the eastern Inner Banda Arc are colonized by way of the ‘Sumba Route’ where they disperse into the Outer Banda Arc island of Sumba and then move east to Timor, and finally north into the eastern Inner Arc. All three focal taxa show multiple non-sister lineages on some of the larger islands, suggesting either that multiple colonization events of a single island occurred, or possibly that formerly separated paleo-islands have since merged allowing for secondary contact of lineages that diverged in allopatry. These studies have shown that the biogeography of reptiles and amphibians within the Lesser Sundas is extremely complex. By examining biogeographical patterns across many co-distributed taxa these studies have the potential to provide insights into the geological history of the archipelago. From an evolutionary perspective, these studies highlight the presence of multiple independently evolving lineages within a currently described species occurring on the same island, which suggests that species diversity within reptiles and amphibians of the Lesser Sundas is underestimated.",,,,,,,,,,,,No,,,,"gen, trait",,,0.996406638622284,1,0.0008632719355224504,1.0,5,121.0

",,,,"The Atlantic Islands of Galicia Maritime/Terrestrial National Park hosts one of the largest breeding colonies of yellow-legged gull (Larus michahellis) in the world. In 2002, a new yellow-legged gull breeding colony was established on the Punta Muxieiro dune complex, which also harbors rare and threatened plant species and habitat types of community interest according to Directive 92/43/EEC. This study assesses the effect of this colony on two habitats of community interest: white dunes and grey dunes. For this purpose, plant cover and soil properties, composition, and nutrient content were monitored in plots with different gull densities. Moreover, historic aerial images were compiled to observe changes in the plant landscape of the dune system. The results showed that, despite the recentness of the occupation of the dune system by yellow-legged gull species, significant changes in acidic–alkaline processes and nutrient availability were already observed in soils. Soils in plots with higher gull density showed more acidic pH values and a higher content of the most labile N and P fractions. Moreover, a decrease in plant cover and number of species was also demonstrated in plots with higher gull densities. Finally, the presence of ruderal and alien species such as Urtica membranacea and Parietaria judaica was also observed.

",,,,"Colonial-nesting organisms can strongly alter the chemical and biotic conditions around their aggregation sites, with cascading impacts on other components of the ecosystem. In tropical Australia, Metallic Starlings (Aplonis metallica) nest in large colonies far above the forest canopy, in emergent trees. The ground beneath those trees is open, in stark contrast to the dense foliage all around. We surveyed the areas beneath 27 colony trees (and nearby randomly chosen trees lacking bird colonies) to quantify the birds' impacts on soil and vegetation characteristics, and to test alternative hypotheses about the proximate mechanisms responsible for the lack of live vegetation beneath colony trees. Nutrient levels were greatly elevated beneath colony trees (especially, those with larger colonies), potentially reaching levels toxic to older trees. However, seedlings thrived in the soil from beneath colony trees. The primary mechanism generating open areas beneath colony trees is disturbance by scavengers (feral pigs and native Turkeys) that are attracted in vast numbers to these nutrient hotspots. Seedlings flourished within exclosures inaccessible to vertebrate herbivores, but were rapidly consumed if unprotected. Our results contrast with previous studies of colonies of seabirds on remote islands, where a lack of large terrestrial herbivores results in bird colonies encouraging rather than eliminating vegetation in areas close to the nesting site. In our continental study system, scavengers may rapidly dilute the spatial heterogeneity generated by the massive nutrient subsidy from bird colonies.","0012-9658

Taiwan reported its first discovery of SFTSV in sheep and humans in 2020. However, the prevalence of SFTSV in domestic and wildlife animals and the geographic distribution of the virus within the island remain unknown. A total of 1324 animal samples, including 803 domestic ruminants, 521 wildlife animals and 47 tick pools, were collected from March 2021 to December 2022 from 12 counties and one terrestrial island. The viral RNA was detected by a one-step real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Overall, 29.9% (240/803) of ruminants showed positive SFTSV RNA. Sheep had the highest viral RNA prevalence of 60% (30/50), followed by beef cattle at 28.4% (44/155), goats at 28.3% (47/166), and dairy cows at 27.5% (119/432). The bovine as a total of dairy cow and beef cattle was 27.8% (163/587). The viral RNA prevalence in ticks (predominantly Rhipicephalus microplus) was similar to those of ruminants at 27.7% (13/47), but wild animals exhibited a much lower prevalence at 1.3% (7/521). Geographically the distribution of positivity was quite even, being 33%, 29.1%, 27.5% and 37.5% for northern, central, southern and eastern Taiwan, respectively. Statistically, the positive rate of beef cattle in the central region (55.6%) and dairy cattle in the eastern region (40.6%) were significantly higher than the other regions; and the prevalence in Autumn (September-November) was significantly higher than in the other seasons (p < 0.001). The nationwide study herein revealed for the first time the wide distribution and high prevalence of SFTSV in both domestic animals and ticks in Taiwan. Considering the high mortality rate in humans, surveillance of other animal species, particularly those in close contact with humans, and instigation of protective measures for farmers, veterinarians, and especially older populations visiting or living near farms or rural areas should be prioritized.

We compare our findings to the previous published survey conducted in December 1979–January 1980. Over the last 40 years, the island's landscape has changed dramatically from one of farmland to predominantly native forest. As a result, the habitat has shifted toward supporting a larger assemblage of endemic and native birds, and away from supporting those that are non-native. Kiore, or Pacific rats (Rattus exulans), remain abundant across the island, though densities are lower compared to estimates of the previous survey. The richness of reptile species also appears to have declined over the past few decades. Overall, we suggest Motukawanui is a relatively straightforward island from which to eradicate rats. Such an eradication would require approval from local iwi but would directly contribute to meeting interim goals of the Predator Free 2050 initiative.

However, analysing the effects of multi‐scalar and potentially co‐occurring disturbances is particularly challenging in dry islands. Here, we aim to identify the ecological consequences of the integrated impacts of a regional drying trend, volcanic eruptions and human mass migrations in a spatially constrained environment—a small, dry oceanic island in Macaronesia. Location Brava Island, Republic of Cabo Verde. Taxa Terrestrial vegetation and fungi. Methods We use palaeoecological analyses applied to a caldera soil profile that dates back to 9700 cal yr BP (calibrated years before the present). Analyses include pollen (vegetation history), non‐pollen palynomorphs (changes in fern and fungal communities), grain‐size distribution, loss‐on‐ignition and geochemistry (sedimentology and erosion regimes), microscopic tephra shards (volcanic ash deposition) and charcoal (fire regime). Results A regional drying trend after c. 4000 cal yr BP caused increased erosion but had limited immediate impacts on highland grassland vegetation. The expansion of fern‐rich woody scrubland was contemporaneous with significant deposition of volcanic ash and erosion between 1800 and 650 cal yr BP. About 300 cal yr BP, exogenous plants expanded, grazing and fires increased, and there was a decrease of native vegetation cover. Main conclusions Throughout the Holocene, highland vegetation in Brava was characterized by the presence of open landscapes dominated by herbaceous species (e.g. Poaceae, Forsskaolea ), with some presence of woody native taxa (e.g. Ficus , Dodonaea ). A regional drying trend was a driver of erosion since the Mid Holocene but did not have an immediate influence on highland vegetation. Tephra deposition is a possible driver of vegetation change. Inter‐island mass migration after volcanic events in Fogo Island c. 1680 CE potentially triggered land use change and intensification, causing a reduction of native vegetation in Brava.

The sampling campaigns were designed to: (i) study the ecology of introduced mammals; (ii) assess the impact of introduced mammals on native birds (Azores woodpigeon - Columba palumbus azorica and Cory's shearwater - Calonectris diomeda borealis), through nest predation; and (iii) obtain information about the impact of vertebrates on agricultural systems, particularly on Azorean traditional vineyards. A total of 258 sites and 47 nests were sampled using camera traps. These sampling campaigns provided a large data series that allowed the creation of a vertebrate wildlife inventory.We obtained a total of 102,095 camera-trap records, which allowed us to to identify 30 species of vertebrates: one amphibian, one reptile, 17 birds and ten mammal species. This represented 100% of the amphibians and terrestrial mammals, 58% of the breeding birds and 50% of the reptile species known for Pico and/or Terceira islands. Concerning the colonisation status of the species, we recorded 15 indigenous (native non-endemic or endemic) and three introduced bird species; all known terrestrial amphibians, reptiles and mammals in the Azores are introduced species. The data collected contribute to increasing knowledge on the distribution of vertebrate species on Pico and Terceira islands, where most existing records of some species were only available to Island level (e.g. mustelids and hedgehogs). None of the identified species was previously unknown to the study area.

Anjanaharibe-Sud Special Reserve is a recently expanded rainforest protected area that is lacking detailed surveys and assessments of the native carnivore community of the endemic family Eupleridae. To identify which terrestrial carnivores occupy the reserve and what anthropogenic disturbances and factors best explain their occurrence patterns, we deployed 35 motion-activated cameras to detect native and introduced carnivores. From November 2018 to February 2019, we collected 2918 unique capture events (all species) and confirmed the presence of 5 euplerids: Galidia elegans , Galidictis fasciata , Eupleres goudotii , Fossa fossana , and Cryptoprocta ferox . These results extend the known range of E. goudotii and G. fasciata . In the reserve, F. fossana and G. elegans were the most common and widespread native carnivores, while E. goudotii was the rarest. We highlight the negative impact of edge effects on G. fasciata and F. fossana and the threat posed by the free-ranging non-native carnivore C. familiaris . This study represents the first detailed survey and occurrence estimates of the carnivore community of this protected area, allowing comparison with other protected areas in Madagascar. Our empirical findings show that anthropogenic disturbance negatively impacts carnivore existence within the Anjanaharibe-Sud Special Reserve and provide important management recommendations for protecting the carnivore community and the co-occurring wildlife living within this area.

They were installed in two typical locations differing in vegetation cover. First group was set in a seashore ecosystem dominated by moss carpet supplemented with few lichen species. The other group was located on the top of a volcanic mesa (350 m a.s.l.) with irregular cover of lichens Usnea antarctica and Umbilicaria decussata. Temperature regimes inside and outside OTCs were continuously measured and related to year-round reference meteorological data. For majority of OTC installations, temperature increase caused by OTC was apparent in the period of September-March. Detailed analysis of chamber effect on the increase in air, surface, vegetation, and ground temperatures was done for late austral summer seasons of 2007 and 2008, and 10 years later, the seasons of 2017 and 2018. The OTC-induced temperature increase was more pronounced for mesa than seashore plot. For both locations, OTC-induced increase in temperature was highest for warm days with full sunshine and limited wind speed. On stormy days with overcast sky and high wind speed, the shift in temperature was smaller. Consequences of a long-term manipulation of Antarctic terrestrial ecosystems by OTCs for moss and lichen ecophysiology are discussed.

","Vélez, Manuel",,,,,1967.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"D
URING the last few years of extensive studies on the millipeds of the Greater Puerto Rico Region, the author became extremely
interested in the geographic distribution and
certain ecological aspects of the terrestrial and
freshwater decapods of this area. As a result
this, a fair size collection has now been accumulated, which is now being studied in order to
have a clearer picture of certain aspects of the
biology of these crustaceans in these islands.
Although it seems that most species present
on these islands have already been reported in
previous works, the latter merely indicate scattered records of the species involved and with
only very few exceptions (Cardisoma guanhumi) has the distribution or ecology been
treated extensively or adequately. The most
important and comprehensive studies in Puerto
Rico thus far, have been those Benedict (1901),
Rathbun (1902, 1933), and Schmitt (1935).
Only one paper (Feliciano, 1962) deals in some
detail with the biology of any one species
(Cardisoma gumhumi). The monumental monograph of Holthuis (1952) on the Palaemoninae has not only clarified the taxonomy of
the genus Macrobrachium but has also added
a new record for Puerto Rico. In a latter publication the same author (1954) erected the
genus Potimirim to replace (in part) Ortmannia
Rathbun,
Potimirim
Carib. J.
1902). The newly proposed genus
included two Puerto Rican species
Sci. 7 (1-2). March-June 1967.

Ortmannia mexicana (de Saussure, 1858), and
O. serrei Bouvier, 1909, however, in 1961
Hart became aware of the fact that it was advisable to segregate Potimirim serrei into a new
monotypical genus which he named Jonga.
Because the work that is being carried out
in this group at present will take some time
for completion, it seems advisable to publish
at this time the following Checklist of The
Terrestrial and Freshwater Decapoda as a preliminary step of this project, since it should
be of some assistance to those biologists who
might want to pursue studies on the biology
of these crustaceans. Most of the common
species present in mangrove swamps sandy
beach shores and river banks as well as those
forms of Callinectes, which might at one time
or another go up some distance into the rivers
have been includeded in this paper.

here is so extensive, only the most important

In the Philippines, two species are thus far known: G. javanica (Blume, 1825: 421) Lindley (1840: 384) and G. verrucosa Blume (1856: 175). Both have a widespread distribution in northern Malesia and southern East Asia. During fieldwork for the Co’s Digital Flora of the Philippine project (Pelser et al. 2011 onwards) in early December 2012, Gastrodia plants were photographed that belong to a third Philippine species. These plants were observed in three areas on the island of Mindanao: Mt. Apo Natural Park (North Cotabato Prov.) and two sites in Mt. Kitanglad Range Natural Park (Lantapan and Baungon municipalities; Bukidnon Prov.). In December 2015, plants belonging to the same species were collected in Northern Negros Natural Park (Victorias City, Negros Occidental Prov., Negros) and in March 2016 plants were photographed in Barlig (Mountain Prov., Luzon). Morphological studies showed that this species is distinct from all Gastrodia species except G. spathulata (Carr, 1935: 180) Wood (in Wood et al. 2011: 355) in having petals that are considerably shorter than the calyx tube and separate from it about half way along the inner surface of the tube. It differs from G. spathulata in the longer adnation of the petals to the calyx tube, the shape of the petals and their lack of indumentum, and characters of the lip ridges. Assuming that these morphological differences are an indication of reproductive isolation, we name and describe these plants here as a new species under a biological species concept (Mayr 2000).

",,,,"Background and Purpose: The phytogeography of remote minor islands in open Adriatic was insufficiently studied, and their manor phytocenoses were nearly unknown so far Especially for Svetac and Brusnik the available data were restricted to notes on land flora, and the indications for adjacent phytobenthos were scarce. Folk phytonymes of Dalmatian algae till now were neglected and nearly unknown. The main aim of actual paper is to list the unknown algal flora at Svetac with algal folk names, and to give its zoning of phytocenoses, with additions to complete their land flora. Material and Methods:Actual survey of benthic macroalgae and insular Mediterranean vegetation is the result of iterative field studies in Svetac and near islets in central Adriatic, in different seasons from 1975 to 1999. The shallow bottom to 7m was prospected along shores, and deeper to 25m in selected representative profiles. Algal phytonymes were noted from the experienced old fishers of port Komiza who frequently visited Svetac, and they offered us also some algae dragged by nets from major depths in that area, indicating e.g. some sites of Laminaria and Sporochnus with folk names. Results and Conclusions: The studied phytobenthos at the remote island Svetac (Stondria) and near islets Kamik, Ondrin and Brusnik includes 276 marine taxa: 167 rhodophytes, 65 pheophytes, 42 chlorophytes, and 2 seagrasses, with a low RIP ratio of 2.2. After our recent insights, terrestrial flora of Svetac island includes 444 vascular taya (54 in Brusnik islet), and it is rather rich if compared with similar Adriatic islands of average size. In the vegetation of Svetac and Brusnik we registered 28 main phytocenoses in 8 benthic and altitudinal belts, with 11 terrestrial communities and 17 marine ones. Both vascular and algal vegetation in Svetac area is true Mediterranean and almost similar to those in otherremote islands of central Adriatic and of Mediterranean offing, Within the Adriatic Archipelago, Svetac has a southern vegetation of Thermo-Mediterranean type, its halophytic vegetation includes 9 insular endemics, and the surrounding phytobenthos is especially rich in coralligene phytocenoses with 30 taxa of calcified algae. Among the noted folk names of algae at Svetac, 15 marine phytonymes of Komiza fishers are poorer than in shores of Northwestern Europe, but they are among the richest ones within Mediterranean.","0031-5362

The Atlantic sector of the Antarctic, in which the Survey operates, is of key importance biologically. The Antarctic provides a striking biological contrast between a species-poor and very barren terrestrial ecosystem and the species-rich and productive ocean which surrounds it. Severe climatic conditions and great isolation (a contrast to the Arctic) characterize the Antarctic environment. Work at the Survey's biological research stations is designed to study the distribution and interactions of organisms and communities, how they have adapted to Antarctic conditions, and which by their abundance may be deemed successful. Research is done into terrestrial, fresh-water and marine systems. Additionally, there is a major research programme into the biologv, environment and principal predators of krill, Euphausia superba.

Heavy metals (HM) are among the most common technogenic pollutants that may negatively affect the functioning of the Arctic's soil-based terrestrial ecosystems. There is almost no research on the actual HM content in the soils of Novaya Zemlya (NZ), and the purpose of this work is to assess the HM content in the soils of Severny Island in the NZ archipelago. The study was performed at Russkaya Gavan, Ledyanaya Gavan, Blagopoluchiya Bay, and Cape Zhelaniya. The soil cover in the northern part of Severny Island has a mosaic structure. On Severny Island, Cryosols (Loamic) are the most common soils among the soils studied in this work. Soils of the study regions on Severny Island are mostly loamy and clayey. The proportion of physical clay increases down the profiles. All study soils of NZ are alkaline and highly alkaline. In general, study soils have an acceptable level of HM contamination. The weighted average HM gross content in them varies insignificantly; however, the following elements exceed their threshold concentrations: Fe (1.1 clarke) – Russkaya Gavan bay; Fe (1.2 clarke), Cr (1.1 clarke), V (1.1 maximum permissible concentration (MPC)), Ti (1.1 clarke) – Blagopoluchiya bay; Fe (1.3 clarke) – Ledyanaya Gavan bay. This, apparently, is caused by their high contents in the soil-forming rock.

Here, three main constraints were extracted as important factors on the mustelid assemblage. First, fundamental evolutionary differences maintained by niche conservatism in each ecologically diversified lineage (""evolutionary constraint"") would enable the species to co-occur without any major problem (coexistence among Martes, Meles, and Mustela species). Second, ""ecological constraints"" would force two closely related species to be allopatric by competitive exclusion (Mu. itatsi and Mu. sibirica) or to be sympatric by resource partitions (Mu. erminea and Mu. nivalis). Third and most importantly, ""geological constraints"" would allow specific species to be embraced by a particular geographic region, primarily deciding which species co-occurs. The allopatric distribution of two Martes species in Japan would have been established by the strong effect of the geological separation in Tsugaru Strait. Elucidating both phylogeny and ecology of co-existing species in a community assemblage is important to know which species possess distinct lineage and which ecological traits are adapted to local environments, fulfilling the requirement of the field of conservation biology that endemism and adaptation should both be considered. The Japanese archipelagos would, therefore, provide valuable insight into the conservation for small carnivoran species.

SUMMARY Out of the more than 160 Sardinian satellite islands, islets and rocks with a covering of vascular plants (Tables I-II), 116 have been surveyed for the presence of reptiles and amphibians (Table I). Their occurrence was verified in 102 of the satellite islands (Table III), a figure which will surely increase in the future; the tiny, nocturnal and cryptozoic gelckonid P/131110:/aclylz/I europaezzx, f. i., probably occurs on all or almost all Circumsardinian islands as it is able to survive even on extremely small, barren and semi-naked rocks. Among the water-linked batrachians, all the autochthonous Sardinian anurans, occur in the largest sui- table satellite islands (Dz&#39;.\‘c0gZ0m2_t mrclzu‘, Hy/:1 mrda, Bzzfo I/mic/1&#39;s), while the rather recently naturalized Ra/zzz sinltlepton esculenta is lacking; the absence of the only Sardinian salamandrid, the endemic Ezzproctz/X plat)?- cep/Jalux, is surely due to ecological constraints. On the contrary the absence of the four terrestrial endemic salamanders Hydrama/zler ﬂazms, H. _rup1m/20/Itix, H. iI2Iperz&#39;z1lix and H. gezzei, even on the largest islands where they could very propably survive, seems to be due to zoogeographical reasons; in fact, up till now, all the coastal areas facing the above-mentioned islands are devoid of any members of the family Plethodontidae. There are 18 Sardinian species of reptiles, 16 of which occur on the satellite islands: Emy: ar[7z&#39;czzlm&#39;z&#39;r ctzpolazzgai, Test:/do graezra grzzeca, Testz/do /Jer/71a/2/71&#39; /Jerzzzmz/H’, Textudo Iizzzrgzmzta, Hemz&#39;dzzclylzz.t Imricz/3&#39;, Tare/ztala /izamita/1z&#39;cz1 ;7zazm&#39;tzzIzz&#39;ca, P/Jyllodactylm ez/ropaez1.r, /llgyroidex fz&#39;lzz&#39;/zgeri, Arc/Jrzeolacerta [2ezz’I&#39;z&#39;(1gzze pczessleri, Pat/zzrcir tzﬁgzzemz (with the «subspecies» /iliguerta, m/Izii and tom), Podarcis sicula (with the «sub- speciesgg cettii), C/Jalczkler c/Jzzlczkles vzﬂatm, C/mlczklex ocellzzlzzx tiligugu, Hemorr/Joir /Jz&#39;ppocrepz&#39;5, Hzerap/Jii‘ v1&#39;r/dzﬂzzzzzzx, Natrix /zzazzra.

P.Beauv.) is an invasive species commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions worldwide, consequently threatening global plant biodiversity, and sustainable agriculture. Nevertheless, some of its potential as a medicinal herb, phytoremediation agent, and alternative energy have been reported. genetic variation of cogongrass has been studied in certain areas, however genetic variation in Java, Indonesia has not been reported. Therefore, this study aims to assess the genetic variation of cogongrass in Java, Indonesia using atpB-rbcLand trnL-F intergenic spacer (IGS). Twenty-one plant samples were collected randomly from nine different sites and two pairs of universal primers were employed to amplify the markers. The results showed a much lower genetic difference among subpopulations in comparison to genetic variation within individual subpopulations. This result indicates that the subpopulations have high connectivity, meaning the rapid change in terrestrial ecosystems on the island does not affect the cogongrass population.

",,,,"Context: Mangroves and intertidal habitats have been identified as particularly challenging environments for bait application within both tropical and temperate environments, because bait applied to areas that are tidally inundated could degrade rapidly or become inaccessible to rats.

Aims: To determine rat density, ranging behaviour and probability of detection using different monitoring devices; additionally, to determine the availability (persistence, durability and uptake) of rodenticide baits within tidally inundated mangrove habitats.

Methods: The population biology of black rats (Rattus rattus) was studied in two contrasting mangrove habitats on Europa Island, and spatially explicit mark–recapture studies were performed to estimate densities and activity of rats. A series of bait availability trials was conducted to determine the durability of rodenticide baits on the ground and uptake in the canopy (‘bait bolas’).

Key results: Black rats were found to be abundant in mangrove, and despite daily tidal inundation, still maintained ranging behaviour consistent with rats in adjacent terrestrial habitats. Larger rodenticide bait blocks remained within tidally inundated habitat throughout tidal cycles and were available and remained palatable to rats for at least three consecutive nights, although strong bait competition occurred with crabs. Bait bolas were available in mangrove canopy exclusively to rats and consumption commenced on the first night.

Conclusions: The results provide evidence that mangrove habitats are an important habitat for rats, but the biology of rats in these habitats does not meaningfully differ from adjacent terrestrial habitats. With the use of larger rodenticide blocks, tidal inundation does not affect bait availability, but crabs remain a major competitor for these baits. Alternatively, the present study revealed that bait bolas limit bait access to rats alone. Development as an aerial eradication technology should be also recommended.","1035-3712

",,,,,,"The Westland petrel (Procellaria westlandica) is a 1200 g medium-sized seabird whose breeding colonies are dispersed across 700 ha of forest on the western coast of South Island, New Zealand.These birds represent the sole landscape-scale lowland remnant of formerly widespread petrel and shearwater colonies in mainland New Zealand and provide an opportunity to investigate maritime species' impact on terrestrial ecosystems characteristic of pre-human New Zealand.This review develops a conceptual model of biogeochemical processes influenced by Westland petrels from a single burrow to individual colonies and thence to a catchment scale.Results show the distinctiveness of the Westland petrel system, with colonies moving around the landscape in response to local damage by earthquakes and storms.Based on monitored streams in forested landscapes elsewhere, storms also control N and P fluxes to streams.Non-seabird temperate forests are dominated by mycorrhizal plant-soil interactions, but the high N and P status of Westland petrel colony soils minimises the role of fungi in soil processes, including trace element (Se) uptake.The more N-rich C:N ratio in tree foliage within habitat occupied by the colony may provide nutritional support for terrestrial herbivorous animals, including those whose ranges extend beyond the colony.Overall, the review emphasises the spatial and temporal dynamics of the Westland petrel terrestrial ecosystem, and highlights potential ecological linkages that connect colonies to the wider landscape.

Relative abundances of the White-throated Ground-Dove, Mariana Fruit-Dove, Collared Kingfisher, Micronesian Starling, and Micronesian Myzomela all increased during the study period. Abundances of the Golden White-eye and Rufous Fantail followed a curvilinear trend that increased during the first half of the survey period (1991–2000) and decreased in the second half (2001–2010). Abundances of the remaining species (Island Collared-Dove, Bridled White-eye, Nightingale Reed-Warbler, and Eurasian Tree Sparrow) showed no significant trends. The most numerous species (over 40 individuals detected per survey), in decreasing order of abundance, were the Bridled Whiteeye, Rufous Fantail, Golden White-eye, Micronesian Starling, and Micronesian Myzomela. The total abundance of birds increased on average by 0.27 birds per year, per survey station, island-wide. Three stations out of 47 (6.4%) recorded a significant loss of total birds over the time period, and bird numbers increased significantly at only one station (2.1%). Stations at which we detected declines were clustered in the northern, less-populated, region of Saipan. We explored the relationship between typhoon frequency/severity and bird abundance to explain trend patterns but found no significant correlation. We suggest ways to improve roadside surveys as a management tool to aid in detecting avian declines that are of conservation concern.","0030-8870

",,,,"Late Quaternary fossils representing a locally extinct population of the Cuban crocodile (Crocodylus rhombifer) are reported from two underwater caves in the Dominican Republic. A large fossil sample of C. rhombifer, from Oleg's Bat Cave near Bavaro in the southeastern Dominican Republic, consists of four nearly complete skulls, numerous isolated cranial elements and mandibles, and more than 100 postcranial bones representing most of the skeleton. These fossils were collected from a completely submerged portion of the cave at a depth of 11 m and about 100 m from the nearest entrance. A skull, mandibles, and two vertebrae of a Cuban crocodile were also found in a second cave called Ni-Rahu, northeast of Santo Domingo.We identify the fossil crocodile skulls from the Dominican Republic as Crocodylus rhombifer because they share the following characters with modern skulls of C. rhombifer from Cuba (as well as fossil skulls from Cuba, the Bahamas, and Cayman Islands): short, broad, and deep rostrum; large orbits; convex nasals along the midline (midrostral boss); prominent swelling on the lacrimals anterior and medial to the orbits; low but obvious ridges extending anteriorly from the lacrimals to the nasals and posteriorly from the lacrimals to the prefrontals and frontals, outlining a distinct diamond- or rhomboid-shaped structure; strongly concave interorbital region and cranial roof; high, narrow ridges on the internal margins of the orbits, extending from the prefrontals to the frontals and posteriorly to the postorbitals; prominent ridges along the lateral margins of the cranial roof on the postorbitals and squamosals, terminating as noticeable protuberances on the posterolateral corners of the squamosals; premaxillary/maxillary suture on the palate essentially horizontal or transverse to the long axis of the skull at the level of the first maxillary tooth; 13 teeth in the maxilla.Certain aspects of the ecology and anatomy of living Crocodylus rhombifer in Cuba, and carbon isotope data from fossil crocodile bones from both the Dominican Republic and the Bahamas, indicate that the Cuban crocodile is a terrestrially adapted predator. The fossil deposits in Oleg's Bat Cave and other underwater caves in the Dominican Republic lack freshwater vertebrates, such as fish and turtles, but contain abundant samples of hystricognath rodents, small ground sloths, and other terrestrial vertebrates, including large land tortoises, that apparently were the primary prey of the crocodiles. Bats are abundant in the fossil deposits in Oleg's Bat Cave, and may have been an additional food source. Bone collagen from a tibia of C. rhombifer from Oleg's Bat Cave yielded an AMS radiocarbon date of 6460 ±30 ryrBP (equivalent to 7320 to 7430 cal yrBP). The chronology for the local extinction of C. rhombifer in Hispaniola is currently unknown, except to document the presence of this species in the eastern Dominican Republic in the early Holocene. Radiocarbon dates and historical records confirm that Cuban crocodiles survived into the period of European colonization (post-1492) in the Bahamas and on Grand Cayman. The only species of crocodile currently found in Hispaniola, the American crocodile (C. acutus), occurs in coastal marine habitats and in two inland brackishwater lakes: Lago Enriquillo in the Dominican Republic and the nearby Etang Saumâtre in Haiti. C. acutus has no fossil record in Hispaniola or elsewhere in the West Indies, suggesting that this species may be a very recent (late Holocene) immigrant in the Antillean region. Crocodylus rhombifer has one of the most limited geographic ranges of any living crocodylian species, known only from freshwater swamps in south-central Cuba and the Isla de Juventud (Isla de Pinos) off the southwestern coast of Cuba. Locally extinct or extirpated populations of C. rhombifer from fossil deposits in the Dominican Republic, Grand Cayman, and the Bahamas document a considerably wider distribution for this spe

",,,,"Invasive species have caused substantial ecological and economic problems globally (Lowe, Browne, Boudjelas, & De Poorter, 2000). In the United States, the economic cost of non-indigenous species invasions is estimated to be between US$128 and US$147 billion annually (Pimentel, Zuniga, & Morrison, 2005), but the total cost is likely to be greater if ecosystem damage is also considered (Lovell, Stone, & Fernandez, 2006). Of this, economic losses from the effects of invasive fish in aquatic systems are believed to comprise US$1–5.7 billion annually (Pimentel et al., 2005). In New Zealand, a number of invasive fish species occur and are, in some places, particularly abundant. The acknowledged epicentre and only formally defined containment area for invasive koi carp (an ornamental strain of Cyprinus carpio) in New Zealand is located in the North Island in the Lower Waikato River Basin (LWRB; Grainger, 2015). Eutrophic conditions combined with a temperate climate and connected shallow riverine lakes and wetlands provide ideal conditions for the proliferation of this (Bajer et al., 2015; Vilizzi, Tarkan, & Copp, 2015) and other invasive fish such as the brown bullhead catfish Ameiurus nebulosus and goldfish Carassius auratus. In this paper, we describe an invasive fish management programme where unwanted organisms are removed from the aquatic habitat and converted into beneficial products to address or support environmental issues and initiatives related to conservation and/or restoration. The underlying closed loop philosophy of the programme is also to demonstrate core values of traceability and sustainability in the development, deployment and performance of these products. In particular, we discuss the importance of nutrient transfer between ecosystems, from aquatic organism capture through to uptake in terrestrial and coastal environments to illustrate the integrated framework within two case studies. The first study describes the use of processed invasive fish as a replacement for imported synthetic fertiliser tablets typically used in small-to-medium scale replanting programmes by restoration managers and community groups. For this case, we describe an experiment conducted across a regional dune restoration planting programme. The second is the use of invasive fish material as a lure in trapping programmes to control other introduced pests (e.g. introduced rats and mustelids) which have undesirable impacts on native terrestrial plant and animal taxa in New Zealand. Invasive fish for both these case studies were harvested at our invasive fish “demonstration site” using a fixed semi-automated fish cage (Figure 1). The fish cage is fitted with a customised mesh shape and size to minimise native fish by-catch while retaining the smallest invasive fish possible (David, 2015). Following euthanasia, fish are processed on site in a bacterial digester. Historically marine seabird nesting sites were abundant throughout coastal New Zealand dunes and the marine-derived nutrients that birds brought back to nesting sites were important for fuelling growth of native sand-binding dune plants (Hawke & Newman, 2007). These plant species have undergone substantial population declines, however, due to a range of human-induced stressors (Hawke & Newman, 2007). Nitrogen is now recognised to be the limiting nutrient for plants in these dune systems (Bergin & Kimberley, 1999) and planting programmes aimed at restoring dune plants generally use artificial fertiliser tablets to replace depleted nutrients and improve long-term plant survival and growth. A wide range of fertiliser tablets are available to consumers varying in nutrient and trace element composition, and different tablets are often used interchangeably by community groups in restoration planting programmes. However, tracing the source(s) of components used in artificial fertiliser manufacture, the majority of which are imported from overseas, can be a formidable challenge (Wood & Cowie, 2004). The production and distribution of artificial fertilisers, particularly those containing nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and potassium (K), are energy intensive (Bindraben, Dimpka, Nagarajan, Roy, & Rabbinge, 2015). Atmospheric N is typically synthesised into a useable form via the Haber–Bosch process, and the energy source used to drive the process (typically natural gas or gassified coal) results in emissions which purportedly vary considerably from 3.42 (EU) to 11.06 (China) kg CO2/kg N produced (Fertilisers Europe 2016, http://www.yara.dk/godning/miljo/reducing-carbon-footprint/fertilizer-life-cycle-perspective/life-cycle-analysis-of-ammonium-nitrate/). Phosphate on the other hand is typically mined from finite resources. Both processes generate considerable greenhouse gas emissions and other waste products (Wood & Cowie, 2004). Therefore, understanding the life cycle of components (footprint) used to assemble and produce an artificial tablet (that may subsequently be used in a restoration project) is in our view an important consideration. Recently proposed regulations for fertilisers by the European Commission to encourage use of recycled materials (e.g. biowaste) and to reduce, for example, soil accumulation of cadmium (an element commonly found in artificial fertiliser; Fertiliser Matters 2016) supports this perspective. Our proposed approach is a low footprint, locally produced recycling process where the infeed materials comprise predominantly unwanted organism protein (invasive fish) and other local recycled by-products (e.g. untreated sawdust, Figure 1). In terms of ecosystem energetics, fish provide a valuable nutrient recycling service in freshwater because these fish convert ingested material into biomass as they grow (Andersson, Granéli, & Stenson, 1988; Drenner, Day, Basham, Durward Smith, & Jensen, 1997). For instance, a study by Kitchell, Foonce, and Tennis (1975) calculated that up to 70% of phosphorus in the pelagic zone of Lake Wingra, USA, was embodied in fish biomass and that decomposition of dead post-spawned fish was likely to contribute substantially to the supply of phosphorus in lakes. Although carp also liberate nutrients during defecation and suctorial feeding (Morgan & Hicks, 2013), comparative phosphorus contributions from excretion of live fish are likely to be much lower (Andersson et al., 1988). The ability to remove this nutrient-rich biomass and reuse it elsewhere may be particularly beneficial to systems like the LWRB where substantial nutrient losses from intensive agriculture into water bodies have resulted in water quality declines driven predominantly by increases in total phosphorus and nitrate (Vant, 2008). In this case study, we compared the performance of recycled invasive fish fertiliser against artificial tablets for fuelling two species of dune plants—the New Zealand endemic sand-binding pingao Ficinia spiralis and native spinifex Spinifex sericeus. These species were planted in three coastal New Zealand dune systems to compare growth (plant spread and vigour) in response to nutrient additions at the time of planting (i.e. invasive fish and commercial fertiliser tablets vs. no fertiliser controls). The pelletised invasive fish had a lower nitrogen content than the tablets (Table S4), so to ensure comparability in trials, 72 g of fish pellets was equivalent to a 10 g commercial fertiliser tablet. Three dose rates were tested (1, 2 or 3 tablets, 72, 144 or 216 g pellets, Figure 2). More specific methodological and result details for this case study including experimental design, planting plot layouts and replication can be found in the supplementary information provided (Supplementary information 1, Figures S1 and S2). In summary, in most cases, invasive fish pellets produced a similar boost in plant growth and vigour to that achieved using commercial fertiliser pellets at all three sites and all fertilised plants grew significantly greater with respect to vigour and spread than no fertiliser controls (ANOVA, 0.05, Figures 3 and 4, Tables S1–S3, Figure S3). There was little additional growth at the medium- and high-dose rates for either fertiliser type suggesting that a single dose of either tablets or pellets is sufficient for growth performance while maintaining manageable field deployment logistics (material transport and application, Bergin & Bergin, 2016). Furthermore, stable isotope analysis of the nitrogen in dried dune plant material indicated clear uptake of nutrients into plant tissues from both pellets and tablets. Plants supplied with either fertiliser type (pellets or tablets) exhibited consistent but significantly different δ15N signatures, reflective of the origin and composition of the added nutrient source (Table 1). In effect, locally produced invasive fish pellets appear to be a viable and comparably performing alternative to imported artificial fertiliser tablets for dune restoration planting initiatives. In contrast to artificial tablets, information regarding the origin, composition and life cycle process to manufacture the fish pellets is transparent and traceable for consumers. We have also demonstrated that it is possible to regionally reposition nutrients embodied in invasive fish obtained from an ecosystem in which they are in excess and undesirable, into one in which they are presently depleted but were historically more naturally abundant. Flora and fauna in New Zealand exhibit high levels of endemism and organisms evolved in an environment that was historically free of terrestrial mammalian predators (Bull & Whitaker, 1975). Following relatively recent human occupation and the coincident introduction of numerous mammalian pests, catastrophic and widespread declines in biodiversity occurred (Atkinson, 1989), and continue today. Unsurprisingly, a wide range of governmental and community-based mammalian pest control and eradication programmes are in place throughout New Zealand and play an important role in biodiversity conservation (Ewen, Adams, & Renwick, 2013). Protein-based baits are typically used as lures for terrestrial pest control programmes. In particular, introduced mustelids (stoat Mustela erminea, weasel Mustela nivalis, ferret Mustela furo), feral cat Felis catus, rat species (Norway rat Rattus norvegicus, ship rat R. rattus), house mouse Mus musculus and European hedgehog Erinaceus europaeus are the primary targets for protein lures. Currently, the most effective lure is considered to be a commercially available rabbit-based product (“Erayz,” Connovations, NZ, C. Gillies, pers. comm.) that is typically deployed by conservation groups in kill traps. Chicken eggs are often used in tandem with rabbit jerky as an additional visual lure for mustelids. In this case study, a new line of 50 kill traps (DOC 250's, Curtis Metal Products, NZ—double-ended spring-loaded, http://www.predatortraps.com/) were established around the perimeter of the National Wetlands Centre, North Island, New Zealand. A combination of egg and rabbit or invasive fish pellet baits was placed in alternating kill traps by a local conservation community group with bait type (rabbit/egg or fish) in the first trap determined randomly. Traps were checked approximately monthly by volunteers (Figure 5) and results of any kills documented and reported. Preliminary results after 9 months of trapping suggest that invasive fish baits are attractive to some terrestrial pests, in particular hedgehogs and rats (Table 2). Currently, traps with fish bait have a greater number of confirmed kills for hedgehogs (Friedman rank sum test, p = .014), and a comparable number for rats (p = .479), compared to traps with rabbit/egg baits. Thus far, only stoats (p = .025) and mice (p = .045) have been preferentially lured by traps with rabbit/egg baits. Based on these results, invasive fish baits appear to be a durable, promising and complementary lure for controlling rats and hedgehogs in particular. Further ongoing testing is expected to provide more robust conclusions on the long-term effectiveness of fish-based bait for this purpose. Internationally many examples exist where invasive animals are commercially harvested from non-native habitats and various components reused. In most cases, the end products tend to support other human needs and wants with the majority of invasive product outputs related either directly or indirectly to food consumption (e.g. Nuñez, Kuebbing, Dimarco, & Simberloff, 2012) and or clothing production (e.g. http://thefishleather.co/). For example, there are cookbooks dedicated to the consumption of invasive species (e.g. Franke, 2007). As exemplified in the two trial case studies presented, the general philosophy of the “CarpN-neutral project” has been to use invasive species products for addressing other conservation problems rather than more typically creating products that directly benefit human consumption or use. Whether used as an alternative fertiliser or as a complementary lure in terrestrial pest control, the material has a low footprint and the products are likely to be organically certifiable. In New Zealand, organic certification can be obtained from two primary service providers: BioGrow NZ and AssureQuality. Each have minimum requirements to meet the standard for “compost” which predominantly relates to heavy metal concentrations and the presence of pesticides in the final invasive fish pellet product, both which have been extensively tested for with results suggesting that requirements could be met (Tables S5 and S6). An operational model whereby the running costs of this regional programme (currently paid for by regional ratepayers) could be recovered is possible with an increase in scale of our existing demonstration site (Figure 1). At present, managers and community groups pay an average of NZD 15 cents/artificial imported fertiliser tablet. Thus, to fertilise c. 350 dune plants with artificial fertilisers would cost around NZD $50 (c. 3.5 kg tablets)—for invasive fish pellets, NZD $50 equates to a 25 kg bag to deliver the same dose of nutrients to the same number of plants. The actual cost to produce 1 tonne (including pelletising and bagging but excluding harvest labour) is c. NZD $400. For pest lures or baits, rabbit jerky currently costs NZD 45c/piece/trap while the fish lure costs NZD 14c/trap (c. 70 g pellets/trap). However, it is acknowledged that commercialisation of such organisms can result in incentivising or facilitating further spread (Nuñez et al., 2012) which could result in a potential net environmental loss rather than gain (e.g. Barbier & Knowler, 2006). Consequently, our proposed regional government concept adopts a non-profit philosophy to remain cost neutral in this regard to discourage potential for profiteering through invasive species spread. A common argument regarding security of supply in such cases concerns the sustainability of the programme if harvest volumes decline due to intensive harvest pressure. Evidence from elsewhere in the Southern Hemisphere where invasive fish harvest has been commercialised suggests that, while temporary reductions in catch may occur within a given waterbody subject to intensive harvest, the wider population recovers rapidly once harvest pressure is reduced with little evidence of reductions in either distribution or biomass being sustained by harvest at larger scales (Koehn, Brumley, & Gehrke, 2000). Information relating to harvest impact is valuable for river managers as it clearly indicates that harvest pressure can reduce local biomass, and therefore, conservation priority catchments can be targeted for ongoing harvest pressure to achieve localised conservation outcomes (assuming other contributing anthropogenic pressures are also addressed). Meanwhile, a wider strategy which allows for a centralised processing facility and safe disposal point for harvest occurring in other areas, or by other entities (e.g. commercial operators, recreational anglers) could ensure security of supply of material. For instance during 2016, the CarpN Neutral programme provided a fish disposal service for the New Zealand Bowhunters Society at the annual “Koi Carp Classic” (http://www.nzbowhunters.nz/events/koi-carp-classic/) where c. 5 tonnes of invasive fish were harvested from the river by members during the event. These fish were then processed into pellets and later used in regional dune restoration planting. Although the scale of our dune planting trials was relatively small (2,400 plants in total), annual nursery propagation of sand-binding dune plants in New Zealand is estimated to be around 250,000 plants. If each of these plants was provided with 72 g fish pellets, c. 18 tonnes of invasive fish fertiliser (equivalent to c. 40 tonnes of processed wet weight fish) could be repositioned into dunes annually potentially replacing c. 2.5 tonnes of artificial fertiliser tablets. An important consideration of our concept is traceability and sustainability through various parts of the programme including: minimising by-catch of native fish species (David, 2015), using an energy efficient method to process invasive fish onsite (thermophilic bacteria), minimising carbon use in both production and distribution by using the material locally (Figures 1 and 6) and incorporating carbon into the product in the form of sawdust. As part of the dune planting experiment, we undertook chemical analyses of two other commercial fertiliser tablets commonly used in New Zealand. We noted that there was high variability in different trace and heavy metal elements between these two tablets (Tables S4 and S5). Although quality manufacturing standards for commercial artificial fertiliser production exist, disclosing all components within them (e.g. compounds for binding) appears to be voluntary. Taking our concept one step further, we are currently trialling the incorporation of biochar, a by-product of pyrolysis from corn production, into digested invasive fish. Biochar has been shown to increase nitrogen retention and lower greenhouse gas emissions when added to animal compost (Agyarco-Mintah et al., 2016). With respect to the use of biochar in fish pellets, the objective is to test its performance as a slow release fertiliser and also as a means of long-term carbon replacement and storage in sand and soil. Significant potential to further develop raw invasive fish flesh and liquid for use in other conservation projects also exists. For instance, foliar application of digested invasive fish “juice” as a potential liquid fertiliser and anti-lagomorph (e.g. rabbit) browse/repellent in native planting programmes is currently underway. New dune plantings can be heavily browsed by introduced herbivores during early growth. It is proposed that the oily content and strong “sulphurous” smell of this liquid may possess useful compounds as suggested by Trent, Nolte, and Wagner (2001), to reduce herbivorous browsing during early plant growth. At present, a U.S. produced bovine blood-based product is commonly applied in New Zealand for this purpose; http://www.plantskydd.com/rabbit-repellent.html.Other alternatives such as installing plant guards and fences to deter browsing in dunes are logistically challenging and costly to implement. Irrespective of the application, we posit that the simple approach of turning such outputs back into restoration programmes (and using products from one invasive animal to control another) creates potential to reduce overall costs for biodiversity enhancement and biosecurity while simultaneously dealing with unwanted organisms in areas where they are problematic. This project demonstrates a practical method of processing pest fish for use in restoration of other degraded ecosystems or put simply it is about “turning something bad into something good.” We consider this concept to be an alternative approach to restoration whereby an aquatic biosecurity problem is specifically being used to improve indigenous biodiversity outcomes across a range of other ecosystem types. We propose that this project is a useful vehicle to demonstrate genuine sustainability and promote awareness of the origin and fate of nutrients within and between ecosystems. It also illustrates alternate ways in which invasive products can be applied to these systems for positive environmental outcomes. A similar philosophy should be applicable to problematic and abundant invasive species elsewhere, particularly where those organisms are susceptible to either point source control or efficient mass harvest.

",,,,"Journal of Ecology was the first ecological journal in the world. It was established as the official publication of the newly formed British Ecological Society (BES) in 1913 under the leadership and guidance of the Society’s first President, Sir Arthur Tansley FRS (1871–1955; see Godwin 1977). Tansley’s vision for Journal of Ecology was presented in its first issue (Tansley 1913), in his two Presidential Addresses (Tansley 1914, 1939), and in a paper about the early history of modern plant ecology in Britain (Tansley 1947). Sheail (1987) also presents information about the thinking behind the establishment of Journal of Ecology in his book ‘Seventy-five Years in Ecology: the British Ecological Society’. Now, as the Journal celebrates its Centenary, Tansley’s vision remains relevant because he identified several important areas that, through the pages of Journal of Ecology, have been of fundamental importance in advancing the ways in which we study plant ecology, and our understanding of the subject.

Tansley specified two aims for the Journal of Ecology at its establishment. These were to “foster and promote in all ways the study of ecology in these islands”, and to “endeavour to present….a record of and commentary on the progress of ecology throughout the world” (Tansley 1913). These aims were to be conveyed to the ecological community through numerous publication formats, including what were described as general articles, articles and notes on current work in the British Isles, articles and notes on methods, reviews and notices of publications on British vegetation, answers to questions from members of the British Ecological Society, general correspondence, reports and notices of meetings of the Society, and notices of work on foreign vegetation. Each annual volume of the Journal originally consisted of four issues.

Readers familiar with Journal of Ecology will know that the types of articles published have changed considerably over the years. Initially, papers were strongly centred on the ecology of the British Isles. Given that Journal of Ecology has had an international reach and international flavour almost from the outset, it is surprising to find that it had originally been proposed that it would not publish foreign work. Tansley (1913) wrote that the view had been expressed that the inclusion of work from overseas might cause British work to be “smothered”! Good sense prevailed, however, and it was decided before publication of the first issue that foreign work should be included so that “the Society would be really furthering the interests of ecologists throughout the world” (Tansley 1913). Full length papers on foreign vegetation appeared in the Journal almost immediately, the first being Rübel’s (1914) study of forests in the Western Caucasus, and, following a visit to the United States, Tansley (1914) reported that submission of articles to the Journal had already been pledged by several leading American ecologists. A paper by Shantz (1917) on succession was probably the first of these to appear in print. The importance of publishing international research was soon fully accepted by the BES, and the international community of ecologists was encouraged to regard the Journal of Ecology as the natural venue for its best research.

The range of research fields published in Journal of Ecology has always been comprehensive. From the outset it accepted work on general principles, concepts, methods and surveys, and displayed a strong focus on synecological and autecological studies related to geography, geology, meteorology and climatology, plant physiology and anatomy, and floristic phytogeography (Tansley 1913). Autecological studies have remained a particular strength of the Journal throughout its first century of publication (e.g. Clapham 1956; Harper 1967), as reflected in the long-running series of detailed accounts of ecological knowledge about individual plant species published under the banner of the Biological Flora of the British Isles (http://www.britishecologicalsociety.org/journals_publications/journalofecology/biologicalflora.php ). The Journal has also been at the forefront in publishing research in new fields of study, including ecosystem ecology, a term that was introduced by Tansley (1935), genecology – a topic Tansley foresaw as of growing importance in his second Presidential Address (Tansley 1939) – quantitative ecology (Greig-Smith 1979), and chemical ecology (e.g. McCall & Fordyce 2010; Ali, Alborn & Stelinski 2011; Rassmann et al. 2011). As time has passed, the fields of research represented by papers in the Journal have increased in number, and the published output has become less dominated by single fields (Table 1). Tansley (1913) correctly predicted that study of the ecology of soil and other substrates, and above- and below-ground interactions, would become important topics of research activity although, despite several early papers on the topic in the Journal (e.g. Skene 1913; Blackman 1914) it has taken a long time for these fields to become fully established in the literature (Fitter 2005; Bardgett, de Deyn & Ostle 2009; Heil 2011).","0022-0477

",,,,"Traditional knowledge concerning plant utilization in the Philippines is common but is largely underappreciated. Assessment of plant resources by groups of people helps promote valorization of cultural heritage. However, particularly in the Camiguin Island of the North, Cagayan (not to be confused with the island province of Camiguin in Mindanao), the use of terrestrial plants remains unknown. As a response, this study aims to identify terrestrial plants in the island which have ethnobotanical importance through survey interview. The data collected were then analyzed using quantitative ethnobotanical methods. A total of 70 species belonging to 44 plant families were surveyed from the 33 informants. The statistical analysis showed a significant difference between male and female informants in terms of ethnobotanical knowledge. Lamiaceae was the most represented plant family with five species recorded. Leaves were the most used plant part (51%), congruent to previous ethnobotanical studies in the Philippines. Most medicinal preparations were done through decoctions (41.03%). Much of the medicinal plants surveyed were administered through topical medication (54.90%), and this is because the occupation of the people of Camiguin island mostly involves heavy physical activities. Thus, the probability of being wounded in the area is very high. It was found that Vitex negundo was the most used plant in Camiguin island with the used value of 0.15. Furthermore, five ailment/disease categories obtained a 100% fidelity level. This result indicates that the plants used for that disease category are considered the most preferred species. Respiratory diseases obtained the highest FIC value of 0.40, indicating species within that category are the best candidates to search for bioactive compounds. This documentation provides the first checklist of useful plants in Camiguin island and will serve as a basis for future ethnobotanical studies in the Philippines.

",,,,"Anthropogenic climate change is causing a severe impact on the survival of organisms (Brondizio et al., 2019; Shukla et al., 2019). Climate is one of the major drivers of species distributions, and the velocity at which the current climate is changing, owing to human activities, already induces a redistribution of life on Earth at an unprecedented speed, especially in the oceans where marine life is shifting towards the poles six times faster than the velocity at which terrestrial life is shifting poleward on land (Lenoir et al., 2020). Besides, biodiversity redistribution may enhance climate warming through positive feedback loops (e.g., the shrubification of the Arctic altering the surface albedo), thus indirectly affecting human well-being (Pecl et al., 2017). For this reason, both essential climate variables (ECVs) and essential biodiversity variables (EBVs) have been developed as proxies for the early detection of climate change and biodiversity redistribution (Bojinski et al., 2014; Pereira et al., 2013; Schmeller et al., 2018). Worldwide, organizations have tried building research and policy networks to seriously face the problem, or, at least, to build robust projections that might allow the monitoring of future changes. One of the main examples is the Group on Earth Observation (GEO, https://www.earthobservations.org/index.php), namely a global partnership of governments and organizations to develop a Global Earth Observation System of Systems (GEOSS, https://www.earthobservations.org/geoss.php). A specific branch of GEO – GEO BON (https://geobon.org) – is devoted to the development of suitable EBVs as proxies for improving the effectiveness of biodiversity conservation over the entire planet. The 22 proposed EBVs are trying to cover several aspects of diversity, clumped into six classes: (i) genetic composition (e.g., co-ancestry, allelic diversity); (ii) species populations (e.g., species distribution, population abundance); (iii) species traits (e.g., phenology, morphology); (iv) community composition (e.g., taxonomic diversity, functional diversity, species interactions); (v) ecosystem function (e.g., net primary productivity, nutrient retention); and (vi) ecosystem structure (e.g., habitat structure, extent and fragmentation) (Pereira et al., 2013; see also https://geobon.org/ebvs/what-are-ebvs/). Variables useful for the research fields at the interface of ecology and climate sciences might include, among the others: (i) species occurrence detection and plant traits (e.g., leaf area and leaf nitrogen content) based on multispectral and hyperspectral data; (ii) plant canopy height and biomass based on light detection and ranging (LiDAR) data (see, e.g., the Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation mission [GEDI, https://gedi.umd.edu/]); and (iii) habitat fragmentation and land-cover change (LCC) data based on time series of Landsat images (Skidmore et al., 2015). A common language between the remote sensing community, on the one hand, and the ecological and climate research communities, on the other, was definitively defined by the proposal of ecosystem-based EBVs that can be transposed from field observations to remotely-sensed perspectives. A key concept is the reinforcement of the link between ecological patterns to be observed and a direct relationship with potential ecological processes shaping them. For instance, spatial heterogeneity in biophysical conditions might represent a good proxy of ecological variation over space and can be related to several ecological processes, from habitat fragmentation to niche variability, to biodiversity (Hernandez-Stefanoni et al., 2012). From this point of view, requirements explicitly expressed by the communities of ecologists and climate scientists towards the community of remote sensing specialists include the availability of different spatial grains as well as several meaningful wavelengths to further process remotely-sensed data and perform global-scale analyses (Randin et al., 2020; Schmeller et al., 2018). In the era of big data, such accomplishments can be reached in a simple manner, overall when the community of ecologists and climate scientists is directly asked to provide technical advances about the development of current and future sensors (e.g., https://sentinel.esa.int/web/sentinel/events). A knowledge gap is still open about the possibility to monitor genetic composition (see the first EBVs' class described above) and variation over space by using remote sensing data products. Some studies have already demonstrated the feasibility of using remotely-sensed and geographic data for studying population genetic variability (see Vernesi et al., 2012). From this point of view, proxy indicators might represent an effective method to bridge the gap between remotely-sensed and field-based observations on genetic diversity. However, the relationship between genetic diversity and the ecological space appears to be too complex to be directly faced with remote sensing proxies, since it is dependent on too many factors like demographic history, population genetics, environmental management, gene flow, spatial barriers, and so forth (Bruford et al., 2017). Climate projections are critical for ensuring a proper management of ecosystems in light of past and recent changes. Gathering field observations of meteorological data worldwide with a high temporal resolution (e.g., daily or hourly data) and at a fine spatial resolution (i.e., microclimate) might not be affordable from a logistical and cost-effective perspective. However, there are promising attempts such as the recent SoilTemp initiative (Lembrechts et al., 2020), to gather detailed micrometeorological data at a global scale. Hence, remote sensing might represent a powerful tool for providing important covariates to interpolate scattered field observations of micrometeorological data worldwide and thus spatialize micrometeorological and microclimatic conditions from satellite images as well as forecasting future scenarios on climate change at an unprecedented spatio-temporal resolution (Lembrechts & Lenoir, 2020; Maclean, 2020). As an example, satellite data, using NASA Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI), have been used to monitor air quality in the Galapagos Islands, providing for the first time baseline levels of air contaminants in one of the most important and vulnerable biodiversity hotspots on Earth (Cazorla & Herrera, 2020). Additionally, long time series on temperature as a proxy of climate change have been generated deriving land surface temperature (LST) layers with different levels of spatial resolution, from coarse at 5 km (e.g., MODIS, https://terra.nasa.gov/about/terra-instruments/modis, Figure 1) and 4 km (GOES network, https://www.nasa.gov/content/goes) to fine at 10 m (Sentinel, https://sentinel.esa.int/web/sentinel/missions) or 30 m (Landsat, https://landsat.gsfc.nasa.gov/) through intermediate at 1 km (Envisat, https://earth.esa.int/web/guest/missions/esa-operational-eo-missions/envisat). Similarly, these layers can be derived at different levels of temporal resolutions, from monthly to daily basis (see Tomlinson et al., 2011 for a review). Examples showed the feasibility of predicting trends in climatic conditions by remote sensing from medium (e.g., Metz et al., 2014) to very fine (e.g., Lenoir et al., 2017; Zellweger et al., 2019) spatial resolutions. Such trends have been demonstrated to rule out a number of ecological processes such as follows: (i) species dispersal (Bellier et al., 2012); (ii) biological invasions (Gallien et al., 2010); and (iii) habitat loss (Bartel & Sexton, 2009). This is especially true considering that species facing habitat fragmentation are generally less resistant to additional and detrimental effects related to climate change (Travis, 2003). From this perspective, aerial photography dating back to the 50s can help classifying landscape (Rocchini & Ricotta, 2007) and linking multi-temporal land-use changes to current climate change estimated from satellite imagery (Gillespie et al., 2008). Furthermore, global remote sensing products are now able to track climate change trends from above, with a high repetition rate, up to four global images per day at a spatial resolution of a few kilometres (Wan, 2008), such as the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) land surface temperature/emissivity product. From a monitoring perspective, trend analysis can now be affordable using satellite data, since long time series are now available. Satellite remote sensing has long been a core part of the World Meteorological Organization (WMO, https://public.wmo.int/en) to provide estimates of cloud cover and motion vectors, atmospheric and surface temperature as well as snow and ice cover starting from the 80s (Leese, 1987), under the flag of the World Weather Watch Programme (https://www.wmo.int/). Such data can now be combined to provide complete time series of intra- and inter-annual weather and climate changes to find potentially severe impacts on biodiversity. Furthermore, the Copernicus program (https://www.copernicus.eu/) – coordinated and managed by the European Commission and implemented with Member States, the European Space Agency (ESA), the European Organization for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites (EUMETSAT), and the European Center Medium Weather Forecast (ECMWF) – is now providing worldwide scale estimates of different Earth variables related to both ecosystem properties (e.g., leaf area index, fraction of green vegetation cover, burnt areas) as well as energy (e.g., top of canopy reflectance, surface albedo) climatic-related layers (e.g., LST, cryosphere, snow cover), including different sensors like the Proba-V and the MODIS sensors. Furthermore, global estimates of climatic variables are now available under Copernicus at an hourly basis. As an example, global LST product on an hourly basis is now available from the geostationary constellation (https://land.copernicus.eu/global/products/lst). Moreover, the Copernicus initiative promoted the launch of Sentinel satellites, with a very high revisit time, up to 5 days, a high spatial resolution (10 m, a reasonably high spatial resolution for free data) and the possibility to gather free sets until 2028 (Skidmore et al., 2015). This is dramatically useful for the ecology community since it allows to study local as well as global processes under a free analysis environment, ensuring that all researchers over the globe can perform their studies in a reproducible manner. This is especially important in those countries where research funds are low but the habitats to be preserved are extremely important for the whole planet (e.g., African and South-American tropical forests) and the related threats like deforestation or fire spread should be constantly monitored. Besides, airborne remote sensing helps predict microclimatic conditions at a very detailed spatial grain based on both hyperspectral remote sensing and LiDAR laser scanning (Zellweger et al., 2019). While hyperspectral images allow seeing ecosystems in spectral wavelengths in which there might be peaks related to microclimate change, LiDAR images can be used to track structural changes in vegetation cover strictly related to microclimate dynamics (Lenoir et al., 2017; Zellweger et al., 2020). For instance, airborne LiDAR and hyperspectral imagery have already been combined to derive gap and canopy properties and model forest microclimate dynamics of the Frame Wood New Forest in southern England (Latif & Blackburn, 2008). Such applications of airborne remote sensing technologies to model microclimate at very high spatial resolution have the potential to inform species distribution models about potential microrefugia for species to persist locally under anthropogenic climate change (Lembrechts et al., 2019; Lenoir et al., 2017). LiDAR data have also been successfully used to track local spots of sudden changes in meteorological conditions like local turbulence (Hon & Chan, 2020; Wildmann et al., 2019), wind radial velocity (Frehlich et al., 1997), wake vortices characteristics (Holzapfel et al., 2003), and hub height ocean winds (Hasager et al., 2013). Modelling such meteorological spot-events is important since they can – as well as longer temporal dynamics like climate change – alter ecosystem functioning in a very short period of time, leading to devastating changes threatening organism survival and challenging ecosystem resilience, until the potential loss of single species and entire habitats. Remote sensing products provide cutting-edge technology to support the interdisciplinarity research between ecology and climate sciences. Besides, a number of free and open-source packages and software modules have been recently developed to relate remotely-sensed data from both disciplines. Several of these packages are freely available under the R statistical software (R Core Team, 2020), like, for example, the rasterdiv package to track diversity and climate changes from space (Marcantonio et al., 2020), the climate package to download in situ meteorological data (Czernecki et al., 2020), the ClimInd package to compute climate indices (Reig-Gracia et al., 2019), the hsdar and the lidR packages to manage and analyse hyperspectral and LiDAR data, respectively (Lehnert et al., 2020; Roussel et al., 2020), the RStoolbox to analyse remote sensing data (Leutner et al., 2019). Numerical weather prediction is far from being free from uncertainty, considering both weather and climate modelling. The physics of forecasting are well grounded on robust equation sets (Abbe, 1901), and the steps to represent physical processes by ensemble models are known. On the other hand, mapping errors is crucial to get an estimate of the bias beside the estimated variables (Rocchini et al., 2013). Examples exist to implement such maps dating back to the 50s based on both error growing models (Thompson, 1957) and chaos theory (Lorenz, 2006). The basic idea is that any forecast is strictly related to boundary conditions (including, e.g., emission scenarios) and is sensitive to error propagation (Pijanowski et al., 2011) and non-stationarity in the spatial distribution of errors (Foody, 2004; Gillespie et al., 2008). Care must then be taken in meteorological and climatic modelling applied to the prediction of ecological processes, in order to avoid the propagation of errors in final models due to the initialization of the climatic forecasts. The use of remote sensing in cross-disciplinary research between ecology and climate is still at its infancy and a very promising frontier research for cross-disciplinary research between ecology and climate sciences. In the past, it was considered as a cutting-edge technology for forecasts and modelling of ecological functions related to climatic drivers, like nutrient cycling and energy flow. However, over time, researchers realized there are still challenges to be faced before such tools can be considered a robust throughput standard. Such challenges might concern, for instance, technical issues, such as spatial grain (resolution, sensu; Dungan et al., 2002). A very high spatial resolution would add noise instead of information into the model, while a coarse spatial resolution will create smoothed surfaces, which are definitively useless for further ecological modelling (Nagendra & Rocchini, 2008). Furthermore, high data volumes and computational needs should be faced once dealing with any meteorological or climatic observations, especially across wide spatial extents and at a high temporal resolution (Li et al., 2017). From this point of view, a number of initiatives are now worldwide devoted to promote cloud computing as a frontier for collaborative cyberinfrastructure development. Examples include the NASA projects ADAPT (https://www.nccs.nasa.gov/systems/adapt), Goddard Private Cloud (https://www.nas.nasa.gov/SC18/demos/demo34.html), and SMCE (https://www.nccs.nasa.gov/systems/SMCE) to virtualize, by high-performance throughput techniques, unprecedented big data gathering and analysis and leverage data-intensive calculus. Finally, the reduction of the uncertainty of physical parameterization is another important issue (Bauer et al., 2015) to build a robust empirical framework for further modelling of ecological changes, by guaranteeing that the complex geospatial models rely on (at least, potentially) unbiased data. Given the above drawbacks and challenges, remote sensing is now providing useful data guaranteeing efficient monitoring of ecological processes to be linked with meteorological and climatic variables, to enable scientists and practitioners from climate and ecological sciences to work together. The forthcoming ""Climate Science for Ecological Forecasting Symposium"" will be the first interdisciplinary conference between climate and ecology, jointly hosted by the Royal Meteorological Society and British Ecological Society. Together, attendees will explore the needs and opportunities for greater interaction between the disciplines and establish the cross-disciplinary networks that are necessary to better predict and plan the future of our planet.

To investigate spatial variations in the ecological trait structure of breeding bird assemblages on oceanic islands. To test the hypothesis that native and naturalized alien bird species are filtered by different processes, leading to diverging associations between traits and insular environmental gradients.

Location
Oceanic islands worldwide.

Time Period
Current.

Major Taxa Studied
Terrestrial breeding birds.

Methods
We assessed the composition of breeding terrestrial bird assemblages from the extent-of-occurrence maps of 3170 native and 169 naturalized alien species on 4660 oceanic islands. We quantified their ecological trait structures with respect to diet, mobility and body mass as the standardized distance between a mean pairwise trait distance index and its expectation from a null model. We used spatial generalized additive models to relate trait structures to proxies of environmental conditions and human impact on land, accounting for all species, native species only and alien species only.

Results
Diet and mobility traits tended to be more diverse than expected by a null model, while body mass tended towards clustering. Trait-environment associations were idiosyncratic, but environmental variables tended to explain trait structures better than human impacts on habitats. Islands invaded by alien species had similar trait structures as noninvaded ones, although they hosted assemblages with more clustered body masses. However, trait-environment relationships diverged when considering all islands and all species, invaded islands only or alien species only.

Main Conclusions
Despite their ecosystem-level influences, alien species have a limited effect on the global patterns of trait structures in the breeding bird assemblages of the world's islands, either because they account for a low proportion of species or because successful invaders and native species have similar trait suites. Trait-environment associations suggest that filters related to the conditions of alien species' introductions explain their distributions in island assemblages better than the constraints associated with isolated environments.","1466-822X

","Lucieer, Arko; Robinson, Sharon; Turner, Darren",,Aerial photography; Aerial Survey,,,2010.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Polar regions are experiencing rapid and severe climatic shifts with major changes in temperature, wind speed and UV-B radiation already observed in Antarctica. Since vegetation is isolated to the coastal fringe and climatic records only extend back 50 years, with limited spatial resolution, we urgently need new proxies to determine if coastal climate has changed over the past century. In a manner similar to trees, old growth mosses also preserve a climate record along their shoots. Our ability to accurately date these mosses and map their extent in sufficient spatial detail means that, for the first time, mosses can be used as sentinels to provide crucial information on how the Antarctic coastal climate has changed over past centuries and how biota has responded to these changes. The spatial scale of the moss beds (tens of m2) makes satellite imagery (even very high resolution imagery of 0.5 m) unsuitable for mapping their extent in sufficient detail. Due to logistical constraints aerial photography is impractical. Recent developments in the use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) for remote sensing applications provide exciting new opportunities for ultra-high resolution mapping and monitoring of the environment. In this study, we developed a UAV consisting of a remote controlled helicopter carrying three different cameras: visible colour, near-infrared, and thermal infrared for cost-effective, efficient, and ultra-high resolution mapping of terrestrial vegetation in the Windmill Islands, Antarctica. These three sensors allow us to map different physical characteristics of the moss beds at resolutions of several centimetres. This paper and presentation will address the issues encountered in developing a UAV system, discuss the different UAV sensors and components, and demonstrate how this system can be applied in these fragile remote polar ecosystems.",,,,,,,,,,,,No,,,,"trait, struct, ?",,"baseline, protocol",0.9908114075660706,1,0.0068785973521332386,1.0,5,605.0

",,,,"The genus Limia is endemic to the Greater Antilles with a single species in Cuba, Limia vittata, widespread in lowland ecosystems. The limited data available regarding its population structure suggest that its levels of intraspecific divergence are lower compared to other Cuban poeciliids. Furthermore, little is known about the dispersal pathways and demographic changes experienced by present-day populations. By analysing two mitochondrial markers and testing scenarios of dispersal and vicariance, we provide insights into the evolutionary history of L. vittata. Here, we show that this species is formed by three genetically differentiated and geographically delimited groups of populations. We also found moderate intraspecific divergence and a mtDNA pattern of high haplotype diversity and low nucleotide diversity which is consistent with a rapid demographic expansion. Our Bayesian analysis recovered dispersal from eastern to western Cuba as the most likely scenario explaining the current distribution of this species. Limia vittata exhibited a distinct regional distribution of haplogroups that corresponds to major core landmasses within Cuba, along with a signature of rapid population expansion during relatively recent palaeoclimatic changes that occurred during the formation of the archipelago. Similar phylogeographic patterns have been identified in other freshwater and terrestrial taxa on the island.","0024-4066

",,,,"Abstract Aim Species distributions across islands are shaped by dispersal limitations, environmental filters and biotic interactions but the relative influence of each of these processes has rarely been assessed. Here, we examine the relative contributions of island characteristics, marine subsidies, species traits, and species interactions on avian community composition. Location Central Coast region of British Columbia, Canada. Taxon Terrestrial breeding birds. Methods We observed 3610 individuals of 32 bird species on 89 islands that spanned multiple orders of magnitude in area (0.0002–3 km 2 ). We fit a spatially explicit joint species distribution model to estimate the relative contributions of island physical characteristics, island‐specific inputs of marine subsidies, species' traits, and biotic interactions on species distributions. Biogeographic characteristics included island area, isolation, and habitat heterogeneity, while marine influence was represented by forest‐edge soil δ 15 N, wrack biomass, shoreline substrate, and distance to shore. This approach also allowed us to estimate how much variation in distributions resulted from species' biological traits (i.e. body mass, feeding guild, feeding height, and nesting height). Results Bird species distributions were determined almost equivalently by island biogeographic characteristics (23.5% of variation explained) and marine influence (24.8%). We detected variation in species‐specific responses to both island biogeographic characteristics and marine influence, but no significant effect of any biological trait examined. Additionally, we found evidence that habitat preferences were a more important driver than competitive interactions. Main Conclusions Although most island biogeographic studies focus only on islands' physical characteristics, we found evidence for an equivalent role of marine subsidy in structuring island bird communities. Our study suggests that for small islands, disentangling the effects of island biogeographic characteristics, marine inputs, and biotic interactions is a useful next step in understanding species distributions.

",,,,"We analyzed changes in abundance of terrestrial birds on St. John, U.S. Virgin Islands, for a 32 year period during which 3 major hurricanes occurred. Using 1987 as a baseline year, because it followed a 27 year hiatus when no major hurricanes hit the island, we assessed the impact of hurricanes on vegetation structure and bird populations. Bird abundance was determined for 25 m radius circular plots that were surveyed each year of the study along the same transects. Percent cover of trees, shrubs, and herbs was measured in each plot in 1987, 1990, and 2019. All of the survey plots were in moist forest or dry woodland in Virgin Islands National Park. Of 13 common birds, 5 did not show marked and consistent declines in abundance following hurricanes even though the structure of vegetation on the island was heavily modified by storms. Three of these species are insectivores. Seven species declined or showed habitat shifts following Hurricane Hugo in 1989, but 5 of these populations subsequently increased and most recovered to close to their 1987 abundance during the 1990s. Six of these 7 species also declined or showed habitat shifts following Hurricanes Irma and Maria in 2017. The most marked declines in the aftermath of hurricanes in both 1989 and 2017 were for frugivores and nectarivores, especially hummingbirds. Most common bird species in Virgin Islands National Park were either resistant to the effects of severe hurricanes or resilient in the decade following a hurricane. However, more research is needed to assess the status of vulnerable species such as hummingbirds and rare resident species (Bridled Quail-Dove [Geotrygon mystacea] and Puerto Rican Flycatcher [Myiarchus antillarum]).

",,,,"Coastal interface is the most active in the global element cycling, linking the terrestrial and ocean ecosystem. However, little attention is paid to the ecological risk of multiple heavy metals (HMs) residues in tropical coastal soil and its relationships with human activities. Here, 199 coastal topsoils were collected from the eastern Hainan Island of China in 2021. Furthermore, the pollution characteristics, spatial distribution, and ecological risk of eight HMs were evaluated. The results showed that the mean contents of eight HMs were in the order of Cr (47.96 mg·kg−1) > Zn (40.93 mg·kg−1) > Pb (21.28 mg·kg−1) > Cu (14.89 mg·kg−1) > Ni (8.67 mg·kg−1) > As (5.64 mg·kg−1) > Cd (0.06 mg·kg−1) > Hg (0.05 mg·kg−1). These HMs contents were larger than the soil background values of Hainan Province, indicating the accumulation risk. Based on the Nemerow integrated pollution index, the sample sites with moderate and severe pollution accounted for 28.5% and 28.0%, respectively. In contrast, the sum of sites with no and slight pollution was only 10%. The ecological risk assessment revealed that 25% and 5% of sites displayed moderate or extreme ecological risks with the mean RI value larger than 90, and As and Cd were the most dangerous HMs. Spatially, the pollution hotspots of Zn, Pb, Cd and Hg were distributed in the middle urban of the study area and the dense road network in the west, while that of Cr, Ni, and Cu were distributed in the woodland in the northeast and southwest. The pollution hotspots of As were distributed in northeast cropland. The PMF model further indicated that the largest contributor to Zn, Pb, and Cd were the combined sources of traffic and agricultural activities, accounting for 55.66%, 56.30%, and 55.36%, respectively. Soil parent materials contributed to the Cr, Ni, and Cu, accounting for 77.1%, 58.4%, and 38.2%, respectively. Coal combustion was the main source of Hg, accounting for 81.3%, while agricultural activities accounted for 80.8% of the As in the soils. Overall, anthropogenic activities (63.60%) were the main source for HMs residues in the studied coastal soils, but the contribution of soil parent materials (36.40%) could not be neglected.

",,,,"Worldwide, most crested penguin species (Eudyptes spp.) are in decline. New Zealand's subantarctic Antipodes Islands are of international significance for erect-crested (Eudyptes sclateri) and rockhopper (Eudyptes filholi) penguins.
Between 1995 and 2011, a 23% decline was recorded in the two penguin species on the Antipodes Islands. In October 2014, nest abundance counts on Antipodes Island were undertaken to determine if this decline was continuing, particularly in light of a significant storm event that hit the Antipodes area in January 2014 causing massive landslides during the penguin breeding season.
All penguin colonies ground counted in 2011 were preferentially ground counted in 2014 or, if time or weather did not allow, were checked with binoculars to confirm colony presence or absence.
Seventy-three per cent of the colonies and the equivalent of 82% of all nests counted in 2011 were recounted in 2014. Overall, there was a 19% decline in erect-crested penguin nests between 2011 and 2014. Rockhopper penguins showed a slight increase (2.6%).
Landslides affected 11% of the main islands’ land area and 44% of surveyed nesting colonies. Erect-crested penguin colonies with approximately 75% or greater of their area impacted by landslides showed a significantly greater decline than unaffected or only partially impacted colonies. Landslides showed a minimal effect on rockhopper nest numbers.
There continues to be a significant decline of erect-crested penguins at the Antipodes Islands. An increasing occurrence of extreme weather events are predicted with climate change and have the potential to increase land-based flooding and landslides, adding additional impacts to terrestrial breeding marine species. Greater understanding of what is causing erect-crested penguin decline is needed to prevent this endangered species from extinction.","1052-7613

We also analyzed structure and composition of the woody vegetation in Abaco’s two widespread terrestrial habitats: Pineland, an open woodland of Pinus caribaea var. bahamensis (Bahamas Pine) that covers most of the island; and Coppice, a broadleaf, relatively diverse forest that covers <10% of Abaco. Winter resident birds were more abundant in Pineland (8.61 individuals/point) than in Coppice (2.28 individuals/point). Setophaga palmarum (Palm Warbler) and S. coronata (Yellow-rumped Warbler) dominated the winter bird communities in Pineland (44.6% and 37.4% of all detected individuals, respectively), with the next three most common species (S. discolor [Prairie Warbler], Dumetella carolinensis [Gray Catbird], and Geothlypis trichas [Common Yellowthroat]) ranging from 6.5 to 2.0%. The winter species composition in Coppice was more even than in Pineland, featuring S. ruticilla [American Redstart] (39.8%), Prairie Warbler (16.2%), Gray Catbird (13.1%), and the next five most common species (S. americana [Northern Parula], Seiurus aurocapillus [Ovenbird], S. caerulescens [Black-throated Blue Warbler], Mnio- tilta varia [Black-and-white Warbler], and S. citrina [Hooded Warbler]) ranging from 7.3 to 3.1%. In Pineland, bird community composition varied with overstory cover and height, understory cover and type, and ground cover. In contrast, patterns of bird community composition in Coppice were not associated strongly with variation in habitat structure or forest composition. This may reflect that Coppice, experiencing frequent hurricane disturbance, has considerable small-scale heterogeneity in the availability of food for winter resident birds. Comparing our data with those from previous surveys of winter birds conducted 5–40 years earlier in the northern Bahamas, we see little evidence of major changes in this bird community.",,,,,,,,,,,,No,,,,"pop, struct, com, trait",,rep,0.9951764106750488,1,0.0020792613725797333,1.0,5,432.0

gathered from field measurements has been used to fit the Chapman-Richards growth
function to predict the volume and biomass increment of Gmelina arborea and Swietenia
macrophylla tree farms until they reached their respective rotation ages. Biomass and
carbon density values are found to vary with age, type of species, site conditions and
silvicultural treatments applied in the stand. Although differences in year when the trees
were planted had no relation with its soil carbon storage, this pool had greater storage
capacity than the above-ground biomass and roots. The average maximum growth was
attained after 10 years for G. arborea and 13 years for S. macrophylla. Volume growth started
to slow down when the tree species reached almost half its rotation age. The same trend was
observed for the biomass and carbon density of each farm. The maximum mean annual
increment of both species was attained before the expected maximum growth year. Growth
increment decreased as the species reached their rotation age. The total C storage capacity of

We surveyed Toxoplasma seroprevalence in koala (Phascolarctos cinereus) populations on the island and on the mainland and assessed their risk of infection and their role in the life cycle of Toxoplasma. All screened koalas from the island (n = 94) and the mainland (n = 63) were seronegative. This represents the largest Toxoplasma seroprevalence survey in this species and provided sufficient evidence to confidently demonstrate freedom from parasite exposure in both island and mainland populations at the time of the survey. Because koalas are extensively arboreal and predominately consume tree foliage, they appear to be at negligible risk of Toxoplasma infection.

Iberian Peninsula is one of the regions with the greatest diversity of ecosystems in European continent. It is therefore an excellent study area for monitoring phenological dynamics of vegetation. The aim of this study is to analyse the spatial variability of the phenology of the vegetation of the Iberian Peninsula and Balearic Islands for the period 2001-2017. NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) time series were generated from the surface reflectance product MOD09Q1 at a spatial resolution of 250 meters and with a composite period of 8 days. Atmospheric disturbances and noise were reduced using a Savitzky-Golay smoothing filter. Different phenological metrics or phenometrics were extracted using a threshold-based method. Results showed the existence of a different behaviour between spring and autumn phenophases in the Atlantic and Mediterranean biogeographic regions. The Mediterranean mountainous areas showed a similar phenological behaviour to the Atlantic vegetation. Biogeographic regions showed an internal variability, which may be derived from the different behaviour of land covers (e.g., natural vegetation vs. crops).

",,,,"The late Quaternary is characterized by the extinction of many terrestrial megafauna, which included tortoises (Family: Testudinidae). However, limited information is available on how extinction shaped the phenotype of surviving taxa. Here, based on a global dataset of straight carapace length, we investigate the temporal variation, spatial distribution and evolution of tortoise body size over the past 23 million years, thereby capturing the effects of Quaternary extinctions in this clade. We found a significant change in body size distribution characterized by a reduction of both mean body size and maximum body size of extant tortoises relative to fossil taxa. This reduction of body size occurred earlier in mainland (Early Pleistocene 2.588–0.781 Ma) than in island tortoises (Late Pleistocene/Holocene 0.126–0 Ma). Despite contrasting body size patterns between fossil and extant taxa on a spatial scale, tortoise body size showed limited variation over time until this decline. Body size is a fundamental functional trait determining many aspects of species ecologies, with large tortoises playing key roles as ecosystem engineers. As such, the transition from larger sized to smaller sized classes indicated by our findings likely resulted in the homogenization of tortoises' ecological functions and diminished the role of tortoises in structuring the vegetation community.

",,,,"Abstract Different theories have been proposed to explain the phenotypic changes observed in island lineages, but it remains unclear if predictable evolutionary trajectories can be identified within island communities. Using a 3D functional space approach, we tested whether insular endemic species tend to evolve towards apparent holes in niche space (expecting niche filling) or tend to become generalists, that is, moving towards the centre of the functional space (expecting niche expansion). We tested these two hypotheses in 378 insular endemic species from 24 islands of 8 archipelagos, including 177 prehistoric anthropogenically extinct species. Analyses were conducted with and without accounting for species size difference. We found that 57% of island endemic species evolved towards more unoccupied regions of the global morphospace (i.e. more distinct body sizes compared to the ones of their ancestors), suggesting a tendency for niche filling. When adjusted traits for body size, we found that half of the endemic species (50%) showed more distinct trait values than their ancestors. Results also revealed that certain dietary niches (terrestrial herbivores and nectarivores) evolved distinct body sizes more frequently. Differences noted between islands and archipelagos suggest that biogeographic factors may influence evolutionary trajectory and interactions between these two hypotheses. Our study confirms that extinct species occupied specific niches that have been left vacant, suggesting that these evolutionary ‘oddities’ could be more sensitive to extinction. Overall, it calls for a global assessment of the avian functional diversity lost from recent extinctions. Read the free Plain Language Summary for this article on the Journal blog.

",,,,"We evaluated N dynamics on a climate gradient on old (> 4 million year) basaltic substrate on the Island of Kaua'i, Hawai'i, to evaluate the utility of pedogenic thresholds and soil process domains for understanding N cycling in terrestrial ecosystems. Studies of nitrogen dynamics on the climate gradient on a younger basaltic substrate (~ 150,000 year) had found a good match between soil process domains and N cycling processes. Here we measured net N mineralization and nitrification by incubation, and δ15N of total soil N, to determine whether the soil process domains on the older gradient were equally useful for interpreting N cycling and thereby to explore the general utility of the approach. Net N mineralization varied from 0 to 1.7 mg kg-1 d-1 across the old Kaua'i gradient, and δ15N varied from + 3 to + 11 ο/οο, both ranges similar to those on the younger substrate. However, while the pattern of variation with climate was similar for δ15N, the highest rates of mineralization on the old gradient occurred where forests were dominated by the native N fixer Acacia koa. This occurred in sites wetter than the process domain associated with high net N mineralization on the gradient on younger substrate. We conclude that soil process domains based on rock-derived nutrients are not always useful for evaluating N dynamics, especially where the distribution of biological N fixers is controlled by factors other than rock-derived nutrients.

",,,,"Vegetation structural complexity has been identified as a vital factor for forest ecosystem function, stability, and resilience. However, agricultural land with much reduced structural complexity has largely replaced natural forests in the tropics. Therefore, restoring structural complexity in large-scale plantation monocultures by introducing agroforestry systems may counteract the loss of biodiversity and ecosystem functions. However, we still have limited knowledge of how the structural complexity of agroforests develops under different restoration treatments. We established a large-scale biodiversity enrichment experiment in a conventional monoculture oil palm plantation in Sumatra, Indonesia. In this experiment, agroforests were implemented by planting clusters of native trees (""tree islands"") within the oil palm plantation, systematically varying initially planted tree richness ranging from 0–6 (0 corresponding to natural regeneration only) and plot area (25–1600 m2). We tested the effect of the experimental treatments on nine years of the development of local structural complexity using a stand structural complexity index (SSCI) derived from terrestrial laser scanning. We found that tree planting and natural regeneration treatments promoted structural complexity by creating denser and more complex vegetation structures. Plots with a tree planting treatment tended to show greater structural complexity than plots with natural regeneration only. However, during the study period, oil palms still dominated heights, and the temporal change in structural complexity among plots with or without a tree planting treatment did not differ. As for plot area, our results indicate that structural complexity looking from the center of plots did not necessarily depend on the area during the study period, and even small tree islands can increase local structural complexity in a monoculture oil palm plantation. Initially planted tree richness did not significantly affect the development of structural complexity. Nine years after establishment, not planted trees but regenerated woody plants strongly positively affected vegetation density and structural complexity. Our findings highlight that sustaining vegetation density below oil palm canopies is a key strategy to increase the structural complexity of oil palm landscapes.

Detailed information on soil properties is necessary to evaluate current soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks, as well as past and projected carbon stock changes. Currently, the most complete dataset of global soils is the Harmonized World Soil Database (HWSD), which was updated to version 2.0 in 2023. From the HWSD, it is possible to derive a map of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) major soil types (high activity clay (HAC), low activity clay (LAC), volcanic, sandy, spodic, wetland, and organic soils) that can be used to calculate country reference SOC stocks using the default reference SOC stock values from the IPCC guidelines for national greenhouse gas (GHG) inventories. Following the update of the HWSD, an updated 1-kilometer resolution global map of the distribution of the seven IPCC major soil types, derived from the HWSD v2.0, is presented. When comparing the IPCC major soil types maps derived from HWSD v2.0 and HWSD v1.2, it appears that 18 % of the land areas are differently classified. Changes are mostly located in northern latitudes and small islands states. They are attributable to a change in the classification of soils, from FAO90 and FAO74 classes in the HWSD v1.2 to WRB classes in the HWSD v2.0, and an extended coverage of coastal areas and small islands. These same changes lead to an average difference in country reference SOC stocks of around 3 % when comparing Tier 1 country reference SOC stocks derived from the HWSD v1.2 and v2.0.

","Norton, David; Young, Laura; Clarkson, Bruce",,Section (typography); Special section,,,2016.0,,,168,169,,,,,,17,3,"Ecological Management & Restoration
",,"Wiley
",,,,"Despite only 800 years of human occupation, New Zealand has suffered from a rate and scale of ecosystem transformation and species extinction rarely matched elsewhere. However, New Zealand's biodiversity is on the cusp of a major recovery because of the variety of restoration initiatives currently underway and of groups implementing them, and because of new cutting-edge national scale projects that have just been announced. In this introduction, we briefly discuss what makes restoration in New Zealand distinctive, review the contributions to this Ecological Management & Restoration special section and highlight other aspects of restoration in New Zealand. New Zealand has one of the highest proportions of land managed solely for nature conservation of any country (8.6 million ha or 33% of the land area), with this land managed by one government agency, the Department of Conservation. While the area of conservation land is large, it is not representative of the original diversity because the majority is concentrated in the mountains and uplands. Furthermore, New Zealand's biota has been decimated by the impacts of invasive species. New Zealand was the last major land mass to be settled by humans (ca. 1280 A.D.), and apart from some smaller islands (e.g. Hawai'i), nowhere else has the rate of invasions and their impacts been so high. Our endemic birds best characterise this decimation: nearly one quarter (21%) of all bird species (263 species including terrestrial, freshwater and marine) resident at the time of human settlement are extinct, while 81% of the remaining species are directly threatened with or at risk of extinction. Primary production is the main land use across the remaining two thirds of New Zealand, with sheep and beef farms, plantation forests and dairy farms covering three-quarters of this. Within landscapes favoured for agriculture, the scale of ecological decline has been dramatic. For example, of the three million ha of the Canterbury plains and downs, less than 0.1% still contains remnants of the original vegetation. A unique feature of New Zealand is the central role that indigenous Māori have in both society and land management. Notwithstanding signing the Treaty of Waitangi with the British Crown in 1840 guaranteeing them the undisputed chieftainship of their lands and resources, Māori were marginalised and had most of their lands and resources wrongfully taken. Although not perfect, a process to rectify Treaty violations has been in place since 1975 and has led to substantial settlements with individual iwi (tribes) that have gone someway towards redressing past injustices, including the return of land, legal recognition of mana (authority, prestige) over land, access to resources, co-management and financial settlements amongst other things. This process has led to Māori today having substantial ownership and say in natural resource management, especially biodiversity conservation. In addition, many legal statutes now specifically recognise the principles of the Treaty of Waitangi and require those implementing them (especially government agencies) to take these into account. In New Zealand, almost all conservation work is restorative and encompasses a continuum of activities including restoration of degraded ecosystems such as abandoned farmland, removal of pests and reintroduction of locally extinct fauna. In New Zealand, the words conservation and restoration are used interchangeably and both are as much about inclusion of people as they are about the biophysical. This is well articulated in the Māori proverb: Toitū te marae a Tāne, Toitū te marae a Tangaroa, Toitū te Iwi (which in effect means ‘When the land and water are sustained, the people will prosper’). Central to the interdependency between people and the environment has been the concept of adaptive management. The magnitude of the biodiversity crisis in New Zealand is such that management is often implemented before the hard science is undertaken. This adaptive management approach is not unique to New Zealand, but has been essential and highly successful here and has led to some outstanding conservation successes (e.g. the recovery of the Black Robin, Petroica traversi, from the brink of extinction with all birds today descended from one female). This special section has been assembled to celebrate the first joint meeting between the Australasian chapter of the Society for Ecological Restoration and the New Zealand Ecological Society. These six articles are by no means exhaustive, and a wide range of other exciting restoration initiatives also exist. Nevertheless, we provide a summary of the current position of restoration in New Zealand across a range of ecosystems and approaches. In the opening paper Norton et al. emphasise that if we are to make meaningful progress in restoring New Zealand's biological heritage by 2050, a range of fundamental issues need to be addressed. These relate not just to restoration science but also to building resilience in the wider socio-economic and cultural context within which restoration occurs. With nearly 90% of the population living in urban centres, urban restoration has been expanding rapidly in New Zealand; Clarkson and Kirby review the history and current state of urban restoration and highlight some constraints and opportunities for the future. Many lowland lakes have become degraded as a result of agricultural intensification and invasive species. Hamilton et al. emphasise the role of catchment restoration and in-lake interventions to improve lake condition touching on the challenges posed by climate change and invasive species. Reducing the abundance of introduced predators to allow native fauna to flourish has been a central theme in New Zealand conservation management. However, the occurrence of unusually large-scale tree seeding events causing predator irruptions has posed exceptionally difficult challenges. Elliott and Kemp review the government's 2014 Battle for our Birds programme, which applied poison over 10% of New Zealand's native forests to reduce predators. Sullivan and Molles consider the role of community monitoring in restoration and emphasise that collaboration is essential to develop simple, accessible and informative monitoring systems that capitalise on modern technology. Riparian restoration is a critical issue because of the adverse effects of intensive farming on waterways. McKergow et al. assess the progress that has been made with riparian restoration and highlight some future challenges and solutions. One aspect of restoration that the articles presented here only cover in part is the rapid upsurge of restoration initiatives across private land, especially farmland. More than half of the New Zealand land area is used for primary production (meat, wool, milk, timber), which is vital to our economy. While farmers and foresters are primarily focused on running economically viable businesses, there has been a massive increase in the interest shown in restoration and biodiversity conservation more generally. There are now over 4000 legally binding conservation covenants with the Queen Elizabeth II National Trust covering nearly 200,000 ha of rural New Zealand whose primary purpose is to ensure that native remnants (forest, shrubland, wetland, grassland) are protected in perpetuity. Tens of thousands of kilometres of waterways and lake margins have been fenced, and many of them have been planted with native vegetation. The plantation forestry sector has signed an accord where NGOs recognise the importance of plantation forestry for the New Zealand economy while the forestry industry agrees not to clear native vegetation when establishing new plantations and protect existing native vegetation associated with plantations. Many farmers appreciate the value of native vegetation for their farming operations, not only aesthetic values but also the benefits it can provide for farming (shade, shelter, timber, pollinator habitat). The amount of native woody vegetation across rural New Zealand is higher today than it was half a century ago, helped in part by the 1980s removal of government subsidies for developing ‘rough country’. As a result, native woody vegetation is regenerating vigorously in many areas initiating a succession back to mature forest. Many ‘uneconomic’ farms are being bought by individuals and organisations whose primary goal is to restore natural values (Fig. 1). Several projects have recently been initiated that aim to integrate biodiversity conservation and farming across landscape scales, for example on Banks Peninsula (100,000 ha) and in Northland (1.4 million ha). An exciting new national initiative ‘Trees That Count’ has just been announced (July 2016) that aims to plant millions of native trees across rural New Zealand allowing for even greater reconnection and integration of native biodiversity. While New Zealand's native biodiversity has declined dramatically over the 800 years since the first Polynesian voyagers stepped ashore, the amount of restorative work that is now underway suggests that the outlook is not as bleak as it is often thought to be. Optimists focus on practical solutions, and the powerful nexus of restoration science and practice gives hope for the future; the examples discussed in this special section along with many others suggest that there are plenty of reasons to be optimistic for our biodiversity. At the time of writing this introduction (July 2016), the government has just announced a bold and aspirational vision for New Zealand to be completely predator free by 2050. If we are to be successful with this and other inspirational restoration initiatives, from local to national, then it is essential we ensure that restoration is about the inclusion and enthusiasm of people as much as it is about biodiversity, science and technology.

",,,,"Many aspects of the biotic or abiotic origin of iron-rich sedimentary rocks consisting mainly of hematite, an important indicator for exobiology, remain unresolved. Here, we use combined optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive X-ray spectrometry (SEM-EDS), Raman spectroscopy and time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (TOF-SIMS), to image the spatial distribution, and determine the composition, of potential biogenic markers (microbial microfossils, trace elements, organic ion species) in hematitemicrostromatolites and oncolite-like microstructures. These structures are identified in iron-rich material cementing a Quaternary fossil-beach conglomerate deposit in the Cape Vani area, NW Milos Island, Greece. The combined detection of morphological, chemical, and molecular organic-ion, biomarkers closely associated with possible hematite microfossils within microstromatolite laminae, strongly supports microbial mediation for their formation, and indicates that hematitic microlamination may be used as a biosignature for Fe-rich biomats on Earth and for their detection in extra-terrestrial materials. The Cape Vani hematitemicrostromatolites may contribute to growing our understanding of the function of microorganisms in the genesis of modern and ancient Fe deposits.

",,,,"Rhytidarex buddlei is a giant terrestrial landsnail endemic to South West Island in the Three Kings group. The distribution of old, empty shells indicates that this species was widespread over at least the northern half of the island in the 19th and possibly also early 20th centuries. However, at the end of the 20th century its geographic distribution was restricted to c. 0.03 ha on steep western slopes, and the estimated total population contained no more than 100 and probably fewer than 50 individuals. This decline correlated with, and probably resulted from, ecological changes associated with the widespread establishment of pukanui (Meryta sinclairii) forest on South West Island within the last 200 years. The modern snail population was confined to flax (Phormium aff. tenax) thickets and patches of mixed flax‐broadleaved shrubland within an overall mosaic of shrubland and low pukanui forest. The very small size and narrow geographic‐ecological distribution of the remaining population of R. buddlei place it at high risk of extinction from stochastic events, adverse ecological changes, and anthropic disturbances. Historical evidence of decline suggests that the species is unlikely to recover on its own without some form of external assistance. Potential conservation measures are discussed, and a preferred option is identified.","0303-6758

",,"Wiley
",,,,"Reptiles are a very diverse group with a long evolutionary history dating back 300 million years to the Pennsylvanian subsystem of the Carboniferous period (Hedges & Poling, 1999; Sahney et al., 2010). Reptiles have adapted to a variety of habitats in environments ranging from temperate to hot and moist to arid. Compared with birds and mammals, reptiles often have very restricted distributions with specific microhabitat requirements; making them particularly vulnerable to anthropogenic environmental changes (Anderson, 1984; Anderson & Marcus, 1992). As such, reptiles are a group of conservation concern. Of the 10 038 described species listed in The Reptile Database (Uetz & Hošek, 2014), 44% (c. 4416 species) have been evaluated for the International Union for Conservation of Nature's (IUCN) The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species (IUCN, 2014). Furthermore, there are 964 reptile species listed in the IUCN Red List Extinct, Extinct in the Wild, Critically Endangered (CR), Endangered and Vulnerable (VU) categories, which is 9·6% of the species listed in The Reptile Database. Nearly the same amount [8·7% (811 reptile species)] is listed as Data Deficient (IUCN, 2014), making it obvious that there are still many gaps in our knowledge. Reptiles constitute a small proportion [11% (c. 435 species)] of the 3955 (in 2011) non-domestic terrestrial vertebrate species maintained by zoological facilities reporting to International Species Information System (Conde et al., 2013). Of the 964 threatened reptiles listed in the IUCN Red List, 178 species (18·4%) are actually kept by zoos and aquariums but, considering that relatively small total number, c. 40% of all reptile species maintained by zoological facilities are threatened (Conde et al., 2013). While there are species-specific threats, there are several common factors that imperil all reptiles, including habitat alteration/destruction, pollution, over-collection and introduced species (Gibbons et al., 2000; Todd et al., 2010). Additionally, climate change is a recognized factor threatening reptile populations (Parmesan & Yohe, 2003; Stanton et al., 2015). For many taxa, temperature is important not only to the success of egg incubation but also for sex determination (Janzen, 1994); therefore, increasing global temperatures may have a detrimental impact on large numbers of reptile populations. Despite the threats reptiles are facing globally, the number of known species is still increasing. In 2014, The Reptile Database contained more than 10 000 species, including 139 species described that same year (see http://www.reptile-database.org/db-info/news.html; Uetz & Hošek, 2014). Many species are newly described in scientific articles. Zoological facilities make a valuable contribution to this science by participating in, supporting and/or conducting biodiversity research. In Phong Nha-Ke Bang National Park in central Vietnam, 13 new reptile taxa were described between 2002 and 2010 (Ziegler, 2010). Thorough investigation of these poorly accessible areas resulted in the discovery of species that are new to the scientific world. Often, these are cryptic species complexes that look alike and it is only by using new techniques, most often based on molecular investigations, that we are able to differentiate between the species (Hebert et al., 2003; Goldstein & DeSalle, 2010; Ziegler, 2015). Cryptic species complexes also occur in larger species, such as the VU African dwarf crocodile Osteolaemus tetraspis (IUCN, 2014; Schmidt et al., 2015). It is essential to carry out basic research in systematics and biodiversity, although the results may well have consequences for zoological facilities running conservation-breeding programmes, especially in relation to whether to manage such programmes by forming several taxonomically pure subpopulations or by continuing to include hybrids in the breeding programme. While new reptile species await discovery and description, many aspects of their biology and ecology remain the subject of future research. The success of conservation-breeding programmes for reptiles depends on the consideration of all aspects of their biology. For ex situ programmes, it is essential to consider the natural history of the species in order to optimize husbandry conditions and increase breeding results. The projects carried out by Cologne Zoo, Germany, in South East Asia are excellent examples of a holistic approach. They not only include basic research on biodiversity, with the description of newly discovered species, but also ecological studies of the animals in their natural habitat. Based on this knowledge, conclusions are drawn for the management of reptiles at Cologne Zoo and other zoological facilities, and the concurrent development of conservation projects in the range countries (Ziegler, 2015). Similarly, a decade has been dedicated to studying the spatial ecology, genetic diversity and natural history of rare vipers in Armenia: the Near Threatened Armenian viper Montivipera raddei, the CR Darevsky's viper Pelias darevskii and VU Armenian Steppe viper Pelias eriwanensis (IUCN, 2014; Ettling et al., 2015). Based on the results of this work, a conservation breeding centre for endemic reptiles and amphibians is being developed near Yerevan, Armenia, where these rare vipers can be bred and used to augment existing wild populations. The results of the field studies have also been used to expand and/or establish new protected areas for these snakes. The International Zoo Yearbook has dedicated three previous volumes to reptiles. The first was published in 1969 (Volume 9, also including amphibians) and the second in 1979 (Volume 19), and these focused mainly on breeding reports and husbandry for many reptile species that rarely reproduced in zoos and aquariums at that time. Today, some of these species breed regularly in zoological facilities while others still remain difficult to propagate under artificial conditions. In 1989, a third volume (Volume 28) was dedicated to reptiles (although it also included amphibians). Again, the focus was primarily on collection management in zoological facilities with a special emphasis on breeding success in selected species. However, in Volume 28, there was an article on Operation Curieuse, a conservation programme for the Aldabra giant tortoise Geochelone gigantea in the Republic of Seychelles (Spratt, 1989). This conservation project took place within the range country without a counterpart programme in a zoo. When comparing the articles that appeared in the previous three volumes with those that appear here in Volume 49, it becomes readily apparent that the herpetological specialism has developed a variety of methods to link work in zoos and aquariums with conservation programmes being carried out in the field. These two approaches, regarded as distinct in the past, will be blurred in the future (Pritchard et al., 2012). More recently, the IUCN Species Survival Commission Conservation Breeding Specialist Group adopted the One Plan Approach, which promotes cooperation between ex situ (zoological) institutions and in situ (range-country) stakeholders in order to manage all populations of species using unified, integrated plans (Byers et al., 2013). The maintenance and breeding of rare reptiles are no longer a primary goal for zoological facilities. The ultimate goal is to support the conservation of reptiles in their wild, natural habitats, and various means by which to achieve those goals are reported within Volume 49 of the International Zoo Yearbook. The successful breeding of the CR Northern river terrapin Batagur baska at Vienna Zoo, Austria, is described alongside details of the Zoo's involvement in Project Batagur and breeding the species successfully within Bangladesh (IUCN, 2014; Weissenbacher et al., 2015). The Northern river terrapin is a large, aquatic freshwater turtle, while the Egyptian tortoise Testudo kleinmanni is one of the world's smallest, terrestrial tortoises, which is classified as CR as a result of habitat destruction and collection for the pet trade (IUCN, 2014; Zwartepoorte, 2015). A successful breeding programme for the Egyptian tortoise in Europe, including the contribution of private hobbyists, who commit time, money and effort, and have a great deal of knowledge and personal commitment, as well as the conservation measures in place to protect the species in Egypt are described (Zwartepoorte, 2015). One of the greatest challenges for all conservation programmes is space. For reptiles, cooperation between zoological facilities and private hobbyists could alleviate some of this problem; either by providing facilities for breeding groups (Zwartepoorte, 2015) or by housing non-breeding individuals so space can be released in zoos and aquariums for breeding-programme animals. Another theme that runs through the Reptile Conservation section of Volume 49 is the fact that for field-conservation programmes to be successful, it is important to integrate local people who live within the range of the threatened species into the projects. For example, by delegating data-collection tasks to local Bedouins, and running training, education and awareness programmes for the Sweiriki people, the Egyptian tortoise recovery programme fully integrates the local community in its work (Zwartepoorte, 2015). However, involving the local community in conservation programmes can be challenging, especially when dealing with potentially dangerous and often misjudged species, such as crocodilians, which are hunted in many regions of the world. This can make it difficult to establish a conservation project in the range countries. The CR Philippine crocodile Crocodylus mindorensis is bred for release purposes in several locations in its natural range (IUCN, 2014; Manalo & Alcala, 2015), and successful breeding programmes exist both in North America and Europe. However, an intensive programme of public awareness, information campaigns, community empowerment and capacity building has been necessary to protect the Philippine crocodile from poaching or killing after human–wildlife conflicts in its natural range. Similar public-awareness campaigns and capacity-building measures have been used to involve local communities in the conservation of the VU Komodo dragon Varanus komodoensis in Flores (IUCN, 2014; Ariefiandy et al., 2015), the Aruba Island rattlesnake Crotalus unicolor [IUCN, 2014: Least Concern (LC)] (Odum & Reinert, 2015) and the VU Hungarian meadow viper Vipera ursinii rakosiensis (IUCN, 2014; Péchy et al., 2015). The Aruba Island rattlesnake Species Survival Plan (Odum & Reinert, 2015) and West Indian iguana Cyclura spp reintroduction and recovery programmes (Grant & Hudson, 2015) are two examples of long-term (30+ years) reptile conservation commitments by zoos. Both programmes have benefited these threatened insular reptiles by using a combination of ex situ and in situ components. In addition to maintaining populations in zoos and aquariums, zoological facilities have also provided valuable contributions to the field-research effort in terms of funding and expertise that have ultimately made significant differences for the conservation of these species. Over many decades, the CR Indian Gharial Gavialis gangeticus has been one of the most recognizable examples of a successful release project for reptiles (IUCN, 2014). In the mid-1970s, populations of the Gharial dropped dramatically to a few hundred animals. The Indian government established Project Crocodile primarily for head-starting thousands of animals for augmentation of remaining wild populations (Stevenson, 2015). In the late 1970s, one of the last Gharials at a European zoo was sent from Frankfurt Zoo, Germany, back to India to support this conservation project. Another population crash occurred in the late 1990s, indicating that the effectiveness of this release programme needed to be improved dramatically in order to persist. An overview of the decades of conservation efforts for the Indian Gharial is provided and concludes with perspectives for the future (Stevenson, 2015). The VU Sunda gharial Tomistoma schlegelii also poses complex challenges for breeding in zoological facilities, while studying their ecology in the wild is difficult owing to their shy and secretive nature, and the inaccessibility of their natural habitat (IUCN, 2014). A healthy population of Sunda gharial was discovered a few years ago in Lake Mesangat in Kalimantan, Borneo. Field studies at this location were supported by the Tomistoma Task Force of the IUCN Crocodile Specialist Group, branded as a World Association of Zoos and Aquariums conservation project and financially supported by many zoos (Stuebing et al., 2015). The same site also served as the location for a study on the autecology of the CR Siamese crocodile Crocodylus siamensis carried out by Cologne Zoo (IUCN, 2014; Stuebing et al., 2015; Ziegler, 2015). This is only one of several crocodilian conservation projects supported by the work of zoos and aquariums, and between 2009 and 2014, US$1 183 370 was contributed by zoological facilities solely to crocodilian projects (Adams et al., in press). Financial support for the Komodo Survival Program has been provided by the European Association of Zoos and Aquaria, and participants of the European Endangered Species Programme for the VU Komodo dragon contribute towards the Wae Wuul protection programme on the Indonesian Island of Flores (Ariefiandy & Purwandana, 2013; G. Garcia, pers. comm.). External funding, channelled through the Balai Besar Konservasi Sumber Daya Alam, has been used to rebuild a ranger post, train local rangers on how to monitor animals and conduct an awareness campaign for local people (Ariefiandy et al., 2015). Zoological facilities not only focus their attention on exotic reptile species but also, in some instances, to threatened species living in their own region. Research projects and conservation-management measures can be carried out within the grounds of a zoo. An example can be found at Prague Zoo in the Czech Republic, where a colony of the LC European Green lizard Lacerta viridis is regularly monitored (IUCN, 2014; Rehák, 2015). Habitat-modification and preservation measures have been used to ensure the species persists in this region. Similarly, a conservation programme for the Hungarian meadow viper is an example of a local project involving several collaborating entities (Péchy et al., 2015). The ex situ programme was initiated in 2004 with 16 adult vipers (collected between 2004 and 2008). By 2013, the number of vipers bred had reached c. 1700 individuals. The first release of 30 adult vipers occurred in 2010 and by 2013, 240 vipers had been released at three different sites (Péchy et al., 2015). Post-release monitoring indicated that breeding was taking place and 18 of the released females observed were gravid. Public education was a strong component of these successful conservation programmes (Péchy et al., 2015; Rehák, 2015). In Volumes 19 and 28 of the International Zoo Yearbook, there were articles on the status of the CR Western Australian swamp tortoise Pseudemydura umbrina in captivity (IUCN, 2014). In the late 1970s, the situation was already serious with numbers of individuals in the wild ranging between 30 and 90 specimens. Perth Zoo, Australia, had 21 animals that bred and produced very low numbers of offspring (Spence et al., 1979). The situation became increasingly severe in the early 1980s with only 15–25 animals remaining in the wild and 17 animals at Perth Zoo, none of which had bred since 1980 (Kuchling & DeJose, 1989). Immediate action was required, including propagation and release programmes. Although still classified as CR, the conservation measures taken during the late 1980s proved to be successful and the population recovered. One of the key elements to this success was the use of ultrasound scanning of adult females, which marked the first time that this technique had been used as a management tool to assess the reproductive status of a turtle (Kuchling, 1989). Since then, ultrasound has been used in various other chelonian species. This technique has not only enhanced our knowledge about the natural history of the Western swamp tortoise by revealing some little-studied or unknown traits but also contributed actively to the conservation of highly threatened species (Kuchling, 2015). One of the most famous articles in the long history of the International Zoo Yearbook is certainly ‘How to exhibit a bullfrog: a bed-time story for zoo men’, written by William G. Conway (Conway, 1973) and well known to every zoo biologist. A crocodile museum that meets many of the criteria described in Conway's (1973) article was constructed in the 1990s at Zoológico Regional Miguel Álvarez del Toro in Tuxtla Gutierrez, Mexico. Luis Sigler, who was the responsible curator at that time, describes the development of the exhibit in detail (Sigler, 2015). This sort of paper follows a long tradition of the International Zoo Yearbook to publish articles describing developments in the education of visitors, including an article on exhibiting reptiles by Gans (1979) in Volume 19 and an investigation into improving visitor appreciation of reptiles using an innovative new ‘behind-the-scenes’ exhibit design at Dallas Zoo, TX, USA, in Volume 28 (Murphy & Mitchell, 1989). Zoological facilities can make valuable contributions to the scientific understanding and conservation of reptiles. As many species have cryptic behaviour, zoos and aquariums have the unique opportunity to observe, record and publish information about the natural history and biology of reptiles. For example, zoos maintaining Komodo dragons have recently documented that the species can reproduce parthenogenetically (Watts et al., 2006). Many zoos and aquariums have solid reptile husbandry experience and associated breeding programmes, which are essential to maintaining assurance colonies that can be used for augmentation and reintroduction programmes in due course. This volume of the International Zoo Yearbook demonstrates with a few examples, albeit representing many others, that a number of conservation programmes have benefited not only from reptiles bred in zoological institutions but also from collective zoo knowledge, financial contributions, expertise, efforts and the commitment of staff. We are confident that the contents of this volume clearly demonstrate the evolution of herpetology programmes in zoological institutions, with the movement away from large collections of occasionally breeding reptiles towards linked partnerships for the conservation of species in their natural habitats worldwide. Volume 49 of the International Zoo Yearbook provides examples of the links between zoological facilities and field-conservation programmes, lending support to the One Plan Approach (Byers et al., 2013). The world's zoos and aquariums are visited by more than 700 million people each year (http://www.waza.org), providing the perfect platform to educate visitors not only about the problems reptiles are facing in a rapidly changing world but also about the projects and programmes that have been developed to counter these threats.

",,,,"Tropical urban coastal wetland regeneration is complex. Wetland plant biodiversity varies due to past and present land use, nutrient inputs, hydrological conditions, and terrestrial/marine connectivity. The intensity of atmospheric disturbances, such as hurricanes, will determine these systems’ level of disturbance and regeneration capacity. On September 20, 2017, category 4 hurricane María passed over Puerto Rico, leaving behind a path of destruction across the entire island, especially in coastal ecosystems, from the combined effects of winds, severe storm surges, and urban runoff. Our question was: to what extent do human-influenced coastal urban wetlands regenerate after such a massive event. This study determines the spatio-temporal regeneration dynamics of plant cover and composition during the first 2 years after hurricane María in a coastal urban wetland, ciénaga Las Cucharillas, located in San Juan Bay. We assessed the distribution of plant functional types using small unmanned aerial vehicles (s-UAV) and monitored climate and environmental data (salinity, phreatic water levels, and precipitation). Wetland vegetation cover had a high recovery rate – 16 months after the hurricane, vegetation cover occupied 87% of the study area. We found a successional pattern of plant regeneration that seemed to be partly explained by the fast-slow continuum. Plants with high specific leaf area (SLA) colonized bare soil spaces first. Plant regeneration also varied according to changes in phreatic water conductivity and waterlogging. Isotopic analyses of plant species signaled high nutrient availability, increasing the system’s regeneration speed. After 2 years, the wetland’s plant cover and composition of functional plant types proved resilient to the initial hurricane effect and subsequent changes in conductivity and freshwater conditions. Further studies will expand how spatio-temporal conditions will affect long-term plant community dynamics.

",,,,,,"&#x0D; Abstract &#x0D; &#x0D; &#x0D; Avian species on Small Island Developing States (SIDS) are at particular risk from agricultural and urban expansion and climate change. However, creating appropriate management and mitigation actions for SIDS is challenging because ecological and conservation data are often unavailable. To better understand natural and anthropogenic habitat use by resident bird species in a small Neotropical SIDS, we conducted a systematic, community-wide survey of the distribution, diversity, and abundance of Grenada's land birds. Higher densities of most species were found in anthropogenic cultivated and secondary grasslands, while cloud and secondary forests had lower densities of most species. Nonetheless, cloud and secondary forests were selected by some species of conservation concern, such as the regionally endemic Lesser Antillean Tanager (Tangara cucullata), Grenada Flycatcher (Myiarchus nugator), and all nectarivores. Nectarivores tended to avoid urban habitats. Our results suggest that many avian species in Grenada make significant use of low-intensity agricultural and rural landscapes, and such habitats should be considered in the conservation of avian communities. Conservation of resident land- bird communities across this region will require maintaining a habitat mosaic of natural and anthropogenic habitat types, and collaboration among a wide range of government and non-governmental stakeholders.&#x0D; &#x0D; &#x0D; Keywords &#x0D; &#x0D; &#x0D; agriculture, conservation, Grenada, habitat selection, island, terrestrial&#x0D; &#x0D; &#x0D; Resumen &#x0D; &#x0D; &#x0D; Uso por parte de las aves de hábitats antropogénicos y naturales en un pequeño estado insular en desarrollo • Las especies de aves en los Pequeños Estados Insulares en Desarrollo (SIDS) corren un riesgo particular debido a la expansión agrícola y urbana y al cambio climático.

","Carvalho, Rafael; Hamylton, Sarah; Woodroffe, Colin",,,,,2017.0,,,1,5,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"This study applies different techniques, such as single and multibeam bathymetry, sidescan sonar, terrestrial LiDAR, RTK-GPS, underwater drop camera and bathymetry derived from WorldView-2 optical imagery, to map the `white ribbon', a term first coined by the British Geological Survey which refers to the terrestrial-marine interface known for the lack of data and hydrographic challenges associated with it. The `white ribbon' area is of extreme importance for coastal managers, scientists and engineers interested in sediment dynamics, volume estimates and coastal connectivity. The `white ribbon', or the interface area formed by the intertidal and nearshore zones, is generally too shallow and dangerous for most traditional bathymetric survey vessels, due to rocks, reefs and waves, and too deep for land-based survey methods. Herein, we present the integration of data collected by multiple Australian organisations (University of Wollongong, Geoscience Australia, NSW Office of Environment and Heritage, and NSW Land and Property Information) into seamless digital elevation models for three sites (Beecroft Peninsula, Gerroa and Five Islands) on the South Coast of NSW. Two major challenges were associated with this study: the use of a small aluminium vessel to collect singlebeam bathymetry in shallow water, and the integration of the Australian Height Datum (AHD) and the Chart Datum. Research findings were particularly relevant for understanding of sediment mobility between different coastal compartments, mapping of geomorphic features, underwater extension of headlands, unconsolidated and consolidated substrates, and different rock reef habitats.",,,,,,"https://doi.org/10.1109/rioacoustics.2017.8349743

Nusantara Bioscience 13: 245-259. Orchid is well known as a plant group widely used as ornamental plants because of their uniqueness. But, high exploitation, deforestation, and land-use changes have threatened orchid species and triggered extinction. It also happened in Mount Ungaran, Central Java, Indonesia, despite designation as an essential ecosystem area. This research was conducted to add an updated list of wild orchid species that can serve as biodiversity baseline data for conservation management in Mount Ungaran. The study was carried out through exploration activities from 2010 to 2021. The study area covered eleven sites namely Gentong Hills, Kalisidi, Pasigitan, Banyuwindu, Gajahmungkur, Watuondo, Mawar Camp, Indrakila, Gondang and Puncak which were all included in the buffer zone of Mount Ungaran. A total of 115 species from 54 genera of orchids were successfully identified, including 78 species of epiphyte and 37 species of terrestrial orchids. Among the species recorded, at least 27 species were known to be endemic to Indonesia, and 8 species were endemic to the island of Java, which four species were listed in the IUCN Red List. In addition, all the species found were listed in Appendix II of the CITES, except one species, Paphiopedilum javanicum which was listed in Appendix I. This study recorded the new distribution records of several species of orchids that were previously only found in West Java or East Java, i.e., Ania penangiana, Pholidota convallariae, and Crepidium junghuhnii. This study has also documented a species from genus Crepidium, which morphological characters have not been described in any identification guides. The Gentong area has potential as a priority for in-situ orchid protection area by the highest number of species were reached 54% of all orchids found on Mount Ungaran.

It distances approximately 5.7 miles from mainland. Berlengas was firstly classified as Natural Reserve in 1981. In 1998 this area was reclassified as Marine Reserve Area, increasing its territory to its present size (104 ha) ((Amado et al., 2007). In 2011, the International Coordinating Council of UNESCO’s Man and the Biosphere Programme (MAB) included the Berlengas archipelago in the World Network of Biosphere Reserves (WNBR), demonstrating the importance of this natural reserve worldwide. Berlengas archipelago hosts important features, due to its insular nature, geological characteristics, geographical location and climate, the presence of the Nazaré Canyon, a submarine canyon, along with a low human interference motivated by the small size of the islands and land scarcity. Altogether, these characteristics contributed to promote local high biodiversity, either endemic terrestrial plant species, marine bird species, marine invertebrates, fish or marine mammals (Amado et al., 2007; Queiroga, et al. 2008). Due to insular isolation, as well as to severe climatic and edaphic conditions, Berlengas terrestrial flora evolved rapidly and quite differently from the species of mainland. The harsh island conditions lead to speciation process that differentiated three endemic species, of great conservation value: Armeria berlengensis, Herniaria lusitanica subsp. berlengiana and Pulicaria microcephala. Two of these species – A. berlengensis and H. lusitanica subsp. berlengiana – are registered in Annex II of the Habitats Directive, due to their conservation relevance, and are considered critically endangered and endangered, respectively, according to IUCN (Caldas, 2011a, 2011b). Other species of the shore can be found here, some of them having a restricted geographical distribution, either Iberian or Iberian and north Africa: Angelica pachycharpa, Calendula suffruticosa subsp. algarbiensis, Echium rosulatum, Linaria amethystea subsp. multipunctata, Narcissus bulbocodium subsp. obesus, Silene latifolia subsp. mariziana, Silene scabriflora and Scrophularia sublyrata (Queiroga, et al., 2008). Although, the endemic and halophyte flora of Berlenga is still flourishing, it is being threatened by several factors. To begin with, the introduction, in the late 1950s, of the species Carpobrotus edulis, an invasive species. Another threat is the oversized population of seagulls that nest on the larger specimens of A. berlenguensis, destroying them. Finally, the increasing number of ruderal plant species that live on the litter produced by the seabirds, and tend to modify natural floristic composition (Tauleigne Gomes, Draper, & Rosselló-Graell, 2001). Therefore, the control of seagulls has been undertaken for more than ten years and in 2014 a project for the recovery of the Berlengas ecosystems has begun – LIFE BERLENGAS, including the removal of Carpobrotus edulis. Since may 2015, we installed several areas with metal structures and fishing line, preventing the access of seagulls and other birds. The vegetation of these “exclusion areas” and other equivalent free areas have been monitored seasonally to access the evolution of the vegetation in the past three years. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS A principal component analysis (PCA) for the percentage of occurrence of the observed species was performed to emphasize the correlations and possible patterns between the areas (with A. berlengensis with and without structure, without A. berlengensis with and without structure) and sampling periods (May and August 2015, January, May, August, November 2016, February and May 2017). The principal components (PC1 and PC2) provide information on the most meaningful parameters, which describe a whole data set affording data reduction with minimum loss of original information. Although the results concerning the first two components were presented, the others were also analysed. Percentage data were arcsine transformed to normalize variance (Legendre & Legendre, 1979). All calculations were performed with CANOCO version 4.5 package (Ter Braak & Smilauer, 2002). In addition, to evaluate the strength of the correlations between total percentage of vegetal cover and total density of A. berlengensis, Pearson’s correlation coefficient (r) were used (Zar, 2010). All calculations were made with IBMM SPSS Statistics version 24 software. All results were considered significant at p-value ≤ 0.05 level. RESULTS The PCA showed that 47.3% of total variance was explained by the two principal components. PC1 expressed 32.9% of total variance, which is the most significant response regarding the separation between structure treatments. This demonstrates that the percentage of A. berlengensis (especially), Anchusa undulata, and Plantago coronopus increases with structure treatments, for all years, mainly in May (followed by August). These results reinforce, thus, that the absence of disturbance seems to favour the growth of the rupicola A. berlenguensis but also of some ruderal species. Moreover, Echium rosulatum and Calendula suffruticosa subsp. algarbiensis presented higher cover percentages without A. berlengensis (with and without structures), as they are ruderal species tending to rapidly occupy available nitrophilous soil. On the other hand, Lobularia maritima, Mercurialis ambigua, Scrophularia sublyrata, Urtica membranacea and Erodium cicutarium increased in A. berlengensis areas without structure, for all analysed years, mostly in autumn and winter samples. In general, those species presented a null correlation with A. berlengensis, Anchusa undulata, Plantago coronopus, Echium rosulatum and Calendula suffruticosa subsp. algarbiensis. Overall, there seems to be a recovery of the vegetation of the island, either rupicola or ruderal species. Besides PCA, data indicate a slight correlation between the presence of the protection structure and the number of A. berlengensis specimens. Still, these results need to be extended in time, so that this trend can be confirmed.

Since the waters surrounding Salas y Gómez were established as Motu Motiro Hiva Marine Park in 2010, marine investigations have been the primary research focus. Secondarily, nesting seabird communities have been censused since 2011. Methods and findings In 2016, terrestrial arthropods were sampled on the island. Two observers sampled two locations for 30 min per site. Fifteen morphospecies were identified including at least one likely undescribed species. Conclusions Our work represents the most comprehensive terrestrial arthropod inventory of Salas y Gómez island to date. We are hopeful the recommendations provided will spur additional research to both characterize the island’s arthropod community, as well as identify species of management concern.

","Quesada-Ruiz, Lorenzo; Caparros-Santiago, Jose; Garcia-Perez, Miguel; Rodríguez‐Galiano, Víctor",,Seasonality; Growing season,,,2021.0,,,7,7,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Land surface phenology (LSP), the study of seasonal dynamics of vegetation analysing phenological metrics -phenometrics- derived from vegetation indices time series (VI), has emerged as an important research focus in recent decades as LSP patterns have been considered as an important ecological indicator for understanding the functioning of terrestrial ecosystems. LSP from high-spatial-resolution satellite imagery in ecosystems with significant heterogeneity of plant species, such as Macaronesian ecosystems, are needed for a better understanding on how these ecosystems function. The objective of this study was to monitor LSP dynamics of representative species of the Canary Islands: Olea Cerasiformis, Pistacia atlantica, Juniperus turbinata, Pinus canariensis, Myrica Faya and Erica arborea. NDVI (Normalised Difference Vegetation Index) Sentinel-2 time series at a spatial and temporal resolution of 10 meters and 5 days were generated for the 2018-2020 period. Atmospheric disturbances and noise were reduced using a double-logistic function. SOS (start of the growing season), EOS (end of the growing season) and LOS (length of the growing season) were extracted using a threshold-based method. Thermophilus species, such as Olea Cerasiformis and Pistacia atlantica had the SOS in October-November and the EOS between June and July. Juniperus turbinata showed double seasonality in La Palma, being the first growing season between November-December and April-May and the second growing season between May-June and September-October. Growing season of Pinus canariensis started in September-October and ended in April-June, nevertheless a double seasonality was observed in some locations of Pinus canariensis, probably associated to the understory. Subtropical laurel forest composed by different plant species, such as Myrica Faya and Erica arborea, did not show a clear seasonality. The species-specific LSP patterns for the Canary Islands can contribute to stablishing a baseline to monitor future impacts of climate change in Macaronesian biogeographical region.",,,,,,"https://doi.org/10.1117/12.2600125

The species can only be found on the north-west slopes of the highest volcano on Isabela Island and was first described to science in 2009. As part of a population telemetry study, a health assessment was authorized by the Galápagos National Park. Wild adult iguanas were captured on Wolf Volcano in September 2019 and April 2021 to record morphological and physiological parameters including body temperature, heart rate, intraocular pressures, tear formation, and infrared iris images. Blood samples were also collected and analyzed. An i-STAT portable blood analyzer was used to obtain values for base excess in the extracellular fluid compartment (BEecf), glucose (Glu), hematocrit (HctPCV), hemoglobin (Hb), ionized calcium (iCa), partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO2), partial pressure of oxygen (pO2), percent oxygen saturation (sO2%), pH, potassium (K), and sodium (Na). When possible, data were compared to previously published and available data for the other Galápagos iguanas. The results reported here provide baseline values that will be useful in detecting changes in health status among pink land iguanas affected by climate change, invasive species, anthropogenic threats, or natural disturbances. The collected data also provide an invaluable resource for conservation scientists planning to implement conservation strategies, like translocations, that may temporarily alter these baseline values.

The section, named Ekelöf Coast, includes the lowest levels of the Upper Cretaceous Hamilton Point Member of the Snow Hill Island Formation. Among the foraminifera, 18 benthic taxa including 10 agglutinated and eight calcareous are recognized. Palynomorphs include continental and marine species. The continental assemblage contains 44 spore and pollen species. The marine assemblage consists of 10 peridinioid dinoflagellate cysts species, dominating in number of specimens, and 10 gonyaulacoids. Although the palynomorph assemblage supports a late Campanian age for the section, an earliest Maastrichtian age is not excluded. The paleoenvironmental interpretation based on the distribution of foraminiferal morphogroups indicates an outer shelf-upper bathyal environment in agreement with sedimentological data. The paleoenvironmental inference based on the S/D ratio (sporomorph versus dinoflagellate cysts) and the P/G ratio (peridinioid versus gonyaulacoid cysts) suggest a coastal to inner neritic setting with a continuous continental supply from the continent to the marine environment, evidenced by the slight dominance of the peridionoids over gonyaulacoids cysts. The discrepancy observed between palynological and micropaleontological-sedimentological data may be linked to the development of a narrow continental shelf during the Late Cretaceous. In such continental shelf, terrestrial palynomorphs and peridinoid cysts would quickly run down the slope and would be deposited in the deep marine environment together with gonyaulacoid cysts.

",,,,,,"Surtsey and the older islands in the Vestmannaeyjar archepelago offer a unique possibility to study how subArctic ecosystems develop from unvegetated mineral volcanic substrate to grasslands with thick Brown Andosol soils. The present study was carried out on 24 study plots distributed across six different ecoystems on Surtsey, Heimaey and Elliðaey islands and involved field measurements of soil volumetric water content (VWC), vascular plant cover (VPC) and instantanious rate of gross primary production (GPP). Remote sensing was also used to determine the vegetation indices of normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), photochemical reflectance index (PRI) and chlorophyll/carotenoid index (CCI) of each plot and find their relationships to the measured VPC and GPP. Nýjahraun on Heimaey and the area not affected by seabirds on Surtsey were not significantly different in any measured variable. During their initial 48-58 years of primary succession, they had reached ca. 3% (VPC) to 12-13% (GPP, VWC) of the measured variables in the 5900-year-old Lyngfellisdalur on Heimaey, which has negligible seabird nutrient inputs. However, the measured VPC and GPP had reached similar levels in only 58 years in the seabird-affected parts of Surtsey as measured on the 5900-year-old seabird-affected Elliðaey. This shows how seabirds can greatly speed up ecosystem development by oceanic nutrient inputs into terrestrial ecosystems. Significant relationships were found between NDVI and VPC and between CCI and GPP, which may become important tools to track ecosystem development in space and time on the islands.

The importance of Earth's forests cannot be overemphasized because they are the world's largest repositories of terrestrial biodiversity. They also play a vital role in people's lives by providing many different goods and services. The socioeconomic benefits of forests are mostly derived from consumption. Forest products make a significant contribution to the shelter of at least 1.3 billion people (18% of the world's population), about 2.4 billion people cook with wood fuel, and edible nonwood products collected in forests contribute to the food security of millions of people (FAO 2014). In addition to their direct contributions, forests also provide soil and water conservation, protection against landslides and avalanches, and play an important role in global climate-change mitigation. The use of forests and forest products has as long a history as human societies. However, the magnitude of direct and indirect human impacts on forests has increased to a frightening level, causing unprecedented rates of forest change. Destruction and fragmentation, environmental pollution, and alteration of composition and structure of forests have all led to a dramatic decrease in forest biodiversity, and many services provided by forests have been compromised. The spread of nonnative species and pathogens has caused large changes in forest composition and dynamics. The Global Forest Resource Assessment (Keenan et al. 2015) shows that total forest area has declined by 3% (from 4128 million ha in 1990 to 3999 million ha in 2015); annual rate of net forest loss has decreased by half (from 7.3 million ha/year in the 1990s to 3.3 million ha/year from 2010 to 2015); natural forest area declined (from 3961 million ha to 3721 million ha); and planted forest (including rubber plantations) increased (from 168 million ha to 278 million ha). We live in an era when forests are the focus of interest for many reasons. Despite the great number of recent books on the relationship between forests and climate change (e.g., Peterson et al. 2014), there is increasing demand for integrating knowledge across disciplines and geographical regions to provide sound bases for forest conservation, for better prediction of future changes, and for planning necessary restoration. It is equally important to spread this knowledge to a wider audience so that public awareness can be raised. All 3 books I reviewed fulfill parts of the above goals because they are written for different audiences and cover diverse facets of the multitude of possible topics concerning forests. Joe Landsberg and Richard Waring's Forests in Our Changing World gives an excellent overview of the world's forests that is based on a sound knowledge of their physiology and ecology. The book is written in a clear style and thus is suitable for nonprofessionals. The introduction demonstrates the importance of forests for humans and outlines the long history of human impacts on forests. Subsequent chapters give short accounts of major forest formations and the major ecological factors (temperature, solar radiation, air humidity, and soil water) that determine forest growth and type. At the end of the chapters “Plantations and Managed Forests” (chapter 2) and “Implications of Forest Clearance for Hydrology and Climate” (chapter 3), the human dimensions of these topics are covered. Chapter 4 is devoted to the causes and results of rapid climate change and describes, again in a very clear style, what is known, what is uncertain, and the role of extreme events. The chapter ends with examples of the effects of climate change on forests. The second half of the book first describes the value and use of forests. Chapter 5 ends with a discussion on important ways forests are abused, including through urban development that took place, for example, in forests of California and Australia that led to devastating fires. Several drivers of tropical rainforest destruction are also described, including illegal logging in Papua New Guinea and an increase in palm-oil plantations in Indonesia and Malaysia. The chapter “The Economics and Practices of Forest Management” outlines the economic principles and ideas that need to be considered when forest management is planned and implemented. This chapter is especially useful for those devoted conservationists and ecologists who admire and fear for forest biodiversity but have limited understanding of the driving forces that determine their use. The last chapter is “The Future for Forests.” Here, the authors take into account the crucial role and impacts of changing climate and discuss how forest managers and conservationists can help slow these processes and minimize harmful consequences by conserving forests. This introductory textbook is an excellent resource for a broad range of secondary and undergraduate students. It also provides a quick overview and a wider understanding for specialists who may be experts in one aspect of the topics covered but need a broader overview. Forests and Global Change was written with different aims for a different audience. As for many of the other volumes in the Ecological Reviews series, this book has its roots in the plenary talks given at the British Ecological Society Symposium with the same title. David Coomes, David Burslem, and William Simonson did a great job as editors to bring together leading scientists engaged in research on how forests respond to global change with the special aim of synthesizing knowledge from temperate and tropical ecosystems. After an introductory chapter by Simonson et al., 14 chapters are arranged under 3 main topics. The first section “Forest Dynamics and Global Change” starts with an essay by John Grace (chapter 2), who examines interactions between forest and climate systems based on global circulation model simulations and recent developments in factors often missing from general circulation models such as gases other than CO2, volatile organic compounds, and aerosols. This chapter is followed by 3 chapters on the effects of climate change on forests in 3 different biomes. Vallardes et al. (chapter 3) show for Mediterranean forests that in addition to ecophysiological understanding of individual species responses, biotic interactions and the interplay of multiple drivers need to be considered to better predict future responses. In their review of recent changes in tropical forests, Phillips and Lewis (chapter 4) reveal possible changes in biomass due to shifts in precipitation. They also discuss the effects of rising temperature on respiratory processes and photosynthetic efficiency. Using eastern North America as an example, Charles Canham (chapter 5) shows that in temperate forests, it is even harder to predict effects of climate change because anthropogenic disturbance, pollution, and historical management also have large effects on forest composition. The 6 chapters in the second section “Species Traits and Responses to Changing Resource Availability” apply a functional approach to understanding the underlying mechanisms that drive change in species composition as a result of climate change. Chave (chapter 6) reviews knowledge on past environmental shifts in Amazonia and describes the method currently being used to delineate functional types for tropical forest trees. He emphasizes the importance of neglected plant physiological aspects in current definitions and calls for a whole-plant perspective that incorporates a greater range of traits into dynamic global vegetation models. In chapter 7, Purves and Vanderwel present a modeling approach to improve the understanding of species coexistence. Their theoretical framework links traits, states of the community, and rates of vegetation change. They argue that their traits–states–rates framework could help ecologists understand the coexistence of multiple species in forest communities. Scherer-Lorenzen (chapter 8) reviews how complementarity of tree species has been applied in silviculture since the 19th century. He also reviews recent (published after 2005) literature on biodiversity and ecosystem functioning, with an emphasis on how relatively higher species richness of trees has a predominately positive effect on tree growth, wood production, and forest ecosystem processes. Oliveira-Filho et al. (chapter 9) deal with tropical dry woodlands, an important but often undervalued vegetation type, and show that the floras of seasonally dry woodlands (caatinga) and savanna woodlands (cerrado) are phylogenetically distinct because they have different evolutionary histories driven by differences in the leaf trait of deciduousness. The following 2 papers analyze the impact of water and nutrient availability on forest change. Comita and Engelbrecht (chapter 10) focus on how different plant traits are useful in determining seedling response to drought and the effects of drought on tropical tree regeneration, dynamics, and distribution. Considering existing evidence, the predicted increase in drought frequency will result in shifts in tree species composition and ecosystem processes. Kobe et al. (chapter 11) explore how changes in nutrient availability can modulate the effects of climate change. This is especially important in our era when human-induced changes in soil nutrients are occurring as a result of atmospheric nitrogen deposition, which causes acidification that leads to increased nutrient loss by leaching. The authors provide evidence that limits to tree species distributions are determined not only by climate but also by soil nutrient and water availability. In the final section, readers can get a closer look at current methods to detect and model change in forest ecosystems. Asner (chapter 12) gives new insights into how hyperspectral images can be used to map species diversity patterns in tropical rainforests by sensing chemical traits of canopy trees. Harald Bugman (chapter 13) gives a good synopsis of the challenges of forecasting the effects of climate change in very large and old forests. By studying the potential and limitations of forest-succession models, he concludes that although one needs to remember that “[a]ll models are wrong, but some models are useful” (Box & Draper 1987), modern models of forest dynamics could be used in the assessment of global-change impacts. Based on data from permanent plots, Muller-Landau et al. (chapter 14) deal with the practical difficulties of detecting and projecting biomass change in old-growth forests. They explain how to minimize errors in predicting changes in ground-based biomass estimates by presenting relatively easy-to-understand statistical approaches. In the final chapter, Newton and Echeverria (chapter 15) focus on human influence on forest diversity by using a cross-continental comparison of drivers, patterns, and effects of habitat loss and fragmentation. They emphasize that despite the importance of local context, multiple case studies can help formulate some tentative generalizations to be tested in the future. Overall, Forests and Global Change provides a deep overview of the research needs and state-of-the-art in a variety of forest ecosystems. Of particular value–compared with others on similar themes–is the wide range of topics and geographical regions covered. In Large Scale Forest Restoration, David Lamb aims to explore how to achieve effective, large-scale reforestation or restoration to increase landscape heterogeneity, improve ecological functioning, and restore ecosystem services in tropical and extratropical regions. The book starts with an assessment of contemporary land degradation (i.e., places in need of restoration) and then covers the history of reforestation. The potential for natural regrowth is also analyzed, and then other forms of reforestation (planting seedlings or sowing seeds) are discussed. Existing silvicultural systems for the production or restoration of ecosystem services are reviewed. The importance of spatial aspects (location and extent) of the various forms of reforestation and their effects on ecological functioning are treated in detail. The discussion on policy and institutional settings needed to encourage large-scale reforestation shows that to improve resilience during reforestation necessitates not only ecological but also social, economic, and institutional support. This book is a valuable resource to support efforts to restore vast deforested and degraded land. Each book I reviewed contributes knowledge that is indispensable to understanding how to conserve, manage, or restore forests in our fast-changing world so that they can continue to provide services for people without a loss of forest biodiversity.

Introduction .—Before proceeding to describe the plants from the localities in question, and their geological horizon, we append a brief historical outline of the vegetable remains of the Scotch Old Red Sandstone. The gradually accumulating evidence of a terrestrial flora in the Old Red Sandstone of Scotland since the first discovery of plants in that formation by the Rev. Dr. Fleming and Hugh Miller, and the reference of many of them to land rather than aquatic forms, by Charles William Peach, leads all observers interested in the subject to hope that ere long botanists may be in possession of sufficient material to enable them to illustrate the flora of that remote period in a more satisfactory manner than can be done at present, and to restore, in some degree at least, the bygone vegetable organisms which then existed. As a slight contribution to this end, we have now the pleasure of announcing the discovery by one of us (R. L.

Ecosistemas 29(2):1971. https://doi.org/10.7818/ECOS.1971 Over the last two decades, Macaronesia has proved to be an ideal system for biologists who seek to unravel patterns and processes of colonisation, diversification, and extinction of different taxa. Much of this research has been performed with plants and animals but few studies have analysed this topic using parasite assemblages. Here we review the influence of Macaronesian vertebrate parasites on our understanding of host-parasite relationships. Studies focused on native terrestrial birds and reptiles have provided information on presence, prevalence and genetic characterization of haematozoan and gastrointestinal parasites. In general, results support recognised concepts within the theory of island biogeography where parasite diversity (and prevalence) is positively associated with island area, but negatively associated with island isolation, at least in parasites with two-host life cycle. In addition, anthropogenic factors emerge as important factors governing the distribution and prevalence of avian parasites, while for reptiles such information is absent. We show that parasites are not uniformly distributed in reptiles, but lizards host the majority number of species and the highest prevalence levels. Such a result could be explained due to their earlier age of colonisation and specific life history traits. Despite these promising advances, we are at a very early stage in our understanding of the role of intermediate hosts in different aspects: incompatibility or specificity between parasites and their hosts; specificity between intermediate and definitive hosts; or how variations in host abundance affects parasite dynamics. Finally, we will introduce future avenues of research that will be needed to carry out, in order to understand the ultimate mechanisms shaping parasite communities in Macaronesia.

At a Westland petrel (Procellaria westlandica) breeding colony on mainland New Zealand, the concentration of Se in petrel guano (3.6 mg kg–1) exceeded soil parent material (0.8 mg kg–1) and in all but two soil samples (range 1.2–4.2 mg kg–1; n = 52). External Se (Se not derived from parent material) accounted for 64 ± 9% (mean ± s.d.) of soil Se. Measurements were also made at a former seabird breeding site, and at a site with no Holocene seabird breeding. Median surface-soil Se concentrations (mg kg–1) were in the order burrow soil (2.6) > adjacent forest floor (2.2) > former breeding site (1.0) > control site (0.2), with significant differences between burrow soil and (1) the former breeding site and (2) the control site. In a linear regression model, soil pH, and δ15N were the only significant predictors of external Se in colony soil. The correlations are consistent with seabird input driving both the Se supply and increased sorptive uptake in an environment acidified by seabird guano. Despite the enhanced Se in colony soil, median foliage concentrations (tree fern 0.05 mg kg–1, nikau 0.08 mg kg–1) were close to the accepted minimum for herbivore nutrition.

",,,,"Environmental contaminants can have profound effects on birds, acting from the molecular through population levels of biological organization. An analysis of potential contaminant threats was undertaken at 52 Important Bird Areas (IBAs) within the northeastern Atlantic coast drainage. Using geographic information system methodology, data layers describing or integrating contamination (impaired waters, fish or wildlife consumption advisories, toxic release inventory sites, and estimates of pesticide use) were overlaid on buffered IBA boundaries, and the relative threat at each site was ranked. Some species of birds residing at Jefferson National Forest (NF), Stewart B. McKinney National Wildlife Refuge (NWR), Great Dismal Swamp NWR, Blue Ridge Parkway, Shenandoah National Park (NP), Adirondack Park, Edwin B. Forsythe NWR, George Washington NF, Green Mountain NF, Long Island Piping Plover Beaches, and Merrymeeting Bay may be threatened by environmental contaminants. These sites exhibited moderate to high percentages of impaired waters and had fish consumption advisories related to mercury and polychlorinated biphenyls, and were located in counties with substantial pesticide use. Endangered, threatened, and Watch List bird species are present at these sites. The Contaminant Exposure and Effects–Terrestrial Vertebrates database was searched within buffered IBA boundaries, and for a moderate number of sites there was concordance between the perceived risk and contaminant exposure. Several of the IBAs with apparently substantial contaminant threats had no avian ecotoxicological data (e.g., George Washington NF, Shenandoah NP). Based upon this screening level risk assessment, contaminant biomonitoring of birds is warranted at such sites, and data generated from these efforts could foster natural resource management activities.","1551-3777

",,"Cambridge University Press
",,,,"Abstract Sub-Antarctic Marion Island's glacial history has acted as a control on abiotic terrestrial processes and the colonization and distribution of biotic species found on the island today. Recent chronological studies have shown an early deglaciation of the island and identified new geomorphological features associated with past ice dynamics. These permit a reassessment of ice extent during and after the island's last local glacial maximum. In this paper, we provide a revised reconstruction of the island's palaeo-ice extent by using a geomorphology-based approach to delineate palaeo-ice margins and demarcate possible glacial basins. The model presented here provides the needed spatial context for future studies on the variations in the distribution of species (e.g. microorganisms and plant species) and abiotic processes and forms (e.g. soil development and periglacial landforms). In addition, it highlights areas that require improved geophysical assessment in order to produce a more complete island-scale reconstruction of former ice extents (e.g. the west coast).

In Taiwan, forests cover almost 2/3 of the total area of the island, but the detail forest soil survey was conducted from 1993 to 2002 by Taiwan Forestry Research Institute (TFRI). Based on the forest soil survey database and former studies, the aims of this study were (1) to calculate the current forest SOC stocks in the major Soil Orders; (2) to estimate total forest SOC pools in different depths; (3) to examine the regional SOC stocks in andic soil landscape and SOC stocks along an elevation gradient in plantation forest; and (4) to propose the strategies of SOC sequestration in the forest soils. The major Soil Order distributed in the Taiwan forest soils are Inceptisols and Entisols. The mean forest SOC, excluding Histosols and Spodosols, is 18.5 kg m -2 (0-100 cm). The total forest SOC pools to the depth of 100 cm calculated from soil surface are about 160 Tg. In addition, in plantation forest in northern Taiwan the SOC stocks increased with elevation increased (p < 0.01), and temperature has significantly influences. The study in andic soil landscape in Yangmingshan National Park suggested that the man SOC storage of volcanic ash soils in Taiwan was 15.7 kg m -2 (0-100 cm). Based on the regional soil map (1600 ha in Tatunshan and 400 ha in Chishingshan), the SOC pool was 55.2 and 269 Gg/0-100 cm in Tatungshan and 48.5 and 32.5 Gg/0-100 cm in Chishingshan for Andisols and Inceptisols, respectively. The digital soil mapping (DSM) of SOC is important for examining the spatial distribution and stocks of SOC. The case study of DSM in Laoulongshi Forest Working Circles showed that the SOC stock in 0-100 cm soil layer was mostly less than 300 Mg ha -1 (ton ha -1) and the estimatied SOC pool was about 10.9 Tg (0-100 cm). A lack of bulk density data is a common problem for estimation of global soil C stocks. We suggested that the database of lower soil taxonomic categories and the SOC variability within and among soil pedons of the same soil type are strong need for estimation of SOC stocks in Taiwan. In order to increase the amount of C sequestration, old growth plantation forests have to thinning. The case study of reforestation at different time after forest fire suggested that reforestation immediately after forest fire could sequestrate more C, especially in the litter layer.",,,,,,,,,,,,No,,,,fun,,baseline,0.7670659340918065,1,0.378250251879125,0.8,4,808.0

",,,,"The introduction of carnivores to islands affects the conservation status of native prey. For two decades, American mink (Neogale vison) has expanded its distribution in the sub-Antarctic archipelago of Austral Patagonia, while preying on nests of solitary ground-nesting birds. Here, upland geese (Chloephaga picta) and flightless steamer ducks (Tachyeres pteneres) are naïve to such predation risk because of the lack of native terrestrial predators. We used nest occupancy models to reveal preferred breeding habitats of those two ground-nesting waterbirds to prioritize areas for future mink control programs. We searched for nests along 80 transects on Navarino Island, southernmost Chile, and 11 transects on 10 nearby islets (3 ± 2.9 ha). Our results showed that islets were essential for breeding in comparison to the main island (5.3 nests/km versus 0.8 nests/km, respectively). The occupancy models revealed that islets were particularly important for flightless steamer ducks, endemic to western Patagonia. As breeding habitat, upland geese preferred medium-dense shrubland, and flightless steamer ducks preferred rocky coastlines. Nest detection was negatively affected by dense vegetation and, in the case of the upland geese, towards the end of the survey. Ten camera traps (n = 385 trap nights) revealed mink presence on all islets, highlighting their capacity to swim in cold water, up to 340 m distance from the main island. We conclude that islets represent breeding refugees for ground-nesting waterbirds and therefore advocate allocating resources for mink control during the warm season on islets. We also provide predictive maps of nesting habitat preference of upland geese and flightless steamer ducks for conservation managers to focus their often-scarce human and financial resources on areas critical for breeding. Finally, we argue that detection probability should be an integral part of bird breeding studies, which can be methodologically achieved through targeting transects, not nests, as sample units.

",,,,,,"Antarctic Peninsula has been considered one of the most rapidly warming parts of our planet during the second half of the 20th century. Therefore, James Ross Island located near the northern tip of the Antarctic Peninsula, represents a unique place to study the sensitivity of glacier systems to regional atmospheric warming. Since 2006, an integrated multidisciplinary study of glaciers and terrestrial ecosystems has been carried out in the northern part of Ulu Peninsula, James Ross Island. In this contribution, glacier monitoring network consisting of four dominant land-based glaciers at the Ulu Peninsula is presented. Davies Dome (DD) is an ice dome, which originates on the surface of a flat volcanic mesa at >400 m a.s.l. and terminates as a single 700 m wide outlet in Whisky Bay. In 2006, Davies Dome had an area of 6.5 km2 and lay in the altitude range 0-514 m a.s.l. Whisky Glacier (WG) is a cold-based land-terminating valley glacier, which is surrounded by an extensive area of debris-covered ice. WG covered an area of 2.4 km2 and ranged from 215 to 520 m a.s.l. Triangular Glacier (TG) is a southwest-facing land-terminating glacier with an area of 0.6 km2 ranging from 302 to 107 m a.s.l. with well-developed ice-cored terminal moraine. San Jose Glacier (SJG) is a south-facing land-terminating piedmont glacier rejuvenated from the above lying Lachman Crags Dome (~640 m a.s.l.). SJG covers an area of 0.6 km2 and extends between 138 and 310 m a.s.l. Moreover, monitoring network consists of five automatic weather stations (AWS) placed in the central and marginal parts of the selected glaciers. Each AWS was equipped with the EMS33 air temperature and humidity probes placed inside the radiation shields. Apart from that, additional instruments, e.g. albedometer, propeller anemometer, snow depth sensors were installed on the central part of DD and WG. Since 2009, annual mass balance measurements have been realized on the DD, WG and TG glaciers. In 2010, ice thickness and glacier bed elevations of DD and WG were surveyed using ground-penetrating radar. The results of glaciological measurements over the period 2009-2014 reveal mostly positive annual mass balance on DD and WG except for the glaciological year 2011-2012 when net accumulation was recorded in the uppermost part of both glaciers. Spatial variability in annual mass balance is larger on DD where snow distribution and net accumulation is strongly determined by meteorological conditions. By contrast, interannual changes in spatial pattern of net balance are reduced on WG due to the topographic control of snow accumulation.

",,,,"The mechanisms underlying stabilization of soil organic matter (SOM) in vegetated coastal ecosystems, including mangrove forests, are poorly understood, limiting our ability to predict the consequences of disturbances. Here, we introduce density fractionation to mangrove soils to identify the distribution and properties of the functional components of SOM regarding degradation state, stability, and origin, namely, the free low-density fraction (f-LF), mineral-associated LF (m-LF), and high-density fraction (HF). Three soil cores (1 m) were collected in a mangrove forest on Ishigaki Island, Japan, and cut into 10 cm intervals and analyzed. Although HF was the most abundant, the massive production of mangrove fine roots resulted in a high abundance of LFs throughout the cores, which markedly differed from terrestrial soils. Relative abundance of LFs together accounted for 38–66% of total soil C. The m-LF was as abundant as f-LF and 1.6 times higher in relative abundance than the global average of terrestrial soils. The C/N ratios and δ13C values clearly increased with depth in all fractions, which was attributed to the increased contribution from roots. We found a consistent pattern in Δ14C values of density fractions. HF was the oldest with Δ14C between −149‰ and −97‰ followed by m-LF (between −130‰ and −87‰) and then f-LF (between −89‰ and 78‰), suggesting that mineral association may be pivotal in long-term carbon storage in the mangrove mineral soil. Our analysis successfully identified meaningful functional components of mangrove SOM, yet several questions remained unanswered, including a large variability in Δ14C in different cores. Future studies would benefit from a coupled analysis of the quantity and quality of density fractions and geochemical factors in mangrove soils.

",,,,"During the ongoing sixth global extinction wave, island ecosystems are among the most impacted due to a high introduction rate of non-native species (Tershy et al., 2015; Bellard, Cassey, & Blackburn, 2016; Fernández-Palacios et al., 2021). Within one of the global biodiversity hotspots (Myers et al., 2000), the Caribbean Lesser Antilles are known for their high degree of endemism across numerous taxa, including reptiles (e.g., Smith et al., 2004; Losos et al., 2006). However, continuing introductions of non-native species are homogenizing the regional herpetofauna diversity (Capinha, Marcolin, & Reino, 2020), leading to extinctions and loss of functional trait diversity across islands and ecosystems (Kemp, 2023). The most common terrestrial non-native vertebrates, throughout the Lesser Antilles, are reptiles (Thorpe, 2022). Their interactions with native reptile species have led to local extinctions and continuing declines in both native population sizes and distribution ranges through predation, hybridization, disease transmission, and competition for resources (Daltry, 2022). Multiple non-native species have already spread nearly regionwide, including Gymnophthalmus underwoodi, Hemidactylus mabouia, Indotyphlops braminus, Anolis/Norops sagrei, and Latin American Iguana iguana (Thorpe, 2022; Thibaudier et al., 2023; van den Burg et al., 2023), while others are spreading rapidly (e.g., Hemidactylus frenatus: Thibaudier et al., 2023 and references therein). Importantly, several of these non-native species are known to have been introduced to the Lesser Antilles from non-native populations in Florida (Powell et al., 2011); a pattern we fear is likely to be repeated by Peters's Rock Agama (Agama picticauda), although no established population has yet been reported in the Lesser Antilles. Agama picticauda is a medium-sized lizard native to sub-Saharan western and central Africa, with both sexual dichromatism and size dimorphism. Adult males have a bright orange head and tail, while females are light brown and can have yellow to orange dorsolateral patches (Fig. 1). The species is diurnally active, has a maximum recorded snout–vent length of 15.7 cm (Krishnan et al., 2019), and can produce up to three clutches annually, each of 5–12 eggs (Blunden & Krysko, 2007; Krysko, Enge, & Moler, 2019). It occupies both horizontal and vertical surfaces from where it uses a sit-and-stalk approach to identify and pursue arthropods (Enge, Krysko, & Talley, 2004) and small vertebrates (Henigan et al., 2019). In Florida, the first A. picticauda population was found in 1976 (Wilson & Porras, 1983) and it has since extended its range across the state (Enge, Krysko, & Talley, 2004). Recent analyses show high genetic variation within the Florida population due to introductions from different native origins (Nuñez, Krysko, & Avery, 2016). Given populations across its native range occupy different climatic niches (Krishnan et al., 2019), hybridization between populations of differing origins could result in high ecological adaptability (Consuegra et al., 2011), that in turn can increase establishment success when Florida individuals are translocated to other regions. Alarmingly, A. picticauda appears to be spreading to Caribbean islands as sightings are being reported from the Bahamas and Tortola (British Virgin Islands) (observations 139983395 and 89972864, https://www.inaturalist.org/). On Tortola, at least two adults as well as three juveniles have been observed, suggestive of an establishing population (C. Petrovic, pers. obs.). Further research on the status and impacts on the Bahamas is urgently needed, while on Tortola immediate action is necessary to remove the existing population. Although the native and non-native dietary range and ecology of A. picticauda are poorly studied, when it spreads to the Lesser Antilles, this could have a major impact on numerous native species. There is clear evidence this species preys on smaller lizards. For example, Henigan et al. (2019) dissected a large female that had cannibalized a smaller individual (5 cm snout–vent length) and Florida residents have observed predation of Anolis species (e.g., iNaturalist record 19472282), and a predation attempt on an Ameiva ameiva (J. Wasilewski pers. obs.). These data are highly troubling given many taxa have life stages within these size ranges, while others (or at least one sex) never grow larger. Species of Alinea, Anolis, Bachia, Capitellum, Copeoglossum, Gymnophthalmus, Mabuya, Marisora and Spondylurus would be susceptible to predation, as well as juveniles of Ameiva, Cnemidophorus, Kentropyx and Pholidoscelis: an assemblage of >45 species (Thorpe, 2022). Furthermore, native adult lizards are likely to experience interspecific competition and potential displacement. Although Agama picticauda is mainly reported from urban and suburban environments, suggesting a low impact within intact forests, given the high threat to the Caribbean forests and their transition to (sub)urban areas, it is expected that A. picticauda could become widely distributed. Besides, not all native Lesser Antillean species are limited to forests, as (pet-free) suburban gardens can also act as important habitats or even sanctuaries for critically endangered reptiles (e.g., Debrot, Boman, & Madden, 2013). Finally, given the abundance of A. picticauda in Florida and the high volume of shipments from Florida to ports throughout the Caribbean, we strongly emphasize the responsibility of state authorities (including border control), as well as transport and shipping providers, to prevent animals from leaving those shores. Florida-based conservationists and alien species experts, with A. picticauda experience, are encouraged to help Lesser Antillean stakeholders and authorities through training and knowledge transfer to tackle this major threat to Caribbean biodiversity.

Documenting the aerial plankton of Isla del Coco will allow to better understand the colonization process of this highly diverse island. Objective: Characterize the aerial plankton present on the transect Puntarenas – Isla del Coco. Methods: Specimens were collected using entomological nets on 2 roundtrip voyages during the months of July and August of 2017 and 2018, respectively. Results: A total of 10 morpho-species were collected corresponding to the orders: Diptera (Ceratopogonidae, Milichiidae, and Nematocera of a non-identified family), Hymenoptera (Chalcidoidea: Agaonidae), Hemiptera (Scutelleridae and Coreidae) and Lepidoptera (Sphingidae). Diptera and Hymenoptera were collected on the nets; while, Hemiptera and Lepidoptera were found on the deck of the boat. No spiders were collected. The Diptera and Hymenoptera families, as well as the family Coreidae (Hemiptera), have been previously recorded on this type of surveys across the tropical Pacific. Conclusions: Two of the taxa collected by nets, Ceratopogonidae (Diptera) and Chalcidoidea (Hymenoptera), have representatives on Isla del Coco, which could provide direct support for wind dispersal as a colonization mechanism for these groups. We also detected other insects (i.e. Lepidoptera and Scutelleridae-Hemiptera) which most likely reached the boat by their own means providing evidence of their dispersal abilities. This research provides data to further expand on questions about the mechanisms of island colonization.

We found that the number of lemming nests was highest in areas with a high proportion of Dryas heath, but was also correlated with other vegetation types, suggesting some flexibility in resource use of wintering lemmings. Furthermore, lemmings showed a higher use for sloped terrain, probably as it enhances the formation of deep snow drifts, which increases the insulative characteristics of the snowpack and protection from predators. With global warming, prime lemming winter habitats may become scarce through alteration of snow physical properties, potentially resulting in negative consequence for the whole community of terrestrial vertebrates.

",,"Wiley
",,,,"Plant phylogeographic data from the Patagonian Channels are scant and it is largely unknown how the extensive Quaternary glaciations affected the population dynamics of the region's major vegetation component, that is cushion peat bogs (Magellanic moorland). Whether ice-age glaciers wiped out all terrestrial plant life or whether some populations persisted in situ remains unclear. We reconstructed the phylogeography of two dominant Patagonian cushion peat bog species, Astelia pumila (G.Forst.) Gaudich. (Asteliaceae) and Donatia fascicularis J.R.Forst. & G.Forst. (Stylidiaceae), to test (a) the hypothesis of a glacial refugium for moorland plants in south-central Chile and (b) the tabula rasa scenario for the Patagonian Channels. The retrieved phylogeographic patterns were compared with those reported previously for a further cushion peat bog species (Pfanzelt et al., Molecular Ecology 26, 4027–4044), with the objective to provide a broader picture of how West Patagonian moorland plants responded to the Quaternary ice-ages.

Location
West and Fuegian Patagonia, and the Falkland Islands (Islas Malvinas), southern South America.

Methods
DNA sequence data from seven and fourteen, respectively, nuclear loci containing Simple Sequence Repeats of 371 and 328 individuals of the two study species were analysed using population genetic summary statistics, phylogenetic networks and Bayesian and multivariate methods to determine genetic structure. Ecological niche modelling was used to reconstruct the spatial distribution of suitable habitat at the Last Glacial Maximum.

Results
All A. pumila populations belong to a single population genetic cluster. In the case of D. fascicularis, only the northernmost sampled population from Nahuelbuta (Chile) is genetically distinct, whereas the remainder forms a cluster without much further substructure. According to palaeodistribution models, south-central Chile offered suitable habitat during the last glacial.

Main conclusion
Both ecological niche modelling and the very low genetic subdifferentiation are congruent with a tabula rasa scenario for the Patagonian Channels. Populations survived the last glacial in south-central Chile, in an area to the northwest of the ice sheet. From there, southern regions were recolonized through highly bottlenecked source populations. Other, non-mutually exclusive factors may have further shaped the population genetic patterns, among them high gene flow mediated by the strong westerly winds.

","Khan, Ibrahim; Islam, M.",,,,,2006.0,,,,,,,,,,,,"All Days
",,,,,,"Sundarbans mangrove ecosystem, the world largest mangrove forest in Bangladesh, is one of the most productive and biologically diverse wetlands in the world. This unique coastal tropical forest is among the most threatened habitats on earth. Its importance lies in its floristic composition, resource and economic value and precious wildlife reserve. It is a habitat of some 40,000 wildlife species including endangered royal Bengal tigers, rare freshwater dolphins, and crocodiles. It is a nursing and breeding ground of over 340 fish species and 250 bird species and many others.

This paper critically examines the present status of the Sundarbans and assesses the potential threat of oil and gas exploration. Every aspect of the exploration and development of oil and gas is analyzed and the magnitude of the impact quantified. In addition detailed guidelines and mitigation plans that will minimize potential impacts are addressed. A case study is done in the Sundarbans mangrove and it shows that by undertaking proper protection and mitigation measures, oil and gas operations can be developed by preserving ecological quality and protecting wildlife. Since there is limited research that focuses on environmentally sensitive areas, this work can serve as a basis for understanding the potential effects and required remediation of oil and gas in an environmentally sensitive ecosystem.

The findings of this case study are applicable in any environmentally sensitive area. This work is not intended for use in deciding whether or not to allow oil and gas development in the Sundarbans but rather, to aid in the identification of potential problems, to increase the manager's awareness of the implications of development, and to provide information that may facilitate minimization of harmful effects.",,,,,,"https://doi.org/10.2118/103269-ms

The paper concludes, that the present system of using species richness of flora and fauna in most Criteria and Indicator systems for Sustainable Forest Management should be improved. In order to improve monitoring systems a protocol should be developed, that includes monitoring of vegetation characteristics, and some selected fauna indicators. The use of avian guilds is proposed for consideration in future monitoring, since these: 1) represent energy and nutrient flows in the forest ecosystems 2) can be calculated from existing species lists with relatively little effort and 3) are therefore relatively cost effective Although understory insectivores seem to form the most sensitive group when it comes to logging disturbance, other guilds should also be considered. The analysis of species composition per forest dependent bird guild in Northern Sierra Madre Natural Park (NSMP) and in three other field-sites showed significant differences between the sites. It is suggested that these data may form a base-line for a future experimental monitoring programme in these different sites. For the future use of avian guilds for monitoring in the selected sites, trends in diversity and abundance of the guilds in space and time should be included. Point counts, implemented preferably by experienced bird watchers, seem to be the best census technique to quickly asses the effects of habitat disturbance on birds, although transect counts may be practicable too when investigating trends over time. Mist netting could be of additional value for some specific understory groups. When assessing habitat alteration, it is important to include vegetation in the analysis.

",,"Wiley
",,,,"Abstract Most seabird species nest colonially on cliffs or islands with limited terrestrial predation, so that oceanic effects on the quality or quantity of prey fed to chicks more often determine nest success. However, when predator access increases, impacts can be dramatic, especially when exposure to predators is extended due to slow growth from inadequate food. Kittlitz’s Murrelet ( Brachyramphus brevirostris ), a rare seabird having experienced serious declines, nests solitarily on the ground in barren, often alpine areas where exposure to predators is generally low. Nestling growth rates are exceptionally high and nestling periods very short relative to other Alcidae. This strategy reduces duration of exposure to predators, but demands adequate deliveries of high‐energy prey. In an area where foxes can access nests, we investigated whether varying energy content of prey fed to chicks could alter growth rates and resulting duration of predator exposure, and whether prolonged exposure appreciably reduced nest success. From 2009 to 2016, we monitored 139 nests; 49% were depredated (almost all by foxes) and 25% fledged. Prey fed to nestlings were 80% Pacific sand lance ( Ammodytes personatus ) and 19% capelin ( Mallotus villosus ), with capelin having 2.3× higher energy content per fish. In a year of slow chick growth, increased sand lance energy density of 31% (4.29–5.64 kJ/g, within published values), or increased proportion of capelin in the diet from 5.6% to 27.2%, would have allowed maximum chick growth. Maximum growth rates were attainable by delivering only 1.9 capelin/d versus 5.5 sand lance/d. Slow growth increased time to fledging by up to 5 d, decreasing survival by 7.7% (0.142–0.131). Breeding propensity of Kittlitz’s Murrelet averages only 20%, so even small changes in nest success could affect populations. Although nest success was limited mainly by predation, oceanic effects on prey quantity and quality had overriding impacts in one year (2015 heat wave), and small but substantive effects in other years by mediating exposure to predation. Climate warming that decreases availability of high‐energy forage fish, or increases expansion of predators into nesting habitats, may disproportionately affect this sensitive species and others with predator‐accessible nests and demands for energy‐rich prey.

",,,,"ABSTRACT Measuring the outcome of practical interventions and actions helps to inform conservation management objectives and assess progress towards objectives and targets. Measuring success also informs future management by identifying actions that are effective and those that are not. Scrub vegetation is an important habitat type in terrestrial ecosystems, providing important shelter and food resources for biodiversity and livestock. Much of practical land management in the UK involves the monitoring and management of scrub, and current drone‐based methods of scrub collection requires expensive equipment or complex methods. A 2021 paper determined a cheap and simple way to determine scrub levels, and this could potentially be used to map temporal changes, as well as identify directional change in scrub. This study looks at whether the method outlined in the 2021 study could be used to measure temporal and directional changes in scrub cover on two nature reserves in the UK: Daneway Banks in Gloucestershire and Flat Holm Island in the Severn Estuary. Scrub levels at Daneway Banks increased from 14.63% in 2015 to 16.52% in 2017, before decreasing to 14.89% in 2021 due to managed cutting and clearing. Scrub cover at Flatholm Island decreased from 10.18% in 2019 to 8.71% in 2021. The exact locations of scrub growth and loss for each site was also calculated and mapped. This approach was found to be a viable way of measuring temporal and directional change in scrub levels. The data can also be used to reframe changes in scrub levels as a shift towards vegetation succession or reduction, to better visualise how changes in scrub levels affect overall site management goals, and is a cheaper, more accessible alternative to current methods of measuring temporal vegetation changes.

",,,,"Abstract. To gain better insight into the cascading impact of warming-induced changes in the physical landscape on biodiversity, it is crucial to better understand links between abiotic and ecological processes governing species distribution. Abiotic processes shaping the physical characteristics of the environment could significantly influence predator movements in the landscape and ultimately affect biodiversity through interspecific interactions. In the Arctic tundra, the main terrestrial predator (Arctic fox) avoids patches of wetlands composed of ponds with islets that can act as refuges for prey. Little is known about the geomorphological processes generating islets selected by prey species. Our study aimed to identify (i) the physical characteristics of islets selected by Arctic-nesting birds and (ii) the geomorphological processes generating islets available in the landscape. Over two breeding seasons, we determined the occurrence of nesting birds (cackling goose, glaucous gull, and red-throated loon) on islets (N=396) found over a 165 km2 area on Bylot Island (Nunavut, Canada). Occupied islets were located further away from the shore (10.6 m ± 7.3 SD vs. 7.4 m ± 6.8 SD) and surrounded by deeper water (33.6 cm ± 10.6 SD vs. 28.1 cm ± 11.5 SD) than unoccupied islets. As expected, all three bird species selected islets less accessible to Arctic foxes, with nesting occurrence increasing with distance to shore and water depth around islets. Based on high-resolution satellite imagery and field observations, we found that ice-wedge polygon degradation generated the majority of islets (71 %) found in the landscape. Those islets were on average farther from the shore and surrounded by deeper water than those generated by other processes. As polygon degradation is projected to accelerate in response to warming, new refuges will likely emerge in the Arctic landscape, but current refuges could also disappear. Changes in the rate of polygon degradation may thus affect Arctic tundra biodiversity by altering predator–prey interactions.

A dramatic change in tetrapod distribution and ecology is coupled with an ongoing transition from amphibian to amniote domination. Presented here is a new set of tetrapod footprints from a single slab discovered on the island of Bjørnøya in the Norwegian High Arctic. A three-dimensional photogrammetric model was constructed to allow analysis of the trackway, and palaeoenvironmental observations were taken to provide context to the ichnological determinations. The slab appears to preserve the transition from swimming to walking. Statistical tests provide indication that there is a significant change in locomotive behaviour (swimming to walking) present on the slab (p = 0.0026, n = 15). This coincides with a change in the preservation style and an apparent change in the depth of water traversed by the tracemaker. Two trackways can be assigned to the ichnogenus Limnopus Marsh, 1894 (temnospondyl amphibians). They consist of 36 and 24 prints, respectively, and have widths and lengths of 151 mm x 2149 mm and 166 mm x 1226 mm. Two other trackways represent the traces of indeterminate tetrapods. Palaeoenvironmental analysis suggests that the trackways had lain in a fluvial floodplain setting in a palaeo-river valley system, in agreement with regional-scale analyses. Locomotion analysis suggests that on moving from submerged walking and swimming to terrestrial walking, this large Late Carboniferous temnospondyl increased its pace angulation and lengthened its stride. At ~30°N, these tracks may be the farthest north Limnopus trackways yet found in terms of palaeolatitude.

",,,,"Rediscovery of a species feared to be extinct generates conservation optimism and positive media attention. The hope of evading extinction contrasts with the gloom of the biodiversity crisis, although the outlook for rediscovered animals is in fact grim, particularly if they are small and uncharismatic species as is increasingly the case (Fisher, 2011a). To be rediscovered a species must first be missing, but how do we know when a species is missing, possibly undetected or possibly extinct? Scientifically documented yearly distributions of sightings vary among species and depend on search effort (Fisher & Blomberg, 2011), location remoteness in relation to searchers (who are typically not local practitioners in biodiversity hotspots (Fisher, 2011b)), identification expertise available, species distinctiveness, and features that affect conspicuousness of the animal such as body size and microhabitat (Fisher & Blomberg, 2011). In 1994, the IUCN recognised that the appropriate time missing to detect extinction varies between taxa. Based on the work of the late Prof. Georgina Mace and colleagues, the IUCN Red List definitions changed to reflect evidence-based criteria (IUCN, 1994). Now Species Survival Commission Specialist Groups and their expert assessors judge if search effort has been adequate and appropriate for each species. Authors typically provide this rationale in the Red List species account. A component of ‘appropriate’ surveys is of course the number of years of effort, but time missing is not an explicit criterion. Martin et al. (2022) acknowledge this complexity but have taken a simple approach to define lost terrestrial vertebrates (mammals, birds, amphibians and reptiles) as species not recorded by science for at least fifty years, evaluated in the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species, and not designated as EX (extinct). They identify 562 lost species, more than 90% of which are classified as Critically Endangered or Data Deficient by the IUCN. More than 90% of these lost species are tropical, concentrated especially in countries with diverse habitats, islands and mountain-tops where distributions are restricted, and remote forests, such as in Indonesia, Mexico and Brazil. Nearly a third of lost terrestrial vertebrates are island endemics and a third mountain endemics. More than 60% of EX species are island endemics (Spatz et al., 2022). In mammals, missing island endemics are extremely unlikely to ever be rediscovered because their small ranges are searchable, and the particularly lethal driver of invasive predators is their main cause of extinction (Fisher & Blomberg, 2011, Clavero & Garcia-Berthou, 2005), which suggests that many of the ~170 lost island endemics are extinct, although they lack a ‘Possibly Extinct’ flag. These findings enhance our understanding of extinction and suggest ways to improve the value of information in Red List accounts by increasing the use of the ‘Possibly Extinct’ flag. Martin et al. (2022) suggest that the PE flag should be applied more widely when consistent with recently published guidelines. They also propose that a separate last sighting date field in Red List accounts should be routinely included with species classified below Critically Endangered. These measures would help to quantify the change in status of lost species in future. This study also contributes to our understanding of extinction because it provides an independent source of evidence of reliable correlates of species extinction and detectability. There is a striking agreement between the approach of Martin et al. (2022) and other work on the numbers and features of missing and extinct terrestrial vertebrates. For example, despite different methods and thresholds, the conclusions of Martin et al. (2022) are remarkably similar to those of Re:wild (2022) (non peer-reviewed research published online by NGO Re:wild in collaboration with the IUCN and others). Re:wild researchers contacted SSC Species Specialist Groups to collate a list of species judged to be missing by taxon experts based on their knowledge of survey effort, taxonomy, and other factors. The Re:wild database thus broadly uses IUCN criteria, and includes ‘NE (not evaluated)’ species and ‘EX’ species judged to be lost by experts. Re:wild (2022) identified 1008 lost terrestrial vertebrates, and a third of the total lost species were NE. The taxon expert approach thus concluded a similar number of lost terrestrial vertebrate species to the 50-year rule approach applied by Martin et al. (2022), if we omit NE and EX species (excluded from Martin et al. definition of ‘lost’) from the Re:wild list. Martin et al. (2022) emphasised the worrying disparity between the proportion of lost and extinct reptiles, and show graphically that reptiles had more species still missing after longer time periods than other vertebrate classes, including reptile species lost for more than 170 years. They conclude that reptile extinction is likely to be under-diagnosed. Re:wild (2022) also agreed that by far the most represented class of missing species is reptiles (a third of the missing species in their database are reptiles, 582 species). Both conclude that the least represented class of lost species is birds, probably because bird extinction is most often correctly diagnosed. Martin et al. (2022) and Re:wild (2022) both showed that tropical taxa dominate lost species lists, especially in Indonesia. Methods to quantify extinction and its detection in vertebrates based on trait modelling, sighting distribution modelling, chronological Red List changes and literature reviews corroborate these numbers and the predominance of tropical species in the ‘lost’ category (e.g. Fisher & Blomberg, 2011, Fisher, 2011b, Scheffers et al., 2011, Butchart et al., 2018). Martin et al. (2022) advocated a dynamic and accessible list of lost species: This is also the main purpose of Re:wild's (2022) online database. The suggestion by Martin et al. (2022) to address taxonomic uncertainty by focusing on priority data-deficient lost species may be problematic because the reason for data deficiency in lost species is typically the lack of specimens. For example, Fisher & Blomberg (2012) found that 70% of missing/extinct mammals had five or fewer records and 45 species had only one record. However, Martin et al.'s (2022) recommendation to fund targeted searches for priority missing species makes sense, and is in agreement with conservation NGOs including Re:Wild and EDGE. Martin et al. (2022) recommended models to prioritise species that are most likely to be rediscovered and sites where they may occur, using attributes of lost /extinct and rediscovered taxa. This is also potentially useful; several such studies have been published for birds and mammals, and also plants, but not herpetofauna (e.g. Fisher, 2011b, Fisher & Blomberg, 2012, Butchart et al., 2018, Humphreys et al. 2019). This study re-enforces the importance of using a species-by-species approach to extract IUCN Red List data. Martin et al. (2022) and Re:wild (2022) both began by omitting potential lost species that have been seen in the last ten years, then (as in Fisher & Blomberg, 2011; Butchart et al., 2018) Martin et al. (2022) extracted relevant data by reading individual species accounts. Species Specialist Groups do not monitor species, but rather taxon experts provide assessments. SSGs are run by volunteers, so although there are some annual updates, it may take several years to draft new versions of individual species accounts, which are asynchronously built on prior versions. The content of species accounts varies, often with the quantitative information in the main text of the justification section or another field. Although time consuming, to avoid bias and incorrect conclusions, it is crucial to read every species account carefully and to check the primary sources (Clavero & Garcia-Berthou, 2005), as Martin et al. (2022) have done.

",,,,"The tundra and tundra barrens of the maritime Antarctica represent a unique type of terrestrial ecosystem, geographically confined to the region of the Antarctic Peninsula and a number of surrounding archipelagos. Antarctic soils are underestimated in the quantity of organic matter (OM) pools, organic remnant humification/mineralization rates, and biogenic-abiogenic interactions. The structure of reserves for humic substances within the permafrost zone, as well as the role of the molecular composition of organic substances, are still poorly understood. In this study, we investigate humic acids of selected sub-Antarctic soils in terms of elemental and structural composition to evaluate OM stabilization degree and to assess carbon distributions in the molecules by solid-state CP/MAS 13C NMR and ESR spectroscopy. The results obtained show that the studied humic acids consist mainly of aliphatic structural fragments. According to ESR spectroscopy, it was noted that the most stable molecules by the data of ESR spectroscopy are formed in postornithogenic soils. In contrast, the average portion of the aromatic compounds is about 30% in humic acids, extracted from soils with evident ornithogenic effect.

",,,,,,"Nest predation by invasive mammalian predators can cause major impacts on native bird populations. The American mink (Neovison vison) was recently introduced on Navarino Island in southern Chile. The mink established as a new terrestrial mesopredator on the island with documented impacts on waterfowl breeding success. However, little is known about mink effects on forest bird’s reproduction. Here, we investigated nest-predation rate by native predators and the invasive mink on open-cup nesting forest birds by using artificial and natural nests. In six different plots, we deployed a grid (7 x 2) of 14 artificial nests spaced by 50 m and at random heights from the ground. We used camera traps in each nest to identify predators. At each plot, we estimated predator relative abundance using camera traps, Sherman traps, and bird point counts. We estimated nest survival probability as a function of nest age, concealment, distance to the river, and nest height. Additionally, we monitored 43 natural nests of five open-cup nesting bird species. Contrary to expected, mink was not a main predator of nests, depredating only one natural nest. The native raptor Chimango Caracara (Milvago chimango) was the main nest predator, preying on 39.8% artificial nests and 27.0% natural nests. We also found evidence that Chimango Caracara learned to associate the artificial nests with the egg reward. We argue that the lower abundance of mink in the forest and a mismatch between mink peak activity patterns and bird breeding phenology can result in low depredation. Mink impacts, however, may be more pervasive in summer months and on fledglings when mink activity peaks, and more research should be conducted to assess these questions. Our results are valuable to better understand mink impacts on biodiversity and to prioritize conservation actions on species more severely affected.

",,,,"By the mid 1980s, concerns about ozone depletion by chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and ensuing increases in ultraviolet-B radiation (UV-B) reaching the earth's surface prompted urgent research to examine the effects of UV-B on plant processes. Although international agreements have now slowed the production of CFCs, whether stratospheric ozone and UV-B levels will revert to the preozone-depletion levels of the 1970s by the end even of this century remains uncertain because of noncompliance and the positive feedback that greenhouse gases may have on ozone depletion (Madronich et al., 1998; Shindell et al., 1998). However, our ability to predict the impacts of changing UV-B levels on organisms and ecosystem processes is limited because few field studies have examined effects across multiple trophic levels. In this issue, Searles et al. (2001b) (see pp. 213–221) examine how solar UV-B influences plants and microbes at the southern extremity of South America, the Tierra del Fuego archipelago – an area that is experiencing enhanced solar UV-B levels during spring and summer due to the Antarctic ozone hole. Counterintuitively – since UV-B is deemed detrimental to most organisms – they found that some microbes, in particular testate amoebae, occur in higher numbers in a Sphagnum peatland under near-ambient UV-B than under reduced UV-B levels. Less surprisingly, these findings reemphasize that what we know about UV-B effects on plants cannot easily be extrapolated to predict how UV-B will affect other trophic levels in a system.","0028-646X

",,,,"The Arctic is an accumulation zone of long-range transported pollution. In addition, local anthropogenic activities further contribute to regional pollution levels. The Svalbard reindeer (Rangifer tarandus platyrhynchus) is a suitable organism for studying and monitoring exposure to anthropogenic pollutants at the base of the terrestrial Arctic food web, and reindeer faeces have been promoted as non-invasive means of biomonitoring contaminant exposure. This study used HR-ICP-MS to analyse levels and composition of 16 elements in Svalbard reindeer faeces (n = 96) and soil (n = 9) from two locations on Svalbard, with the aim to assess whether local anthropogenic pollution influences element bioavailability. One of the sampling areas, the Nordenskiöld coast, is situated on the west coast of Spitsbergen, close to the Arctic Ocean and relatively far from local anthropogenic sources. The other sampling area, Adventdalen, is located further inland and close to Longyearbyen, the largest settlement of the archipelago. There was a significant difference in faecal elemental concentration and composition between the Adventdalen and Nordenskiöld coast reindeer populations. Elements of geogenic origin (e.g., Al, Cu and Fe) were found at higher levels in faeces from Adventdalen. In comparison, levels of Ca, Se and the toxic elements Cd and Pb were higher in faecal samples from the Nordenskiöld coast. The significantly higher levels of faecal Cd and Pb at Nordenskiöld coast may be due to marine input, dietary differences between the populations, or possible anthropogenic influence from the nearby settlement of Barentsburg. There was, however, a decoupling in elemental composition between faecal and soil samples, which may derive from a selective vegetational uptake of elements from the soil. The results suggest that reindeer are exposed to a range of elements and that faeces can be used to monitor the exposure to bioavailable environmental levels of both essential and toxic elements in terrestrial ecosystems.

",,,,"Abstract Fungi are probably the most diverse group of eukaryotic organisms in the Antarctic continent and nearby archipelagos, and they dominate communities in either mild or harsh habitats. However, our knowledge of their global distribution ranges and the temporal origins of their Antarctic populations is rather limited or almost absent, especially for species that do not lichenize. We focused for the first time on elucidating the taxonomic identity and phylogenetic relationships of several Antarctic collections of the deadly fungal Basidiomycota genus Galerina . By using molecular sequence data from the universal fungal barcode and a dataset encompassing 178 specimens, the inferred phylogeny showed that the Antarctic specimens corresponded with the sub-cosmopolitan species Galerina marginata , Galerina badipes and Galerina fallax , and their most closely related intraspecific genetic lineages were from northern Europe and North America. We found that these species probably host Antarctic-endemic intraspecific lineages. Furthermore, our dating analyses indicated that their Antarctic populations originated in the Pleistocene, a temporal frame that agrees with that proposed for the Antarctic colonization of plants such as the grass Deschampsia antarctica , mosses and some amphitropical lichens. Altogether, these findings converge on the same temporal scenario for the assembly of the most conspicuous terrestrial Antarctic plant and fungal communities.

",,,,,,"The Antarctic hairgrass (Deschampsia antarctica É. Desv.) is one of two flowering plants native to the Antarctic and therefore it was intensively studied for decades. However, there is still limited information available about the content of biogenic and toxic elements in the leaves of this plant. While being an important component of the Antarctic terrestrial ecosystems, the content of nutrients like K, P, and S in the plants of D. antarctica may significantly affect soil properties, especially in such hot spots like rhizosphere and detritosphere. Moreover, the content of toxic elements and trace metals in particular in the plant is an important criterion to evaluate its indicative role, whether or not D. antarctica may be used as a bio-indicator to monitor the Antarctica environmental state. In this study, we report the preliminary results about the content of K, P, Ca, S, Mg, Na, Si, Fe, Zn, Al, Sr, Mn, Cu, B, Cr, Ba, V, Pb, Cd, and Co in the leaves of D. antarctica from the natural habitats of the maritime Antarctіс. Dry leaves were digested in nitric acid (closed-vessel microwave digestion). Elemental concentration was measured by ICP-OES technique. It was found that differences between the samples taken from one location were far less notable than between samples from different locations. Among the biogenic elements, the content of potassium was the most variable – from 12.2 mg·g-1 on Galindez Island to 28.7 mg·g-1 on the Cape Tuxen (Antarctic Peninsula). The content of trace metals also varied greatly between the samples from different locations. The results of this preliminary study suggest that due to the high content of nutrients, leaves of D. antarctica should be considered as an important precursor of soil organic matter, as well as a possible bioindicator. However, future studies are needed to confirm these preliminary results and hypotheses.

",,,,"Alfred Russel Wallace is properly regarded as the father of modern biogeography. Although best known today as the co-founder of the theory of natural selection, his writings were as interdisciplinary as is today's biogeography – incorporating evolution, ecology, geology and glaciology into the grand task of explaining the geographical distribution and diversification of taxa and biotas on a dynamic earth [for a compilation of highlights of his work, I can highly recommend Berry's (2002) anthology]. Wallace developed many of the major principles still in use in biogeography (summarized in box 2.1 in Lomolino et al., in press), and his thoughts on threats to – and strategies to protect – biodiversity would fit remarkably well within the emerging field of conservation biogeography (Whittaker et al., 2005). The International Biogeography Society (IBS) was formed in 2000 with the goals of (1) fostering communication and collaboration between biogeographers in disparate academic fields, (2) increasing both the awareness and interests of the scientific community and the lay public in the contributions of biogeographers, and (3) promoting the training and education of biogeographers so that they may develop sound strategies for studying and conserving the world's biota (see full mission statement at http://www.biogeography.org). In 2004, the IBS Board of Directors established the Alfred Russel Wallace Award to be presented every 2 years to a distinguished scholar for a lifetime of achievement in biogeography. It is particularly appropriate that the first Award was presented to Dr John (Jack) C. Briggs at the second biennial IBS Conference this past January. Much as for Wallace, one of the defining geographical centres of Jack's career has been the Indo-Australian (or Malay) Archipelago – one of the truly remarkable biodiversity hotspots on Earth. Wallace, of course, concentrated on terrestrial diversity, hopping from island to island across what became known as Wallace's Line, making vast collections of vertebrates and invertebrates alike, and penning his two most inspired theoretical works (the ‘Sarawak Law’ and ‘Ternate’ papers) during his stay in the region. Jack, however, has focused his attention on the marine realm and most notably has used a variety of evidence – including geographical gradients of species richness across the Indian and Pacific Oceans, molecular systematics and reconstructions of Earth history – to develop and defend a variety of hypotheses that involve speciation engines in centres of origin, with subsequent dispersal outwards. The centre he discusses in the following paper (Briggs, 2005) is the so-called East Indies Triangle (Wallacea). His career-long, unwavering adherence to dispersal as an important and analytical process in biogeography might strike some historical biogeographers as a return to the ad hoc scenario building of Matthew, Simpson and Darlington. However, Jack has always been careful to frame his work as testable hypotheses and to offer clear discussions of the sorts of evidence that would either support or refute them. The great influence of his creative thinking on marine biogeography was summarized by Brian Bowen in his tribute to Jack in the Spring 2005 IBS newsletter: The premier modern synthesis of marine species distributions arrived with Brigg's 1974 classic Marine Zoogeography…Most of [the issues currently being addressed by molecular biogeography and phylogeography] are explicitly formulated in Marine Zoogeography, and the number of phylogeographic studies that cite Briggs (1974) is beyond counting. In other words, it took about three decades for the science of biogeography to mature to the point that it could rigorously address the issues that Jack presented in 1974! Much of Wallace's work and his contributions to Victorian Age science have until recently been relatively unknown and underappreciated. Thanks to a handful of enthusiastic historians, his genius – and more importantly, his identity apart from Darwin – is beginning to emerge and crystallize. We owe a great deal of credit for this rediscovery of Wallace to Dr Charles H. Smith. Charles maintains a website (http://www.wku.edu/~smithch/home.htm) devoted to things Wallacean, and (Berry 2002, p. xvii) remarks that his web site ‘should serve as a model for all web-based archival projects. Smith's site is an essential port of call for anyone interested in Wallace’. But more than being just an indexer and bibliographer, Charles is a biogeographer (e.g. see Smith, 1986) and – as he demonstrates in the paper he presented at the second biennial IBS Conference as a prelude to presentation of the Wallace Award to Jack Briggs, and published in this issue (Smith, 2005) – offers a very interesting interpretation of what he believes to be fundamental differences between what Wallace and what Darwin had in mind regarding the role of natural selection in evolution. The IBS is a young society but has already made important contributions to the growth and coalescence of modern biogeography into a more synthetic and integrative discipline [e.g. two enthusiastically received conferences and two IBS-sponsored publications: Foundations of biogeography (Lomolino et al., 2004), Frontiers of biogeography: new directions in the geography of nature (Lomolino & Heaney, 2004)]. We will be sponsoring a meeting tentatively titled ‘Palaeogeography and Palaeobiogeography: Biodiversity in Space and Time’, being planned by organizers at the University of Cambridge for Spring 2006. Finally, we are beginning to organize our third biennial conference for January 2007, in the Canary Islands, at which time the second Wallace Award will be presented to Dr Jared Diamond. I invite any and all biogeographers to become members of IBS – membership forms and other information about IBS can be found at http://www.biogeography.org. Join today and help us build on the vision of a new scientific society devoted to facilitating the development of an ever better and more relevant science of biogeography! Brett R. Riddle is the President of the International Biogeography Society, 2005 and 2006.

1157.0,"Remote Sensing Model Development for Seagrass and Mangrove Carbon Stock Mapping
","Wicaksono, Pramaditya; Hartono, Dea.; Danoedoro, Projo",,,,,2015.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Among vegetated coastal habitats, seagrass and mangroves are the most effective blue carbon sink. The ability of these habitats to sequester CO2 from the atmosphere surpasses any terrestrial ecosystems considerably. However, continuous and spatial and temporally explicit information about the carbon stock of these habitats are currently lacking at various levels of scales and user needs, which is mainly due to the limitation and difficulties of performing field data collection. This highly demanding carbon stock information can only be obtained using remote sensing. The aims of this research are to map seagrass and mangroves carbon stock using remote sensing, develop remote sensing model for seagrass and mangroves carbon stock mapping, and estimate the total carbon stock of seagrass and mangroves carbon stock in Karimunjawa Islands. Worldview-2, ALOS AVNIR-2, ASTER VNIR, Landsat 5 TM, and Landsat 7 ETM+ images are selected to represent data at various level of mapping scales. Several geometric and radiometric approaches were applied to isolate seagrass and mangroves reflectance. Seagrass and mangroves carbon stock were mapped using semi empirical modeling. The input for seagrass carbon stock modeling are deglint bands, water column corrected bands, and PC bands, while for mangroves carbon stock modeling the inputs are vegetation index, PC bands, and image fraction from linear spectral unmixing, and spectral angle mapper. Field data are collected to build the model as well as to understand the relationship between seagrass and mangroves biophysical properties, which is also very important to construct the framework of the mapping. Remote sensing model for seagrass and mangroves carbon stock mapping was developed by considering the underlying framework, the effective input data, the assumptions and limitations during the mapping, the methodology to map the carbon stock, and the expected accuracy. The resulting model covers the logics behind the ability of remote sensing to explain the variation of seagrass and mangroves carbon stock and the technical mapping framework. The results show that remote sensing can be used to map seagrass and mangroves carbon stock. Seagrass carbon stock can be mapped with maximum accuracy of 49.23% (SE = 6.64 gC/m2), 55.64% (SE = 59.52% gC/m2), and 92.9% (SE = 17.41 gC/m2) for the AGC, BGC, and sediment carbon stock. For mangroves, the AGC, BGC, and soil carbon stock can be mapped with 77.81% (SE = 5.71 kgC/m2), 60.82% (SE = 2.48 kgC/m2), and 82.5% (SE = 1.22 kgC/m2) accuracy respectively. From the model, total ecosystem carbon stock in seagrass and mangroves in Karimunjawa Islands are estimated to be around 622.9 and 181,195.88 tones of organic carbon respectively. The availability of remote sensing model for seagrass and mangroves carbon stock mapping is very important to provide better understanding about their spatiotemporal carbon dynamics distribution. In addition, carbon stock maps are beneficial to assist various management activities including determining protected zones, assisting the process of mangroves conservation, setting the baseline for natural resource inventory, and evaluating management impacts.",,,,,,,,,,,,No,,includes mangroves,,"struct, fun",,,0.9866403102874756,1,0.008381981549985854,1.0,5,640.0

The present study focused on Hainan Island (HN), China, from 2010 to 2020, using soil organic carbon (SOC) and cation exchange capacity (CEC) to create an assessment system (S→) for soil degradation based on change vector analysis. A geographical detector was used to determine the mechanism of soil degradation on HN. The total area of soil degradation in the study period was 673.69 km2, being concentrated in the northeast. Areas of soil degradation in forest, cultivated land, construction land, grassland, and unutilized land measured 439.88 km2, 184.06 km2, 25.44 km2, 22.56 km2, and 1.75 km2, respectively. The single factors of elevation (DEM), least distance to a point of interest in residential areas (LDP), and variation in mean annual temperature (VTem) were significantly correlated with soil degradation in cultivated land and grassland, forest, and construction land, respectively. However, paired factors exhibited greater explanatory power. The pairs of DEM∩LDR (DEM + least distance to point of interest of road and railroad, LDR), LDP∩LDR, and VTem∩VGDP (VTem + variation in GDP density) had the most significant correlations with soil degradation in cultivated land and grassland, forest, grassland, and construction land, respectively (p < 0.01). The soil resources of HN should be protected in multiple ways, such as by expanding ecological protection zones in high-altitude grasslands and forests. Moreover, urban development goals should be clearly defined to limit rapid increases in road and settlement construction to protect cultivated land and constructed land.

East Asia’s land bridge dynamics and monsoon system during the Middle Pleistocene transition (MPT) further constrained species distributions and dispersals, which promoted local adaptation and species diversification, making East Asia an excellent location to study species biogeography. Cypripedium macranthos Sw., a terrestrial orchid, diverged in the Pleistocene and became widespread in Russia, China, Korea, and Japan. Many populations are now at risk due to illegal harvesting or habitat loss. With comprehensive sampling including 171 individuals among 22 populations across the entire distribution range, together with plastid DNA sequencing, we have explored the origin and impact of palaeoclimate on its spatial genetic structure and historical biogeography. Regression-based analyses commonly used in landscape genetics were also applied to investigate the effects of precipitation, temperature, and wind on gene flow. The results revealed northeastern China as the probable cradle of C. macranthos, with northeastward divergence and range expansion during the MPT, aided by monsoon shifts and wind-driven seed dispersal. Isolation by environment was detected with winter temperature as a driver for north–south divergence controlling for an effect of isolation by distance, revealing cold adaptation of the northern populations or temperature-driven genetic differentiation. We also emphasize the founder speciation of an unique variety on Rebun Island of Japan. The widespread but genetically and ecologically divergent C. macranthos populations highlight the need for more conservation attention on northern populations under global warming.","0024-4074

The investigations showed autogamy plays a less important role than thought, although a caging experiment showed that the species is well capable of self-pollination. The orchid is pollinated by a variety of small moths, especially of the families Geometridae, Pyralidae and Crambidae. It is flowering in a period when few other plants flower, so there is little competition for pollinators.

The system of agro-ecology illustrates a significant temporal and spatial distribution of various forms of land use, reflecting the interconnectedness of natural resource management and local social security. Varied cultural rules and practices on system of agro-ecology demonstrate the role of different units that support local ecology as well as social security of kin-groups. The paper also shows how recent agricultural, socio-economic and cultural changes have shaped the adaptation and strategies, and how present trends of the ethno-ecological zones affect human-environment relations and community relations and livelihoods which in turn also affect local social security.

",,,,"In 1966, graduate student Daniel Simberloff and advisor Edward O. Wilson set out to experimentally test MacArthur & Wilson's (1963, 1967) dynamic equilibrium theory, which predicted short-term “turnover” in species composition with unchanging species richness. Species composition had previously been assumed to be relatively stable in the short term. In a large-scale field manipulation, Simberloff and Wilson used large tents to fumigate red mangrove islands in Florida to remove existing insect communities. They then monitored re-colonization. Indeed, species richness recovered quickly (faster on less isolated islands), and substantial species turnover continued after species richness stabilized near the pre-experiment value. These experiments were among the first to reveal rapid ecological processes altering contemporary species richness and composition, helping to shift research paradigms to focus on underlying, ongoing processes. I was first exposed to the groundbreaking paper by Simberloff and Wilson (1969) during an undergraduate-level community ecology course taught by Dr. Greg Adler at the University of Wisconsin Oshkosh. The passion that was ignited in me by Dan and Ed's papers soon turned into an obsession. I began reading through the subsequent follow-up studies, the challenges, the applications, and I thirsted for more. This obsession culminated in a 25-page term paper, in which I put the classic experiment in the context of 40 years of follow-up studies and critically evaluated the strengths and weaknesses of the theory through the lens of modern community ecology. I vividly remember spending many late nights working on my term paper, often catching myself daydreaming that I was riding between the islands with Dan and Ed, setting up gigantic tents, observing the re-colonization of the islands, and following community dynamics. When I snapped out of these trances, it would take me a minute to realize that I wasn't navigating mangrove islands under the hot sun, but I was in a poorly lit basement computer laboratory at 2 a.m. in wintery Wisconsin. Unfortunately, my term paper is long gone saved on a floppy disk that was no doubt “filed” in a recycling bin. I wish I still had a copy so that I could reread the unbridled, scattered, ever-optimistic thoughts of an early ecologist trying to find his niche. Rereading through the papers today, I'm still captivated by the elegance and simplicity of Dan and Ed's experiment. When I discuss field ecology and experimental manipulations with students new to ecology, I still direct them toward their papers. I direct young ecologists to them in hopes that these papers will make a lasting impression, fueling a new generation of ecologists to tackle the daunting task of conducting large-scale field experimental manipulations just as they had for me. Young ecologists can learn from these papers as I did about how to conduct simple, but elegant experiments that test standing ecological theory. Nearly 50 years after the initial publication, Dan and Ed's papers are still inspiring young ecologists to not only work in remote, beautiful locations in adverse, challenging conditions, and to tackle the big questions in ecology. For me, Dan and Ed's papers push me to tackle how natural communities assemble, how biodiversity is maintained, and how community composition regulates ecosystem function. I will be forever grateful to Dan Simberloff and E. O. Wilson for inspiring me to follow in their gigantic footsteps. I remember standing on the beach on Midway Atoll, an isolated 6.2-km2 Pacific island and seabird colony. With millions of birds cackling behind me, I looked out at a sky and ocean of endless blues, and there on a wave a seed washed up, a propagule of the Indian coral tree Erythrina variegata. The vision of the seed immediately brought to mind Dan and Ed's experiments. I learned about the Theory of Island Biogeography in the 1990s, when outcomes of Dan and Ed's supporting experiments were well known. Subsequent discussion and the flurry of publications to follow had largely subsided. I read evidence indicating that immigration and extinction drive colonization and turnover in species composition and incorporated it as simple but clearly substantiated fact, fundamental in its application to natural systems. While natural systems had recognizable patterns, these were constantly in flux owing to interactions that could be historical, recent, and contemporaneous. It made perfect sense. With this bright and beautiful little bean here on the beach was I witnessing species turnover? Succession? The species was historically cultivated on Midway but not considered native; possible dispersal by Kuroshio and North Pacific currents serving Midway and the tree's native range might suggest it be designated as “native,” affording it elevated status and purportedly protection. But allowing succession involving the Indian coral tree or other species might lead to habitat modification that might counter management of the atoll as a seabird-nesting colony! Outcomes of Dan and Ed's experiments have been endlessly applicable in my work. I had to consider their conclusions when selecting plant species to repopulate a disturbed site, where initial species composition would need to already be in dynamic equilibrium to best contend with short- and long-term disturbance and allow desired short- and long-term succession. Repeated introductions of non-native natural enemies for pest control could be defined as the immigrants that Dan and Ed described; would they replace desirable native species through turnover? And this may seem obscure, but considering what is needed for survival of the critically endangered Hawaiian crow ‘Alala based on environmental conditions produced by turnover and that do not represent conditions where they once thrived is absolutely necessary. Can we describe succession in reverse to learn what they need now? I value the perspective that these foundational papers have provided me in so many scenarios. Dan and Ed provided evidence of change and the value of understanding interactions that advanced how we think about systems. Instead of adjusting models to compensate for change, researchers and managers are challenged to recognize change as essential to patterns in nature, and they struggle when history, interactions, and change are not considered integral to the systems they describe and manage. Adapting ideas derived from static systems developed over long evolutionary time to also include change attributed to recent, ongoing, and future interactions—rapid evolution and succession—has now become commonplace in my work and fundamental to my philosophy. During my second semester of college, my Introductory Biology class was required to attend a public science lecture. Although we were repeatedly assured that this guy was a big deal, I was convinced that I had better things to do. After all, I was almost six months into trying to become a doctor—I was a very busy person. But I did as I was told and went to the fancy auditorium reserved for important people. I sat myself in the back row and listened politely to the long and impressive introduction. Once the auditorium was silent, the speaker accepted the microphone and the lecture began. Edward O. Wilson did not ramble, or use big words, or show complicated graphs. He told us a story. He described adventures on mangrove islands involving tents and bugs and boats. He showed photographs of comically large tents surrounding comically small islands, flanked by sweaty people laughing in the sunshine. He connected his narrative to a scientific theory with a big name, one that he spoke of with the enthusiasm of an 18th-century explorer on a particular exotic voyage. He ended with a picture of a smiling young man in waders who would go on to be my graduate advisor. Listening to Dr. Wilson describe his experiments with Dr. Simberloff (Simberloff and Wilson (1969) Ecology 50:278–296) was not the first time I had heard a scientist talk about his or her research. But in that talk, he turned biology into something real to me. I had always thought of science as something that occurs in a classroom or in a laboratory, something cold, and sterile, and serious by definition. But Dr. Wilson described an important scientific advancement in a way that most any 18-year-old could understand and get excited about. He made his experiments sound like an adventure, something done by regular people outside in real-world conditions. It was an empowering, pivotal moment in my life, although I didn't realize it until much later. This man did not wear a white coat, did not spend his days trapped a windowless laboratory, but he was a scientist. More than that—he was an ecologist, someone paid to study the subject that I had always loved. While it took me two more semesters to officially drop my “pre-med” label, that day I decided that I wanted to be an ecologist too. I was a graduate student without a project when I first came across the papers by Dan and Ed. I was trying to find my way to meaningful research with the only compass I had—my interest in biogeography—and had taken some good advice, reading as much as I could of the primary literature. It may have been 2004, but I was steeped in classic papers from the 1950s and 60s, learning about how warblers coexist in a forest; what (if anything) Santa Rosalia has to do with species diversity; why mountain passes are higher in the tropics; and how islands are colonized following defaunation. The series of papers on defaunation by Dan and Ed stood out. To test a novel theory, the authors executed one of the largest field manipulations ever, fumigating entire mangrove islands! Beyond the strong test of theory and the slick methods, I discovered the papers had valuable nuggets of wisdom for a young field ecologist. The first is to start with a question that excites you. If you're at all curious, this should be easy enough. However, as Dan and Ed show, the question will likely be with you for many years, so make sure it's a question you want to explore for the foreseeable future. Second, let the question guide you to the best study system. Did Dan and Ed have an overwhelming desire to work on mangrove islands in Florida, knee-deep in salt water with a side of sunburn? Perhaps not, but the question dictated the system. As they wrote, what was needed was “a method either of producing new islands … or of sterilizing preexisting islands.” The mangrove islands of southern Florida proved to be the perfect place. Third, dream big. The scale and magnitude of their manipulation still astonish me. Dan and Ed showed that yes, you can put a tent over an entire island and fumigate it to remove all the critters. You just have to dream big about experimental possibilities! Fourth, a field ecologist has to have grit. Ecology is messy. Experiments are complicated. One rarely gets through a field season without muttering a few choice words. Indeed, the authors describe in great detail the experiments that failed and the complications they faced. But with fortitude, the authors prevailed. Finally, ecologists need to appreciate the natural history of their study species. Ecology has gotten away from descriptive science and moved toward experimental work. However, Dan and Ed beautifully meld the two and show how natural history can inform our understanding of results. I would argue that the morsels of natural history make the series an ever more enjoyable read. Strangely, Dan and Ed's classic test of island biogeography theory was not discussed in my undergraduate ecology classes at Berkeley, so I didn't dig into this work until the fall of 1980, when I arrived at Florida State University as a new graduate student. In talking with Dan, he told me that for their studies, Ed's connections to expert arthropod taxonomists were a huge help for all of the species identifications. Dan recalled that he lived on a diet of fresh lobster and key lime pie while doing all of the field work. He also told me about watching beetles and spiders foraging among sponge and coral colonies growing on the upper fringes of the mangrove prop roots. I really wanted to conduct my dissertation research on this system, but, unfortunately, we didn't have the funding. However, those assemblages of terrestrial arthropods and marine invertebrates have lived on in my dreams and imagination, occasionally revived by an episode of the TV series “Bloodline.” Dan and Ed's paper remains as relevant today as it did almost five decades ago, and not just because it provides a textbook example of a critical field experiment that tested key predictions of an important ecological theory. In the ecology of today, the emphasis is on reproducible science and data sharing, but Dan and Ed were already doing that in 1969. They published in Ecology their complete colonization and extinction data, which have been re-analyzed by many subsequent authors, but most famously by Dan himself, who critically re-assessed turnover and residency status in his important 1976 Science paper. The turnover quantified in Dan and Ed's study is also relevant to the increase in beta diversity and shifts in species composition that ecologists are now quantifying during these times of unprecedented environmental change. It was later in my graduate training that I became familiar with Dan and Ed's experiments. I had been immersed in the metacommunity and spatial ecology literature, so coming across Dan and Ed's work without any a priori knowledge of their reputation gave me a fresh take in the discovery process. This allowed me to see for myself why the experiments are now such classics in our discipline. As a postdoc, I had the chance to attend to a symposium celebrating the 40th anniversary of the “Island Biogeography Theory,” where Ed, Dan, and many others, famous and new to the discipline, were presenting their work along with a historical perspective. This was a very inspiring moment for me, as I now heard first-hand the impressive science that I had so recently read about and saw these significant ecologists in person. I was inspired to incorporate their theory within my work on trophic interactions, without sacrificing its elegance. This began my quest to test the network of trophic interactions over the different islands following Dan and Ed's work. As I think back to what struck me about Dan and Ed's work, the words elegance, creativity, and audacity come to my mind: first, elegance because the experiment so nicely tested a theory, exactly the way it was formulated, yet from many different angles, and second, creativity because the experiments required imagination to defaunate entire islands, monitor re-colonization dynamics, and track community turnover. Dan and Ed made it a reality, albeit with much resistance, which causes me to think about not only their creativity, but audacity. They actually had the courage to undertake and complete such a massive effort. Their studies shaped my view that communities are constantly changing, that there is no single and stable attractor, and that an equilibrium can be dynamic. Further, subsequent analyses showed that colonization from a regional species pool and extinction processes are key elements in understanding local community dynamics. Obviously, the study is not replicable anymore and I could not imagine obtaining the legal permits to perform such a study on the Florida Keys today. However, Dan and Ed were ahead of their time in publishing an entire dataset that allows anyone with modern analytical methods to continually revisit their conclusions. Today, I teach the story not only for its own scientific merit, but also to show students that fundamental contributions in science do not have to stand on sophisticated and elaborated techniques, but rather on innovation, simplicity, and a good theory. When I first heard about fumigating whole islands and counting all the insect species on these islands in my undergraduate Ecology class, it struck me as an insanely ambitious undertaking, Now, as a professor who uses empirical experimentation and advises students on their own experiments, I think back to Dan and Ed's work as setting a standard. Beyond the substantial insights gained into species–area relationships and island biogeography, Dan and Ed's work provided a model in addressing theory-based questions with field experimentation on a massive, ecologically meaningful, scale, in a hypothesis testing framework, and with deep natural history. It is this combination of study attributes I try to emulate in my own work, encourage in the work of my students, and deeply appreciate in the research of others. Dan and Ed's work also influenced me through their meticulous identification of all the insects on the islands, thus providing a means to “de-anonymize” the species–area relationship. This hard natural historical work allowed re-surveys of the islands to understand species turnover, a key prediction of island biogeography—which species had changed after ten years? Is colonization random? Natural history for me is such an important part of studying both ecology and evolution, and, though more time-consuming than other types of data collections, is essential to challenging our understanding of how nature works. Back when I was working on my dissertation at Cedar Creek in Minnesota, far from Florida State University and from Dan, my advisor, I recall one conversation in which I was trying to explain to Dan how I thought early-feeding chrysomelid beetles were influencing the abundance and use of sumac stems by later-emerging stem boring beetles at my field site. Upon hearing my ideas, Dan delivered what I later realized was the ultimate insult, though I didn't appreciate it at the time—he called my ideas “anecdotal.” He pushed me to figure out how to show these connections experimentally, which, incidentally, also included small-scale scaffolding and insect netting.

",,,,"Online data resources are becoming increasingly important for ecologists. However, compared with fields such as molecular biology and physical environmental science, there are few resources containing raw ecological data that can be used for further research. Reasons for this include the greater heterogeneity of most ecological data compared with, say, nucleic acid sequences, or remote-sensing data, and the fact that many data are collected by individual research laboratories rather than by a community effort. Examples of web-based ecological data resources are the Long-term Ecological Research (LTER) catalogue of the data collected across the US network of environmental monitoring sites (http://www.lternet.edu/), and the Global Population Dynamics Database (GPDD) (NERC Centre for Population Biology at Imperial College, 1999) which makes available 5000 time-series of species population densities, each over 10 years duration. The Ecological Society of America established the Ecological Archives (Peet 1998) as a depositary for electronic information. Fields that overlap with ecology are perhaps richer in web-based data resources: Treebase (http://www.treebase.org/treebase/) is a database of phylogenies, while an increasing number of taxonomic catalogues are now web-based. Much biodiversity information including distributional and ecological data are being collected digitally, or are being digitized, and the goal of the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) is to provide a seamless portal for access to this distributed resource.

The purpose of this article is to describe a web-based resource for the UK's long-term individual-based time-series (LITS) data. In the next section we explain what we mean by LITS data, introduce the LITS project, and then describe the web resource. In the concluding part we discuss several issues the project raises that may influence future moves to make more ecological information available on the web.","0021-8790

I am glad to see Graham's latest book focusing on land bridges. A land bridge is a physical connection of two otherwise separate landmasses. As stated in the Preface, biogeographically, land bridges have played important roles in shaping the patterns of the diversity and evolution of organisms. These roles include three aspects: (i) when land bridges existed, they allowed animals and plants to cross and colonize new lands, permanently changing the ecosystems into which they immigrate; (ii) after previously existing land bridges disappeared or fragmented, they separated organisms that were previously distributed continuously, causing reproductive isolation and promoting speciation; and (iii) land bridges alter moisture and heat transport at a global scale, impacting on the development of patterns of the diversity and evolution of organisms across geographically remote regions. In the Introduction, Graham reviews the history of the development and the biological consequences of land bridges. He argues that all relevant geological events and processes acting on organisms and communities of organisms collectively determine their movement, diversification and geographical affinities. He states that additional attention must be paid to plants as the conspicuous, conveniently stationary components of the Earth's ecosystems. The main body of the book is divided into three parts. The first part addresses Boreal Land Bridges: the Bering Land Bridge (BLB: West Beringia and East Beringia) and the North Atlantic Land Bridge (NALB). Graham states that from the Pliocene the BLB permitted episodic migrations of organisms between the biotas of boreal lands. In contrast, the NALB extended more or less continuously from Europe to North America until c. 59 Ma, when promulgation of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge reached the North Atlantic, partially disrupting movement of a wide array of organisms––and, thus, ecosystems––into and out of the New World over a long interval of time. The second part of the book is about the Equatorial Land Bridges: the Antillean Land Bridge (ALB) and the Central American Land Bridge (CALB). Graham defines the ALB as a series of discontinuous island stepping stones throughout the Tertiary characterized by having islands close together and land in the Greater and Lesser Antilles present since the latest Eocene and some islands in the Greater Antilles connected at various times. However, he views the CALB as a causeway for organisms migrating between North America and Central America as far south as eastern Panama, disjunctly into South America in the Late Cretaceous and throughout most of the Tertiary, then continuously with establishment of the Central American Land Bridge principally after c. 3.5 Ma (‘The Great American Biotic Interchange’). The third part of the book focuses on the Austral Land Bridge (the Magellan Land Bridge) between the Cono Sur and Antarctica. This land bridge served as a biotic gateway for dispersal across Gondwana throughout the Cretaceous and early Cenozoic. The dispersal was characterized by occurring mostly from west to east and south to north. The aim of the book as expressed in the Preface is “to trace the formation and disruption of New World land bridges and describe the biotic, climatic, and biogeographic consequences.” I found all these goals to have been achieved successfully in the book, as highlighted in the book's endorsements by Paul Manos (Duke University) and Henry Hooghiemstra (University of Amsterdam): it is “a synthesis of vast amounts of information to produce a paleo-perspective on plant diversity through the last hundred million years in a clear and timely, highly original work with great potential to contribute to the biogeographical history of the Americas; a fascinating story made out of such a large bulk of evidence; an impressive, integrated picture of Earth history. In other words, a unique and readable statement of an immensely complex subject.” Another value of the book for specialists is the considerable amount of supplementary, baseline data compiled in tables and appendices presented online at http://press.uchicago.edu/sites/graham. These include representative plants utilizing each of the land bridges through the different periods of geological time. The value of the book is further enhanced for those in related disciplines, students and general readers by the extensive bibliography of approximately 1400 references, and the inclusion under Additional References of related presentations in the public print and visual media. Widely used common/popular names for extant plants are provided in the book's online material. With the advent of molecular data, and particularly the use of molecular clocks when warranted, biogeographers have provided more and more evidence for the roles of land bridges played in global biogeography and ecosystems (Davis et al., 2002; Le Péchon et al., 2016; for reviews, see Givnish and Renner, 2004; Xiang et al., 2015; Wen et al., 2016). As noted in the book, “land bridges are important but they are not the only means of migration, and various plant and animals have other options. These include distributions that are residuals of ancient continental positions, crossings over the land by birds and/or wind, drift through or around the bridges by ocean currents, migration on land by means other than human transport (extant or extinct), more recent distributions by humans and the animals they followed, and combinations of all these.”

",,,,,,"To elucidate the molecular phylogeny of Neottia japonica, which is a terrestrial orchid distributed in East Asia, the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) of nuclear DNA and the matK of chloroplast DNA were used. A total 22 species of 69 accessions for ITS and 21 species of 114 accessions for matK phylogeny were analyzed with the maximum parsimony and Bayesian methods. In addition, we sought to establish a correlation between the distribution, morphology of the auricles and genetic association of N. japonica with phylogenetic data. The phylogenetic results suggest that N. japonica is monophyletic and a sister to N. suzukii in terms of the ITS phylogeny, while it is paraphyletic with N. suzukii in terms of the matK phylogeny. N. japonica and N. suzukii show similar morphologies of the lip and column, they both flower in April, and they are both distributed sympatrically in Taiwan. Therefore, it appears to be clear that N. japonica and N. suzukii are close taxa within Neottia, although there is incongruence between the nrDNA and cpDNA phylogenies of N. japonica. The incongruence between the two datasets may have various causes, meaning that further studies are needed to confirm the evolutionary process of N. japonica. The phylogenetic status of N. kiusiana, which was not included in previous studies, was as a sister to N. nidus-avis. Meanwhile, the ITS and matK phylogenies are unsuitable for identifying genetic associations with the characteristic of auricles. The phylogenetic topologies of Korean, Taiwanese and mainland Chinese individuals suggest that the populations of N. japonica in Korea originated from Chinaâs mainland and island areas. The characterization of regional gene differences could provide useful preliminary data for future studies. Keywords: Neottia, Neottia japonica, Phylogeny, ITS, matK, East Asia

They are common and publicly consumed freshwater or semi-terrestrial crabs inhabiting vicinities near the waterfalls of Lake Sebu Municipality, South Cotabato in Mindanao, but both species are scarcely investigated. This study aimed to examine the body size, microhabitat and the feeding ecology of these freshwater crab species. Sex and carapace width and length of individuals were determined from specimens collected by hand at three waterfall sampling sites. Feeding and feeding niche overlap were respectively analyzed using the index of relative importance (IRI) of prey items from individual crab stomachs and the Schoener's R o index. Food items ingested include fish fragments, insect body parts, fragments of aquatic vascular plants, freshwater algae, sand grains and amorphous materials, and these items were similar between species. However, the larger I. mindanaoense appeared to ingest more fish fragments and other animal prey items compared to S. miguelito which ingested more amorphous materials that are derived from benthic plants. However, the R o value of 93% was high, suggesting very similar diet. The two species further partition niches, with S. miguelito being smaller in size and inhabiting sand and gravel substrate, while the larger I. mindanaoense inhabit areas with big boulders. Hence, the crabs can be categorized as omnivorous and detrivorous, and exhibit feeding and habitat niche partitioning that alleviate possible resource competition between the two species.","0115-7809

",,,,"In our zealous desire for familiar models of explanation, we risk not noticing the discrepancies between our own predispositions and the range of possibilities inherent in natural phenomena. In short, we risk imposing on nature the very stories we like to hear. Evelyn Fox Keller, 1985 Reflections on Gender and Science The narratives and metaphors that ecologists use to describe natural phenomena influence what we study and how we do it (Larson 2011, Craver and Darden 2013, Otto and Rosales 2020). Stories about ecological processes and patterns are told through particular frames and are laden with assumptions arising from their framing. For example, the tubercle bacillus became the cause of tuberculosis, rather than unregulated industrial capitalism, through storytelling: the framing of the story was biomedical, and as a result the assumption for how to treat tuberculosis was through individual medical intervention, rather than (for example) a social revolution (Levins and Lewontin 1985). More recently, a commonly cited solution to rising CO2 emissions is to plant trees, which conveniently elides the social and economic roots of global warming. The responsible use of particular frames, narratives, and analogies for understanding nature requires that we reflect on our choices: Which stories do we tell? How do we tell them? And how do they structure the way we study the natural world? To make room for this kind of reflection, we organized and participated in an Inspire session entitled ""When the window is a mirror: how do dominant theories limit our understanding of nature?"" at the ESA 2023 meeting. This session was an attempt to explore the limitations of current theory and their consequences for understanding what we observe in the natural world. In a set of case studies, we examined existing ""mirrors"": examples in which ecological models are built on assumptions that constrain the research process, and in doing so reveal something about ourselves and the narratives we privilege. Our speakers described the limits of theory on topics ranging from sexual behavior to plant–microbe interactions to genetic polymorphism. This allowed us to look for uniting themes across subdisciplines of ecology. In bringing these subdisciplines together, we attempted to highlight such limitations not as isolated exceptions, but rather as recurring consequences of singular, dominant ways of approaching ecological questions. Our session emphasized the importance of creativity and wonderment in scientific research and the power of pluralistic approaches for confronting theoretical limitations brought on by societal assumptions. Same-sex sexual behavior (SSB) is widespread throughout the animal kingdom. For years, Western scientists ignored, downplayed, or discounted this behavior as a costly aberration. More recent work, including our own, has recognized that SSB is not only common but may have a long evolutionary history and need not incur fitness costs (Monk et al. 2019, Lerch and Servedio 2021, Richardson and Zuk 2023). As recognition of the scope of SSB among animals has grown in both scientific understanding and popular culture, many have questioned what these insights mean for our understanding of human sexuality; does the fact that animals engage in SSB make it ""natural""? Demonstrating the diversity of sexual systems and sexual behaviors found in nature is undoubtedly vital for increasing feelings of belonging among queer students and researchers in the sciences (Casper et al. 2022). However, our reframing of the study of SSB in animals shows us how what we understand to be ""natural"" in the first place is inevitably shaped by the cultures, norms, and values that scientists ourselves hold. We argue that there is great danger in positioning what is deemed ""objectively natural"" as the arbiter of what is culturally normative, moral, or appropriate. Instead, as scientists we should aim to interrogate and articulate our values and politics, and think critically about how they inform our decisions; what questions we ask, hypotheses we make, methods we use, results and voices we uplift, and interpretations we favor. It is important to study and share the extraordinary sexual diversity found among nonhuman species, and indeed to combat narratives that aim to simplify the public's understanding of biological sex and sexual behavior. However, we should be clear that queer and trans identities are valid no matter the science on animal behavior and sexual evolution, and that acceptance of human diversity should not be predicated on our constantly shifting understanding of the ""natural"" world. The temporal order and interval of community assembly can often affect how species interact. Generally defined as ""priority effect,"" this phenomenon interested both empiricists and theoreticians (Fukami 2015). However, our theories are often limited in their ability to characterize priority effects in nature because they do not incorporate two principles about time. First, ecological communities operate on a range of time scales. Priority effects influence communities of organisms ranging from bacteria and yeast to plant and amphibian communities. The vast differences in life history among these communities may imply distinctive underlying biological mechanisms for priority effects in each community. Second, all ecological processes take time; therefore, changes in species interactions should depend on the length of the difference in arrival times, which can determine their relative sizes or the degree of habitat modification (Rudolf 2019). These features are not well incorporated into theoretical explanations of priority effects, which are often based on positive frequency dependence: if both species limit the other more than themselves, the more abundant species wins (Ke and Letten 2018). This conception is detached from the two principles about time because the early species is not necessarily more abundant in communities with slow-reproducing species, and this theory does not allow for temporal changes in species interactions. To bridge theory and experiments of priority effects, we define those arising from positive frequency dependence as ""frequency-dependent"" priority effects, and those arising from temporal changes in species interactions as ""trait-dependent"" priority effects, because they are usually caused by changes in traits over arrival times, such as size, age, or behavior (Zou and Rudolf 2023). This categorization accommodates diverse biological mechanisms in nature, including interactions beyond competition that change with time. Models of priority effects should be designed with the two principles about time in mind to capture different ecosystems more accurately. Plant communities are shaped by their bidirectional interactions with beneficial and detrimental soil microbes (van der Putten et al. 2013). To predict the long-term consequences of plant–soil microbe interactions, ecologists often employ a two-phased experiment inspired by the theory of plant–soil feedback (Bever et al. 1997). The classic experimental design consists of a conditioning phase, during which plants modify the soil community, and a subsequent response phase, during which plants respond to the modification. However, like theoretical models, experiments are also an abstraction of nature. Specifically, by immediately transplanting the responding seedling after soil conditioning, experiments implicitly assume that new plants immediately arrive or that the conditioned microbial legacies are long-lasting after the death of the host plant. Nevertheless, recent research has shown that this assumption may not hold in various systems, such as those characterized by distinct seasonality or frequent disturbance (Nagendra and Peterson 2016, Esch and Kobe 2021). Neglecting the temporal decay of microbial legacies in these systems can lead to incorrect predictions of plant competitive outcomes or an overestimation of microbial impact (Ke et al. 2021). Therefore, while the common two-phased design aims for generality, it is crucial to consider the natural history of different systems when extrapolating experimental results to a natural context (Travis 2020). Plants have the capacity to change the climate around them (Lembrechts 2023, Novick and Barnes 2023). In particular, plants open their stomata to photosynthesize and consequently move water out of the soil and into the air around their leaves. This cools and humidifies microclimates and macroclimates. Grasses can do this at small scales (Wright et al. 2021), while tropical forest trees can drive climatic changes at the scale of entire regions (Wright et al. 2017). Initial attempts to quantify the effect of vegetation on climate have focused on understory temperatures (e.g. Lembrechts 2023), which are locally correlated with relative humidity and vapor pressure deficit. These attempts have shown that every type of vegetation on earth can either cool or warm the microclimate (warming is most common in cold biomes where vegetation can insulate and create areas of warmer air). These changes in microclimate conditions affect performance of plants (Aguirre et al. 2021), plant trait expression (Watson et al. 2023), plant–plant interaction strengths (Wright et al. 2014), and productivity (Aguirre et al. 2021). Because vegetation-induced temperature, humidity, and vapor pressure deficit changes are ubiquitous and inevitable, I think it is important to reimagine a world where all other types of interactions (including competition) are nested within these constructed microclimates. Plants compete for resources, and in a purely competitive world diversity is maintained by intraspecific competition: a plant species must compete with itself more strongly than with other species to ensure coexistence. Intraspecific competition has become so central to our understanding of plant diversity that it is standard procedure to set all plant interactions as competitive when simulating plant communities or parameterizing population and species distribution models. While we know that plants are also capable of intraspecific facilitation, these beneficial interactions are rarely accounted for in frameworks of diversity maintenance, and certainly not in predictions of coexistence. In this talk, I present extensive evidence of intraspecific facilitation in a diverse, natural plant system when relaxing the above restrictions on models and parameterizations. We found that intraspecific facilitation varied idiosyncratically across species and environmental conditions, indicating it is not simply an isolated exception, but rather a pervasive force shaping community diversity. Current theoretical frameworks do not allow coexistence when intraspecific facilitation is operating, despite empirical evidence to the contrary. Competitive theories of diversity maintenance can therefore describe certain conditions under which coexistence should arise but clearly do not capture the full spectrum of conditions under which coexistence can arise. Current theory is thus neither exhaustive nor should it be limiting. Creating novel theory which better reflects what we observe in nature requires us to be inspired by the unexpected rather than blinded to it. Dominant theories of population ecology limit our understanding of the population ecology of mutualism. For nearly a half century we have seen marginalization of the theoretical study of mutualism through explicit dismissal (""… unlike trophic interactions, mutualisms do not seem to be of universal importance,"" Turchin (2013)) and self-admonishing ""laziness"" (May 1981). But this systemic underrepresentation of mutualism relative to other interspecific interactions like competition and predation is most clearly observed through quantitative analysis of books Simha et al. (2022) and primary literature (Bronstein 1994, Raerinne 2020). Recently, however, mutualism has been viewed and modeled as a consumer–resource interaction (e.g., Holland et al. 2005), which has been incredibly important and useful theoretically (e.g., De Mazancourt and Schwartz 2010, Holland and DeAngelis 2010) and empirically (e.g., Lim et al. 2018). Although framing mutualism as a consumer–resource interaction helps it fit within the dominant theoretical framework, and provides some mathematical conveniences (i.e., to ""put a curve on it"" in order to prevent unbounded growth, and because a Type I functional response can be recovered by a Type II response by setting a parameter to 0), I wanted to draw attention to the idea that not all mutualisms can or should be described by this framework. Conceptually there are some issues for the most common and ecologically important mutualisms like pollination, seed dispersal, and defense where half of the entire interaction is not a consumer–resource interaction. For example, Revilla (2015) asked, ""… what is the handling time of a plant that uses a pollinator or seed disperser? Or at which rate does a plant attack a service?"" I also presented unpublished data showing that the Holling type II numerical and functional responses do not seem to be common across empirical studies of mutualism: most seem to be unimodal. Mutualistic interactions are wonderfully diverse and essential parts of communities and ecosystems. Although many mutualisms fit within the dominant consumer–resource theory, I ask that we continue to better understand mutualisms by not assuming they are fully explained as a consumer–resource interaction and embracing and marveling in their diversity and complexity. The distributions of parent materials, topography, and latitude, as well as disturbance history and the presence of nearby islands, are important drivers of island biodiversity dynamics (Brandeis et al. 2009, Carstensen et al. 2012, Whittaker et al. 2017). These conditions have also been influential in the process of European colonization of Caribbean islands due to their influence on island suitability for colonial extraction (Parsons 1975, Watts 1990, Mahony and Endfield 2018). Suitability for plantation colonialism may include potential landscape productivity (e.g. latitude, mean annual temperature, mean annual precipitation, and altitude), resources to support long-term intensive monocropping (e.g., groundwater availability), and sufficient resources to manage large enslaved populations (Ross 2017). The biogeographical determinants of European plantation colonization and consequences for island biogeography following sustained plantation disturbances remain largely unaddressed in terrestrial ecology. Through a field study on the former Danish colony of St. Croix (U.S. Virgin Islands), my colleagues and I aim to test whether the aforementioned state factors predict the intensity of colonial ecosystem disturbance (proxied by duration of colonization, cultivated area, primary crops, and cumulative enslaved populations from Danish archival records). Our work uses interdisciplinary methods to describe how the relationship between state factors and degree of colonization may be predictive of the reassembly of forest vegetation communities following the abandonment of sugarcane plantation fields. We hypothesize that post-plantation soil environments are physically disturbed and nutrient-limited due to long-term agricultural degradation. On post-plantation islands like St. Croix, the relative abundance taxa with functional traits that can alleviate resource limitations (e.g., leguminous, C4 photosynthetic, and arbuscular mycorrhizal taxa (Dovrat et al. 2020)) may vary along axes of former plantation intensity and state factors which are known to present the greatest utility for colonial exploitation (i.e., greatest contiguous area of alluvial soils, highest annual precipitation, dominant calcareous parent material, etc.). As we scale our field-based, island-specific work up to larger spatial scales, we ultimately aim to interrogate ahistorical notions of the biogeographic drivers of twentieth-century and present-day forest vegetation community structure and function within the footprint of European plantation colonialism. In Simha et al. (2022), we describe a ""diversity paradox"" in community ecology: multispecies communities are ubiquitous in nature, although many classical approaches to ecological modeling suggest that species ""should"" not coexist except under special conditions. I argue that a parallel framework exists in evolutionary biology and population genetics, framing the persistence of polymorphism despite the action of natural selection as a surprising occurrence that warrants special explanation. While classical theory expects commonly studied forms of natural selection like directional and stabilizing selection to reduce genetic variation over time (Falconer 1996), many biological processes can complicate these predictions. For example, pleiotropy, plasticity, epistasis, and demographic compensation can all complicate the mapping of genetic variation onto fitness. Similarly, geographic variation in drivers of natural selection and interactions between multiple drivers can complicate inference about responses to selection made using static estimates of selection coefficients. Finally, balancing selection can also maintain rather than deplete natural variation (Hedrick 2006, Mitchell-Olds et al. 2007). Nevertheless, predictions concerning diversifying forms of natural selection are less commonly made, and tested, when framing research about genetic polymorphism. Our work illustrates how complicating phenomena influence the evolution of genetic and phenotypic variation across the landscape. Focusing on just one polymorphism in one study species, we found that the genes controlling variation in plant secondary chemistry have pleiotropic effects on drought tolerance and anti-herbivore defense. We also found that there is plasticity in the mapping of variation in chemical biosynthesis genes onto fitness, that the magnitude and direction of selection exerted by herbivory and drought vary across fitness components, and that the net effects of these selective drivers are interactive, varying in complex ways at small spatial scales (Carley and Morris, unpublished data). Ultimately, secondary metabolites experience balancing selection that maintains variation; there is no single optimum genotype or phenotype that is consistently favored (Carley and Mitchell-Olds 2021). This work demonstrates that real-world conditions driving selection and adaptation may frequently violate simple model assumptions, and that explicit study of ""complicating factors"" may often be necessary for understanding intraspecific genetic and phenotypic variation. What we think models capture or portray, an image of what is outside (window) vs some version of ourselves (mirror), is an important aspect of the future of modeling in ecology. During the panel discussion, one question was about the role of mathematical modeling in theory as computational power becomes less limiting. As computational limitations that necessitated simpler mathematical models are dissolved, do general models become obsolete? The example the audience member provided was individual-based models (IBMs), which model individuals to understand the dynamics of populations, as opposed to modeling populations themselves. The implication of this question was that an increasing ability to compute population changes at finer-and-finer resolution is the main goal of modeling, but it's worth asking if this is truly the case. One speaker raised this issue by bringing up the short story ""On Exactitude in Science,"" which warns against the limitations of higher and higher model precision while highlighting the importance of generality in models for making sense of the world around us (Kandlikar). On the other hand, all of the speakers demonstrated how overly general theory has led us astray in making sense of the world around us by collapsing or ignoring important axes of variation. The easy take-home message from our session would be that perhaps we should sacrifice model generality in favor of precision and realism (Levins 1966). What we propose instead aligns more closely with Levins (1966)'s call for understanding nature through a multiplicity of approaches (see also Odenbaugh 2005). By ""embracing and marveling in … diversity and complexity"" (Moore), perhaps we can reframe modeling not as an effort to capture singular, generalizable truths about the natural world, nor to precisely recapitulate the complexity of nature. Instead, we might take advantage of and accept that ""all models are wrong"" in that each captures both an image of what is outside and some version of ourselves. If all models are simultaneously windows and mirrors, we can become interested in what model diversity reveals about nature (and our relation to it) rather than the pursuit of the grails of generality, precision, and realism. Another theme that emerged was a discussion about how we can better incorporate the ideas from this session into the way we teach ecology. Do we simply stop teaching ideas and models that have so deeply shaped the discipline, but that seem to reflect assumptions informed by social biases more than nature? Or, if we are not to simply abandon such ideas in the classroom, how can we better convey the sense of uncertainty and contemplation conveyed by the talks in this session? Given the outsized roles that dominant ideas (by definition) play in the historical and contemporary structure of the field, excluding them outright seems unsatisfactory. A more fruitful path forward will be to make space for discussions about the social–historical origins of ideas, their impacts on the field, and their limitations. For example, to help students better understand the history of ideas shaping community ecology, one of the speakers (Wright) introduces students to the terrestrial and theoretical ecology academic family trees (https://academictree.org) to highlight their origins. This helps foster conversations about the cultural forces that determine the path of ""foundational"" papers, and the privilege that some authors enjoy in their efforts to disseminate their ideas. More generally, incorporating lessons from the history and philosophy of ecology, and from fields like Science & Technology Studies, in traditional ""ecology"" classrooms will help train ecologists to assess how ""mirrors"" and ""windows"" interact to shape our understanding of, and relationship with, nature. Teaching a wider range of ideas than are emphasized in most ecology texts is also essential. Several speakers highlighted the often-overlooked role of positive interactions within and between species (Wright, Bimler, Moore); more thoroughly introducing students to the diversity and importance of these interactions may ultimately help the field incorporate such interactions into our understanding of ecological communities. The last speaker (Kandlikar) advocated for more fearless experimentation in the classroom. Students' introduction to ecology in the classroom shapes the way they will approach ecological ideas throughout their lives. Embracing uncertainty and intentionally breaking dubious conventions, and sharing with students the rationale for doing so, will be an important step in developing future generations of scientists and thinkers. A unifying takeaway from our session was the importance of historicizing and interrogating assumptions and the narratives that go along with them. For example, the assumption that same-sex sexual behavior in animals incurs a fitness cost and should therefore be rare (discussed by Monk) may stem from Western, Victorian-era values of sexuality. Similarly, early modern sexual values have ""haunted"" plant biology since Linnaeus (Subramaniam and Bartlett 2023). Even in the current day, narratives of Asian plants' invasion in the United States mirror anti-Asian xenophobia, even when such characterizations belie ecological reality (Cardozo and Subramaniam 2013). We believe that putting assumptions into their historical contexts (for example by using methods suggested by Wright, Taylor (2010)) can empower ecologists to spot potential cases of ""double transference"" such as these, when social values are transposed onto nature, deemed natural, and then used to justify existing social orders (Foster et al. 2011). Drawing from allied disciplines and subdisciplines such as Black ecologies (Hare 1970, Hosbey et al. 2022), queer ecology (Mortimer-Sandilands and Erickson 2010), and Indigenous ecology (Reo and Ogden 2018, Hart-Fredeluces et al. 2021), in addition to cross-disciplinary work with art, history, and philosophy, can inspire new frames and conceptualizations through which to understand nature. Whether simplifying assumptions are maintained by colonial ideologies, historical convention, or sheer convenience, leaving our assumptions unexamined limits our understanding of nature in its expansive possibilities. We believe that ecological inquiry will be strengthened by explicit consideration of our simplifying assumptions, and their roots and consequences, as ecological theory unfolds. No data were collected for this study.

breed in North America but spend the winter in The Bahamas) through 115 point counts
conducted during December and January 2007–2012 on Abaco, The Bahamas. We also
analyzed structure and composition of the woody vegetation in Abaco’s two widespread
terrestrial habitats: Pineland, an open woodland of Pinus caribaea var. bahamensis (Bahamas Pine) that covers most of the island; and Coppice, a broadleaf, relatively diverse
forest that covers <10% of Abaco. Winter resident birds were more abundant in Pineland
(8.61 individuals/point) than in Coppice (2.28 individuals/point). Setophaga palmarum
(Palm Warbler) and S. coronata (Yellow-rumped Warbler) dominated the winter bird
communities in Pineland (44.6% and 37.4% of all detected individuals, respectively),
with the next three most common species (S. discolor [Prairie Warbler], Dumetella carolinensis [Gray Catbird], and Geothlypis trichas [Common Yellowthroat]) ranging from
6.5 to 2.0%. The winter species composition in Coppice was more even than in Pineland,

Seiurus aurocapillus [Ovenbird], S. caerulescens [Black-throated Blue Warbler], Mniotilta varia [Black-and-white Warbler], and S. citrina [Hooded Warbler]) ranging from
7.3 to 3.1%. In Pineland, bird community composition varied with overstory cover and
height, understory cover and type, and ground cover. In contrast, patterns of bird community composition in Coppice were not associated strongly with variation in habitat
structure or forest composition. This may reflect that Coppice, experiencing frequent
hurricane disturbance, has considerable small-scale heterogeneity in the availability of
food for winter resident birds. Comparing our data with those from previous surveys
of winter birds conducted 5–40 years earlier in the northern Bahamas, we see little evidence of major changes in this bird community.",,,,,,,,,,,,No,,,,"struct, com, pop",,rep,0.9947113513946533,1,0.002824457607731838,1.0,5,474.0

",,"Frontiers Media
",,,,"As a fundamental element of global carbon storage, the storage carbon in terrestrial ecosystem is significant for climate change mitigation. Land use/cover change (LUCC) is a main impact element of ecosystems’ carbon storage. Evaluating the relation between land use change and carbon storage is vital for lowering global carbon emissions. Taking Hainan Island as an example, this paper employs the InVEST as well as the CA-Markov models to assess and predict how different land use affects carbon storage in various situations from 2000 to 2020 and from 2030 to 2050 on Hainan Island. The influence factors, together with driving mechanisms of carbon storage spatial distribution are quantitatively analyzed as well in this paper. The results demonstrate that, from 2000 to 2020, Hainan Island’s net increase in built land was 605.49 km 2 , representing a growth rate of 77.05%. Over the last 20 years, Hainan Island’s carbon storage and density have decreased by 5.90 Tg and 1.75 Mg/hm 2 , respectively. The sharp rise in built land mainly makes the carbon storage decline. From 2030 to 2050, land use changes on Hainan Island are expected to result in differing degrees of carbon storage loss in various scenarios. In 2050, Hainan Island’s carbon storage will decline by 17.36 Tg in the Natural Development Scenario (NDS), 13.61 Tg in the Farmland Protection Scenario (FPS), and 8.06 Tg in the Ecological Protection Scenario (EPS) compared to 2020. The EPS can efficiently maintain carbon sequestration capability, but it cannot effectively prevent cropland area loss. Regarding the carbon storage’s spatial distribution, Hainan Island generally exhibits a pattern of high carbon storages in the low and middle carbon storages in the surrounding areas. Areas with high value are primarily located in Hainan Island’s central and southern mountainous areas, whereas areas with low value are primarily located in surrounding areas with lower elevations, primarily encompassing built land and cropland. Geographic detection presented the spatial differentiation of carbon storage in Hainan Island is mainly influenced by factors like slope, land use intensity, and DEM, as well as its interaction with other factors is significantly strengthened ( p &amp;lt; 0.05). Under the strategic framework of the “carbon peaking and carbon neutrality” goal and the national ecological civilization pilot zone, it is imperative to carefully consider scenarios for ecological protection and farmland protection, adopt ecological regulation models with spatial differentiation, and implement land use policies to improve ecosystem stability, which will contribute to carbon storage loss reduction and ensure food and ecological security.

This remarkable species is capable of walking and even jumping on dry land. We found that the Taklong Island population is fully nocturnal, and during night-time low tides the shrimp are found in small aggregations under logs well above the water line, while during night-time high tides they occur singly just above the water line or about a centimeter below the water surface. Observations of sexual characters indicate that M. oligodon is likely a protandric hermaphrodite, which has implications for the probable ancestral condition in caridean shrimps. Live color patterns appear to change ontogenetically and are not identical with other reported populations elsewhere in the Indo-West Pacific. The mangroves of Taklong Island were heavily impacted by the 2006 M/T Solar I oil spill, and the presence of M. oligodon in this mangrove forest is a sign of recovery from the effects of the bunker-oil spill.

This study uses economic valuation methods in the form of a choice experiment to elicit public preference for a wildfire management policy in Crete. The choice experiment was deployed around the island, with respondents asked about their preferences between different management strategies. The policies outlined in the survey are made up of the following attributes: ‘frequency of fires, ‘agricultural land burnt’, ‘landscape quality’, ‘protection against post-wildfire damage’ and ‘tax’ representing the payment vehicle. Results from a mixed logit model and latent class analysis indicate positive preference from the public for a new proposed policy.

Given the location and isolated nature of the CBAWO in the Canadian High Arctic, remote sensing data and derivatives have been instrumental for studies examining ecosystem structure and function at local and landscape scales. In combination with field measurements, remote sensing data facilitated mapping and modelling of vegetation types, % vegetation cover and aboveground phytomass, soil moisture, carbon exchange rates, and permafrost degradation and disturbance. It has been demonstrated that even in an environment with limited vegetation cover and phytomass, spectral vegetation indices (e.g., the normalized difference vegetation index) are able to model various biogeophysical variables. These applications are feasible for research sites such as the CBAWO using high spatial resolution remote sensing data across the visible, infrared, and microwave regions of the electromagnetic spectrum. Furthermore, as the satellite record continues to expand, we will gain a greater understanding of the impacts arising from the expected continued warming at northern latitudes. Although the logistics for research in the Arctic remain challenging, today's technologies (e.g., high spatial resolution satellite remote sensing, automated in situ sensors and data loggers, and wireless communication systems) can support a host of scientific endeavours in the Arctic (and other remote sites) through modelling and monitoring of biogeophysical variables and Earth surface processes with limited but critical field campaigns.

",,,,"Abstract Understanding the forces that shape population genetic structure is fundamental both for understanding evolutionary trajectories and for conservation. Many factors can influence the geographic distribution of genetic variation, and the extent to which local populations differ can be especially difficult to predict in highly mobile organisms. For example, many species of seabirds are essentially panmictic, but some show strong structure. Pigeon Guillemots ( Cepphus columba ; Charadriiformes: Alcidae) breed in small colonies scattered along the North Pacific coastline and feed in shallow nearshore waters year‐round. Given their distribution, gene flow is potentially lower and population genetic structure is stronger than in most other high‐latitude Northern Hemisphere seabirds. We screened variation in the mitochondrial control region, four microsatellite loci, and two nuclear introns in 202 Pigeon Guillemots representing three of five subspecies. Mitochondrial sequences and nuclear loci both showed significant population differences, although structure was weaker for the nuclear loci. Genetic differentiation was correlated with geographic distance between sampling locations for both the mitochondrial and nuclear loci. Mitochondrial gene trees and demographic modeling both provided strong evidence for two refugial populations during the Pleistocene glaciations: one in the Aleutian Islands and one farther east and south. We conclude that historical fragmentation combined with a stepping‐stone model of gene flow led to the relatively strong population differentiation in Pigeon Guillemots compared to other high‐latitude Northern Hemisphere seabird species. Our study adds to growing evidence that Pleistocene glaciation events affected population genetic structure not only in terrestrial species but also in coastal marine animals.

Understanding the dynamics of the global carbon cycle requires an accurate determination of the spatial and temporal distribution of photosynthetic CO2 uptake by terrestrial vegetation. Stress factors may cause sub-optimal photosynthetic function resulting in down-regulation (i.e., reduced rate of photosynthesis). Photosynthetic down-regulation is related to changes in the apparent spectral reflectance of leaves. Present approaches to determine ecosystem carbon exchange rely on meteorological data as inputs to models that predict the relative photosynthetic function in response to environmental conditions inducing stress (e.g., drought, high/low temperatures). This study examines the determination of ecosystem photosynthetic light use efficiency (LUE) from satellite observations, through measurement of vegetation spectral reflectance changes associated with physiologic stress responses. This approach is possible using the Moderate-Resolution Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on Terra to provide frequent, narrow-band measurements of high radiometric accuracy. Data from reflective MODIS ocean bands were used over land to calculate the Photochemical Reflectance Index (PRI), an index that is sensitive to reflectance changes near 531nm associated with vegetation stress responses exhibited by photosynthetic pigments. MODIS PRI values were compared with LUE calculated from values of CO2 flux measured at the overpass time at a flux tower located in a Douglas fir forest on Vancouver Island in Canada. Preliminary results show a relationship between MODIS PRI and LUE when using MODIS observations in the backscattering direction. These results compare well to previous work at a boreal aspen forest suggesting this approach may be generally useful.","0277-786X

",,,,"The importance of thoroughly monitoring the state of the environment in Mediterranean ecosystems has long been recognised. With regard to the spatial extension of large areas threatened by various degradation processes it becomes obvious that terrestrial observation alone is hardly able to cope with this task. Remote sensing with air‐ or spaceborne sensor systems provides a comprehensive spatial coverage, is intrinsically synoptic, and collects objective, repetitive data and is thus ideally suited for monitoring environmentally sensitive areas. The major problem associated with its use is to quantitatively interpret a measured signal that has interacted with remote objects in terms of the properties of these objects. In parallel to the advances in remote sensing geographical information systems (GIS) have emerged as a fully functional support for resource management tasks. As an example for tracing and analysing environmental change with coupled remote sensing and GIS approaches we present a case study on the island of Crete which was carried out in the framework of research programmes supported by the European Union. Although it is known that grazing in Crete dramatically increased during the last two decades, it was not well understood how grazing pressure differs spatially and in how far it altered the landscape of Crete. One of the major rangeland areas of central Crete, the Psiloritis Mountains, have been selected to serve as a test site for answering these questions. On the basis of an extended Landsat‐TM and ‐MSS data set acquired between 1977 and 1996 it has been shown that time series analysis techniques based on vegetation fractions derived from spectral unmixing can substantiate a spatio‐temporal interpretation of degradation processes. In areas under massive grazing pressure such processes can be linked to the respective driving forces by GIS‐based analyses of natural and socio‐economic boundary conditions.","1477-7835

",,,,"Primer of Ecological Restoration. Holl, K. D. 2020. Island Press, Washington, D.C. xvi + 202 pp. US$35.00 (paperback). ISBN 978-1-61091-972-2. Comparative Plant Succession among Terrestrial Biomes of the World. Prach, K., and L. R. Walker. 2020. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK. xii + 399 pp. £34.99 (paperback). ISBN 978-1-108-46024-8. More than 30 years ago, the eminent British plant ecologist A. D. Bradshaw remarked that “restoration [was] an acid test for ecology” (Bradshaw, 1987). Of course, the ecology he was referring to was that of community succession and consequently assembly. Two recent books, Primer of Ecological Restoration and Comparative Plant Succession among Terrestrial Biomes of the World, serve to illustrate progress made on that point today, though from opposite ends of the theory–practice spectrum. Karen Holl's little book is entitled Primer of Ecological Restoration, and it inducts the reader in a generally light, nonscientific way, equally accessible to practitioners of restoration, beginning students, and the general public. Accessibility is assisted by the short chapters, generally 10–12 pages each, within the attention span of even the least committed reader. A pair of introductory chapters outline humans’ motivations for restoration and define some terms. The restoration field is a terminological quagmire, to avoid which Holl supports a wider definition based on ecological integrity, sustainability, level of intervention, adaptive management, and social engagement. I prefer a simple definition of restoration, where restoration facilitates succession to a functional representation of the original ecosystem present on the site, though, as Holl points out, this is not always achievable and that it is probably not a useful definition in many anthropogenically modified parts of the world today, especially given the “shifting baselines” of Pauly (1995) and the plentiful alternate terminology for planting vegetation. Many useful hints about project management are covered in chapter 3, though the focus is on commercial-scale, funded projects, which are probably not the most common type of restoration projects. Actual methodology is not covered until chapter 9, and ecosourcing, which is increasingly being written into local and governmental legislation in New Zealand (e.g., Haines & Ferkins, 2007), is not even listed in the index. This reflects a more Americanized view of restoration than is perhaps practicable globally. Later chapters discuss more scientific aspects, such as adaptive management through monitoring and the role that poor ecological understanding plays in restoration failures, including consideration of disturbance regimes, a topic that dominates the thinking in Comparative Plant Succession among Terrestrial BIomes of the World. Scale, connectivity, and edges all receive mention, enlightening the general reader. Two chapters cover the main abiotic factors affecting restoration projects, especially landscape and soil and water issues. Of particular note is the tendency by restoration practitioners to perpetrate homogeneous plantings. These result in arrested successions, so much so that managers are retrospectively resorting to manual disturbances to create heterogeneity (e.g., Forbes et al., 2020). The problem of invasive species receives an entire chapter in the Primer, whereas a conclusion reached in Comparative Plant Succession is that invasive species are not a concern, especially in higher latitudes. This highlights a major dichotomy between restoration as facilitated succession versus natural plant succession, the causes of which are not immediately apparent, but they probably relate to the histories of anthropogenic disturbance. Indeed, this topic is one of the major motivations for Prach and Walker to write their book. Further, they define an unsuccessful succession as one where “[u]ndesirable weeds (ruderals) and often aliens dominant in later-successional stages” or there is “sparse or no vegetation” (p. 57), a situation which occurs in only 7% of their examples and closely matches the share of examples affected by invasive species (Table 16.3). Given this situation, it appears that natural succession is incapable of being unsuccessful, which makes some sense because, naturally, nature decides what success is. Hence, it is impossible to determine if there is a publication bias toward successful studies of succession! Faunal introductions (called reintroduction biology in New Zealand) are briefly covered in the Primer, acknowledging how closely linked all elements of the biota are in nature. Remaining chapters cover the repugnant but essential tasks of administering and financing projects, again useful for beginners and for those in the United States of America. In addition to the Primer itself, there are a suite of web pages that Karen Holl promises to maintain and update, and which are full of images, case studies, and other resources. This information is especially useful to those teaching restoration ecology at the tertiary level. Comparative Plant Succession is basically a very long scientific paper containing extensive meta-analyses of the interrelationships between Earth's biomes and the different types of disturbances initiating succession. It incorporates 530 seres over 8 biomes and 10 types of disturbances. The problem for the authors was to form generalizations from the scattered, location-specific case studies abounding in the literature, in particular, with respect to invasive species (mentioned above), patterns of biodiversity, and successional trajectories. The profiles introducing biomes to the reader (>30 pages) are a little indigestible, though the climate diagrams here reward study, and with the distribution maps, overview each biome. Really part of the methods of the “paper,” these pages are especially useful to those unfamiliar with the concept of biomes or with specific biomes. If needed, more biomic details could be sought in other recent publications, such as Mucina (2019). Disturbance types form the main body of the book (pages 60–223). Summary information, presented in many tables and bar graphs, makes these chapters rather dry, but the interspersion of these with other figures and black/white images, along with the use of sectional headings, facilitate the reader's understanding. Everyone's favorite disturbance is sure to be mentioned here as coverage ranges from volcanoes, through landslides and fire, to abandoned anthropic activities. The assumption the authors make in Comparative Plant Succession is that without disturbance, succession is impossible. But is this really the case? Is a glacial retreat really a form of disturbance, or is it simply a phenomenon leading to the presentation of new ground? To plants of primary succession, this represents an opportunity to add biomass, not to lose it, whereas the definition of disturbance is rapid and extreme loss of plant biomass (Grime, 1979). Interestingly, Comparative Plant Succession does not distinguish between primary (such as occurs after glacial retreats or volcanic eruptions) and secondary succession (after ploughing or fire, etc.). In fact, this distinction is hardly discussed, except to note that secondary succession is generally faster than primary, as shown in the analysis of recovery times in response to disturbance types (Table 16.4). Further, it is a little hard to see a dune as a disturbance type (chapter 8), although, as probably one of the most dynamic of the common habitats on Earth, succession here well rates a mention. The issue of whether successful dune succession is necessarily a good thing remains under debate, especially given that rare species can be quickly lost after early successional stages are completed (e.g., Murphy et al., 2019), a problem besetting restoration as well. Comparative Plant Succession ends with a much needed synthesis, concluding, not unexpectedly, that succession relies on plant species being well-adapted to the disturbance regimes they experience, and, less obviously, that this is strongly related to latitude. Considering future angles, the authors encourage trait research, with improvements in predictability of successional trajectories being the goal. Restoration, as a conservation activity integrating successional knowledge, is specifically covered near the end of the book, where the need for closer integration of the two fields to improve outcomes is highlighted. Given issues of anthropogenic ecosystem degradation and climate change, this is clearly desirable. Both volumes are well referenced. Prach and Walker, in consequence of their meta-analytical approach (82 pages), is exceptionally so, which makes it a useful reference volume for students of succession. Both volumes are also very well presented, and remarkably free (allowing for divergence in grammatical opinion) of irritating errors and typos. Holl (2020) has a few black and white images that are sadly not clear enough to be helpful (in the hardcopy version), whereas Prach and Walker (2020) has 28 color plates placed in the “Synthesis” section. Although attractive, these are a bit distressing because, for portrait-aligned images, half of each page is blank (white) instead of being rotated to landscape orientation and printed at a larger size. Additionally, more details in some of the captions would have better informed and directed the reader. Holl succeeds in her goal for the Primer of “educating the next generation of restoration ecologists.” Prach and Walker also succeed in their comprehensive survey of plant succession, and in highlighting the many gaps for future research. (Sadly, no recipe for cinnamon funnel cake was supplied.) Both books are useful additions to the library of any scientist, but the Primer will appeal more widely. Both clearly demonstrate that current science in restoration and succession still has a while to go to achieve a successfully acidic unification, sensu Bradshaw (1987).

The primary objective of this study was to determine the composition and distribution of Pseudoscorpiones within the Brazilian equatorial oceanic islands. To determine Pseudoscorpiones communities and distribution in coastal environmental habitats of the Brazilian equatorial oceanic islands (Fernando de Noronha archipelago, Rocas Atoll and St. Peter and St. Paul rocks), was defined three zones along the insular environmental gradient in the Brazilian equatorial oceanic islands. These zones include the Sand Beach (SB) closest to the intertidal zone, the Slope Forest (SF) with a sloping terrain and the Top Forest (TF) farthest from the beach. Collecting points were distributed in each zones (SB, SF, and TF) at distances greater than 1 km, with four samples collected at each point approximately 12.5 m apart from each other. The TF zone is observed only in Fernando de Noronha. In our study we found pseudoscorpions exclusively on the islands of the Fernando de Noronha archipelago. We collected 5 species from the Hesperolpiidae and Syarinidae families. The SF habitats exhibited greater species richness, while the Upper Forest habitats showed greater population abundance. Notably, we recorded pseudoscorpions (Ideoblothrus amazonicus) in bird nests (Sula dactylatra) on Rata Island, suggesting the use of nests as habitat, reproduction, and, possibly, occasional transport to and from other habitats. No pseudoscorpions were found in SB environments. This is the first survey of the pseudoscopion fauna in Brazilian oceanic islands, we found the genera Apolpium, Pachyolpium, Ideoblothrus and Microblothrus, with a limited number of species. Landscape changes and tourism can threaten this incredible newly discovered community, vital for monitoring environmental changes in this delicate ecosystem.

1227.0,"Synopsis of the vernacular names and the economic use of the indigenous orchids of Java
","van den Brink, R.",,,,,1937.0,,,38,51,,,,,,1,1,"Blumea. Supplement
",,,,,,"The Netherlands’ Indies are part of those humid tropical regions where innumerable species of orchids either may hang down, sometimes in large numbers, from the trunks and branches of trees and shrubs or grow terrestrially in woods or elsewhere. Nevertheless, to every naturalist who takes the trouble of ascertaining the attitude of the native population towards the orchid-family, it at once becomes clear that up to this very moment most of these plants have only succeeded in obtaining a very modest place in the domestic life and even in the interest of the natives. The beauty of the flowers of so very many species seems never or hardly at all to have been observed by them. This is so much the more noteworthy because in other cases the native has usually invented a name, if not a use, for most plants in his surroundings, even for the rarest and most unimportant ones. As regards orchids this has never happened. These plants seem never to have played any part in religious ceremonies and in the numerous myths they are mentioned at best by a few words. On none of the old monuments they are immortalized; even on ornaments of a later date one usually seeks in vain for these plants or their flowers. How is this aloofness of the natives towards such an important part of the flora of their country to be accounted for? Orchids never were of much use either in domestic life or in the domain of medicinal science. Only with the arrival of the Europeans or, more correctly speaking, not before a very short time ago, some interest for orchids was raised with the natives. But this took, practically, only place in imitation of the foreigner, especially when the natives began to see that money was to be made in the orchid-trade. Here and there this unnatural predilection has already lead to consequences of alarming dimensions, because it has not rarely effected the complete or partial extermination of valuable species in regions where formerly they grew copiously. Nevertheless a change in the native denomination of orchids can hardly be observed. All these plants are simply called Anggrèk or Angkrèk and, as a rule, it is not deemed necessary to add a specific name. Only very few orchids can really boast of such a name; most of them remain anonymous. The names Angkrèk panèli and Angkrèk lotjis, Spatulotjis or Spatuklotis are mere corruptions of Vanilla and Spathoglottis. Angkrèk bulan (Phalaenopsis amabilis) and Anggrèk matjan (Vanda tricolor), though both composed of genuinely native words, do not seem to be quite original, though this case is not identical with the two former ones; these names seem only translations of the Dutch names Maan-orchidee (Moon-orchid) and Tijger-orchidee (Tigerorchid). Yet some specific denominations exist, as a rule with some unimportant addition to the word Anggrèk or Angkrèk, e.g. běněr (bětul) = true; beureum (mèrah) = red; bodas (putih) = white; konèng (kuning) = yellow; gědè (běsar) = big; leutik (kětjil) = small, and such-like which, as a matter of fact, have little to do with the notion of species. Very often they only seem to have been invented by plantcollectors wishing to content troublesome interrogators by some plausible answer. Finally there exist some poetic names, for the greater part of very recent date, of which it is likewise difficult to ascertain whether they are really true ones or came into existence by European influences. From the foregoing, in my opinion, it sufficiently appears that the natives hardly knew how to distinguish plants of this group which, in our eyes, is so very interesting. Once more, how is this fact to be accounted for? He who knows better is, of course, free to say so, but to me this enigmatical aloofness of the natives towards orchids seems to prove that these plants do not interest him in any way. The same case presents itself with most Europeans as regards funguses, mosses, algae a.s.o., groups of plants growing in our immediate environment, unsurveyable to many, which seem not to stir our imagination. I cannot find any other explanation of the fact. Notwithstanding what I have said herebefore it may be of interest to shortly discuss which value part at least of the native population of Java sets to orchids, not exclusively regarding the very small economic worth of a few ones but especially with a view to the denomination of the diverse species. Most of the popular names mentioned beneath have proved to be of recent date. Hence they are not yet universally used; often they are of local value only; sometimes they were invented by cunning plant collectors for the benefit of their employers. Nevertheless they are worthy of being registered, with discrimination of course and spelled in the right way. By doing so we may in future attain a better surveyable and more reliable denomination of orchids than could be made now. Everyone who is acquainted with the love felt by the natives for nature and with their extensive knowledge of the multitude of forms shown by the flora of their surroundings, knows quite well how important it is, and will ever be, to judiciously exchange thoughts with them. The native likes to hoax those who do not understand him and it leaves him quite cool whether by his conduct the European thinks to have found one reason more of storming furiously against the traditional irreliability of native information about plants and plant-names. He has had to swallow severer reproaches than the annihilating opinion of incompetent persons. The fault does not lie exclusively with the natives nor entirely with the Europeans but is caused by the lack of a universally acknowledged classification of the popular names in existence. My treatise aims at contributing my mite to a correct valuation of the notions of both parties. Therefore, let us not begin with stumbling over the numerous brand-new plant-names met with at present everywhere but let us express the hope that, once sifted, they will prove useful enough to enable one to find his way in the Indian flora. Wherefore should we hesitate to register names unknown up to now, because they are not yet generally used throughout the island? If ever, then now surely the time has come to take a broad view of this matter, now that the interest shown for orchids by the different races of the population is rapidly increasing, though modern fashion may play a great part in pushing it forward.",,,,,,,,,,,,Yes,,,,,,,0.994560182094574,1,0.0013066284623329235,1.0,5,486.0

",,,,"The Madeira and Porto Santo Islands have both witnessed substantial habitat loss since their initial colonization. Despite their small size and the degradation of their natural habitats, they harbor a rich diversity of terrestrial invertebrates, including a significant number of endemic species. While research on Orthoptera fauna has predominantly focused on the largest island of Madeira, the smaller island of Porto Santo has remained relatively understudied. Fieldwork on both islands has led to the discovery of Oecanthus dulcisonans Gorochov, 1993 in the Madeira archipelago (Porto Santo and Madeira) for the first time. This species was described based on specimens collected in Tenerife and the Arabian Peninsula. However, its distribution, which includes parts of Africa, Western Asia, and some localities in Southern Europe, remains poorly understood. Oecanthus dulcisonans is morphologically very similar to Oecanthus pellucens (Scopoli, 1763), the only species of this genus previously recorded for the island of Madeira. Due to this resemblance, doubts have arisen regarding which of these two species is present in Madeira. By examining new material of O. pellucens , we have confirmed the presence of this species on Madeira as well. These new findings highlight the fact that, for these species, the Madeira archipelago represents the western limit of their distributional ranges in the Palearctic region.

",,"Wiley
",,,,"Abstract Insular evolution on archipelagos generates a significant proportion of global biodiversity, yet islands are among the ecosystems most sensitive to accelerating anthropogenic disturbance, introductions of non‐native species, and emerging pathogens, among other conservation challenges. The Alexander and Haida Gwaii archipelagos along North America's North Pacific Coast support a disproportionate number of endemic taxa compared to other high‐latitude terrestrial ecosystems. In this region, endemics in Canada are explicitly protected, but in the United States, endemics have been operationally ignored. We reviewed regional research on terrestrial mammals and endemics from 2000–2022 to guide wildlife management. Elevated regional endemism is due to a combination of deep and shallow temporal processes (i.e., long‐term refugial isolation vs. recent colonization). With adequate sampling, genomic analyses are well‐suited to identifying nuanced patterns of divergence and endemism, thereby facilitating a deeper understanding of regional diversity. We identified 18 mammalian endemics in Southeast Alaska, USA, at varying taxonomic scales, but research effort has significant taxonomic biases and sampling infrastructure remains inadequate. Of the 66 terrestrial and aquatic mammal species in Southeast Alaska, only 55% are represented by ≥10 archived samples over the last 2 decades. Across taxa, major spatial and temporal sampling gaps limit interpretations of wildlife responses to changing environmental conditions. The Tongass National Forest is spread across an island archipelago, and climate change is projected to have disproportionate impacts on island endemics worldwide. In this case, the United States Forest Service is not closely monitoring endemic taxa, as was required by the Tongass Land Management Plan in 1997. Our review underscores a need for increased consideration of how endemism can be incorporated into land and wildlife management across the Alexander Archipelago. Moving forward, we encourage state and federal agencies, Indigenous communities, and international collaborators to continue to partner with natural history biorepositories to ensure strategic wildlife sampling infrastructure is built and made accessible to the broader scientific community as part of the land management process.

Nine 20x20m plots and 18 line transects were established for the floral inventory. The faunal assessment was conducted in transects laid in three sites within Paranas. Secondary data was collected from published articles regarding biodiversity in Samar Island Natural Park (SINP). The list shows 99 plant species representing 63 genera and 44 families. Eighteen species were identified as non-endemic and 38 species were Philippine endemics. New island records of Tectaria calcarea (C. Presl) Copel., Artocarpus rubrovenius Warb. and Hancea wenzeliana (Slik) S.E.C.Sierra, Kulju &amp; Welzen were also reported. Eleven plants are listed as endangered in the IUCN Red List and/or DENR DAO 2017-11. Also, 106 vertebrates were recorded in a faunal inventory, including 4 amphibians, 9 reptiles, 84 avifauna, and 9 mammal species, with overall endemism of 71 (67%). A new locality record of Platymantis bayani was noted in Paranas. Twenty-one vertebrate species were listed as threatened in the IUCN Red List and/or DENR DAO 2019-09. This biodiversity information strengthens the nomination of SINP as a UNESCO World Natural Heritage Site, as this supports SINP’s outstanding universal value. The checklist is also essential for the formulation of policies and management strategies for the conservation and protection of kaigangan (forest over limestone).

We were unable to detect invasive terrestrial mammals on any of the 14 islands. We found native mice (Peromyscus maniculatus) and voles (Microtus townsendi) on one island each, and native raccoons (Procyon lotor pacifica) on three islands. We speculate that the nearly ubiquitous presence of native river otters (Lontra canadensis) along with native predatory birds may be preventing immigrant invasive mammals (primarily house mice [Mus musculus] and rats [Rattus spp.]) from gaining a foot-hold on the islands. Inadequate habitat and/or island size and distance from larger islands and their source populations along with insufficient trap nights may also have contributed to the non-detection of small mammals on the islands we surveyed. For the best chance at keeping these islands free of invaders, we recommend future surveys using continuous measurement methods (e.g., track plates and monitoring blocks) for early detection of future invasions.","0029-344X

",,,,"Oceanic islands are particularly vulnerable to the global decline of biological diversity, suffering disproportionally large losses of endemic species. A primary tool for mitigating species loss is the establishment of protected area networks. The 2030 Global Biodiversity Framework target calls for the protection of 30% of Earth’s land surface by 2030. This study identifies areas within the Tropical Important Plant Areas network of the British Virgin Islands (BVI), to better inform the expansion of the current protected area network with the objective of conserving the BVI’s unique flora. We identified and applied conservation targets for five threatened habitats and 34 species of conservation concern, including four endemic to the BVI. A total of 5,248 georeferenced plant records for the 34 species collected through decades of collaborative work between the National Parks Trust of the Virgin Islands and the Royal Botanical Gardens, Kew, along with the distribution of five threatened habitats were used within the decision support system MARXAN to identify four spatial portfolios to guide the expansion of the BVI’s current protected area network. Highlighting the need to expand the current (2007–2017) Protected Areas System Plan in the BVI, we found that the current Plan only covers 15% of terrestrial land and does not meet the conservation targets for plants and habitats. The portfolios identified in our analysis efficiently expand the current Protected Areas System Plan to strategically expand coverage for all conservation features, with two main portfolios reaching all defined conservation targets for protection. Notably, to evaluate options not requiring land purchase, we extracted areas within state-owned Crown land from two main identified portfolios and found that the two Crown land-portfolios could protect 28% and 23% of the BVI, respectively, while meeting the targets for most plants of conservation concern. However, to reach 30% land protection and meet the conservation targets for all plant species, including endemics, private land would need to be considered for this inclusion within the protected area network. Our results provide science-based guidance for the selection of candidate protected area expansion sites that include threatened plants and habitats for reaching the 2030 Biodiversity Framework targets. While systematic conservation planning can provide guidance on protected area expansion, it is important to evaluate and prioritise conservation actions, based on multiple solutions and available resources. We recommend similar approaches are applied more broadly throughout the Caribbean and other archipelagos across the world.

",,,,"The land snails and slugs have the highest level of endemism among all major animal groups on the California Channel Islands, with nearly 75% of the native terrestrial species confined to one or more of the 8 islands. In spite of this endemism, and in spite of the rarity of some species, the snails and slugs are one of the most poorly known groups. We present the first comprehensive overview of the land mollusk fauna of the Channel Islands, along with the results of recent intensive inventory studies. Surveys on San Clemente Island have increased the number of land mollusk species known from that island by 50%, and a single survey trip to Santa Rosa Island more than doubled the number of species known on that island. More additions to the land snail and slug fauna are certain for the poorly surveyed northern Channel Islands. This new information has provided insight into trends in species diversity and biogeographic patterns, with marked differences in species composition between the northern and southern islands. Our surveys to date suggest a strong link between the recovery of native vegetation on the islands and the population status of land snails and slugs, with substantially larger numbers of native mollusks on those islands that have been free of nonnative mammals the longest. Survey work is continuing, but it is clear that some very rare endemic snails and slugs on the islands merit specific management attention.

",,,,"In agricultural landscapes, free-water surface flow wetlands (FWS) are constructed mainly to improve water quality; however, their contribution to biodiversity conservation is increasingly recognised. To inform biodiversity management in FWS treating agricultural runoff, we surveyed the vegetation and fauna assemblages in five established FWS in a lowland, pastoral landscape in the central North Island, New Zealand. The FWS had been established for between 3 and 19 years, planted with a restricted range of native plant species, and fenced to exclude livestock access. Larger wetlands hosted significantly more plant and mammal species. However, other than wetland size, we found few other significant relationships between wetland habitat, landscape characteristics, and measures of biodiversity (total species, proportion of native species, number of wetland specialists, or threatened species). We recorded one-hundred and thirteen plant, twenty bird, five mammal, eighty-five terrestrial invertebrates, forty-seven aquatic invertebrates, six fish, and two amphibian species inhabiting the FWS. Native species comprised 96% of the total aquatic invertebrate fauna identified. For other taxa, native flora and fauna accounted for half or less than half of all species identified: 53% terrestrial invertebrates, 50% fish, 45% birds, 32% plants, and 0% amphibian and mammal species. Few wetland specialists (aquatic or wetland-adapted) or threatened native species were detected, probably reflecting the limited range of wetland plant species in initial plantings and the difficulties native taxa face when colonising new habitat where potential reservoirs of colonist species are also depauperate or too distant. FWS support native biodiversity, but further enhancements may require active management of exotic and pest species to minimise competition or predation on native species.

In Reunion Island, pristine natural habitats cover 30% of the territory, the largest area of intact habitats in the Mascarene Archipelago. To ensure the protection of these habitats and rare species, a national park was established in 2007 and has since been included on UNESCO's 2010 World Heritage List. To tackle biological invasions, an IAS Strategy was developed in Reunion Island in 2010 and then implemented in two Operational Control Plans for Invasive Species (2010-2013 and 2014-2017). Here, we analyzed the efficiency of these plans. Semi-structured interviews, SWOT analyses, workshops and all relevant data and references about biological invasions in Reunion Island were used to assess the efficiency. Costs over 8 years amounted to €20 million, and were mainly allocated to control the expansion of IAS in Reunion Island. We identified the most important invasive species in terrestrial biomes and developed a public detection platform to enable prompt, practical responses to new invasions on the island. The efforts of various stakeholders(public institutions, research organizations, universities, associations) is at the heart of the control of IAS in Reunion Island. This diversity of stakeholders allowed working to take place simultaneously on several fronts. Despite significant spending for the island and a strong local effort, biological invasions appear to have increased in many protected areas, causing UNESCO World Heritage to drop their conservation status for the island in 2017. Our findings suggest that the IAS Strategy in Reunion Island should be substantially modified if impacts are to be effectively mitigated. Rather than attempting to operate on all species and in all areas, prioritizing both species and areas and setting goals and monitoring their effectiveness through indicators within a framework of adaptive management is essential.

",,,,,,"The mangrove forests, which support the survival of both terrestrial and aquatic inhabitants, are considered some of the most productive ecosystems. Mangrove faunal diversity is well known for the vertebrates and invertebrates but is poorly known for insects. Mangroves and insects have strong relationships in which mangroves provide a suitable habitat for insect habitation. In contrast, the feeding activities of insects contribute to the litter detritus formation and sustainability of the mangrove ecosystem. They connect mangroves with adjoined terrestrial and marine ecosystems by their eco-services such as pollination, herbivory, predation, and being food for other predators. Lepidopterans, consisting of moths and butterflies, are the most widely recognized insects as indicators of the ecosystem's health and are considered in conservation strategies. As the information on the Lepidopteran fauna of mangrove has not been revealed in Sri Lanka, this study was performed to explore the diversity of butterflies and moths in the Mandaitivu mangrove ecosystem from August 2019 to March 2020 located in the Northern Province of Sri Lanka. True mangrove species such as Avicennia marina, Rhizophora mucronata, Ceriops tagal and Pemphis acidula are distributed as patches around this island. Adult as well as larval stages of butterflies and moths were collected from two different locations based on the abundance of the mangrove vegetation at the west and south border of the Mandaitivu Island through sweep netting and hand-picking methods. They were then identified based on their morphological characteristics. A total of 13 butterfly species, belonging to four families, and 6 moth species, belonging to three families were recorded. The highest species composition was recorded from Avicennia marina than Rhizophora mucronata which has fewer insects probably due to the thickness of their leaves. The plain tiger (Danaus chrysippus) was the most common and abundant butterfly followed by Mottled Emigrant (Catopsilia pyranthe) and the Small Salmon Arab (Colotis amata). The Yellow Pansy (Junonia hierta), the critically endangered (CR) species was also found. The other twelve species are listed as least concerned (LC) nationally. All the moth species recorded are listed as not assessed as per the IUCN red list. These results confirm that further extensive surveys in the Mandaitivu mangrove ecosystem will expose more diverse assemblages of lepidopterans that can be utilized in threat assessment and conservation strategy planning.

",,,,"Abstract Monitoring wildlife populations through the collection of abundance and distribution data across climatic seasons and multiple years is critical to understanding wildlife spatiotemporal dynamics. This is especially important in landscapes faced with natural and anthropogenic disturbances, which include the state of Rhode Island, USA. Rhode Island is the second most densely populated state in the United States, yet the landscape remains highly forested. Similar to many areas in the region, land cover change and conversion to non‐habitat cover types continue to be an issue as a result of increased anthropogenic disturbance, in addition to recent natural disturbance including forest structural changes from the spongy moth caterpillar ( Lymantria dispar ). These changes in land cover types and landscape patterns have the potential to positively or negatively affect wildlife communities, and thus, it is increasingly important to monitor wildlife populations. Camera traps provide an efficient way to inventory and monitor a large spatial area and record detections of a wide variety of terrestrial vertebrates. We began surveying the state of Rhode Island as part of a focal study on bobcats ( Lynx rufus , 2018–2020) and later fishers ( Pekania pennanti , 2020–2023) while documenting all species of terrestrial vertebrates detected at camera survey locations. We placed cameras in areas with land cover appropriate for the original target species—primarily forests and forested wetlands—and avoided placing cameras directly along hiking trails or roads. The state was divided into two sections—west and east—to maximize study area coverage with limited equipment. Cameras were deployed for at least six weeks in each survey period and section. In total, we monitored 249 survey sites in the state over 12 survey periods (six winter seasons, five summer seasons, and one spring season). We collected 244,013 unique detections from 39 terrestrial vertebrate species (25 mammal species, 13 bird species, and non‐personnel humans) throughout the study. These data provide spatial and temporal detection information that is useful for investigating the changes in wildlife populations over time and varying degrees of development through analyses including single species, multi‐species, dynamic, and diel occupancy modeling. Results of these analyses can be used to understand how a changing landscape impacts wildlife species. The data are openly available for reuse, and please cite this data paper when these data are used in other materials.

","Joyce, Trevor",,Keystone species,,,2016.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"The human capacity to expand niche breadth through cultural evolution has propelled humans into keystone ecological roles in many ecosystems. In particular terrestrial animal assemblages have experienced radical reductions in diversity and size distribution. Oceanic habitats have experienced shorter histories of exploitation and typically retain faunal assemblages that more closely resemble pre-human Pleistocene assemblages. Although the direct harvest of many marine mammal and seabird species has diminished in recent decades, these assemblages now face an onslaught of novel human impacts in marine and oceanic island habitats. Stressors range from noise and chemical pollution to the introduction of invasive mammalian predators on oceanic islands. To develop a better understanding of how these disparate effects will impact the ecologies and conservation statuses of wide-ranging, dynamic, and patchy seabird and marine mammal populations, this dissertation leveraged the use of two extensive observational datasets collected by and in collaboration with the NOAA-NMFS Southwest Fisheries Science Center. In the first section (Chapters 1-3) I used satellite tag and biopsy sampling 1) to describe vertical habitat use and biogeographic distribution patterns, and 2) to develop a systematic framework to better understand foraging ecology trade-offs in seven species of toothed whales from the Bahamas. In the second section (Chapters 4-5) I have applied innovative modeling techniques to estimate population abundance and growth rate parameters using an extensive time series of seabird transect surveys.

",,,,"Abstract Southeast Asia hosts more felid species than any other region and, although smaller (&lt; 30 kg) felids have important ecological roles, regional conservation has mainly focused on a few charismatic big cats. Information on the ecology and conservation status of small felids is often lacking or geographically limited. We used empirically derived scale-optimized models for seven species in three regions of Southeast Asia (mainland, Borneo and Sumatra) to evaluate the effectiveness of the existing protected areas network in preserving suitable habitats, and to map suitable areas lacking protection. Finally, we assessed whether small felids are good proxies of broader regional terrestrial biodiversity. On the mainland, the largest and most suitable habitats occurred in the Northern Forest Complex of Myanmar and in the region between Eastern Myanmar, Laos and Vietnam. In these areas we also highlighted the most important protected areas. In Borneo, the most suitable habitats occurred in the central highlands and in the protected areas of Sabah. In Sumatra, the strongholds of habitat suitability were the Barisan Mountains, in the western extent of the island, and were highly concentrated within existing protected areas. We also found that the aggregated habitat suitability for small felids was correlated more strongly to terrestrial vertebrate biodiversity than was any single felid species individually, suggesting that areas that are suitable for multiple felid species have an association with high overall biodiversity. Overall, our assessment of the distribution of small felids in Southeast Asia highlights the fundamental importance of protected areas for biodiversity conservation, given that most species were highly associated with protected areas and regions with large extents of forest. Our results are a clarion call to expand the extent, and improve the conservation management, of protected areas in the remaining core habitat areas for multiple species in Southeast Asia, and to work to enhance and protect connectivity between them to ensure long-term demographic and genetic exchange among the region’s remaining wildlife populations.

",,,,,,"Paleontological resource inventories for the parks of the National Park Service's Mediterranean Coast Inventory and Monitoring Network (MEDN) indicate a significant Late Cretaceous and Cenozoic fossil record for the southern California coast and islands. These inventories document over 100 million years of biologic and geologic changes along the Pacific coast of southern California. During 2012, comprehensive paleontological resource data were compiled for Cabrillo National Monument (CABR), Channel Islands National Park (CHIS), and Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area (SAMO). This recent work expands the paleontological resource data previously compiled for each of the parks in 2003 and during the SAMO paleontological survey of 2004. Fossil plants, invertebrates, and vertebrates and trace fossils represent both marine and terrestrial life along the ancestral coast of southern California. Within the boundaries of SOMA, 38 fossil taxa have been described from specimens discovered there, and 19 more have been described from CHIS. Among the significant fossils found within the MEDN are the pygmy mammoths of CHIS, which continue to be a subject of scientific research. Recent work at SAMO has helped refine the stratigraphic interpretation of the park's geology; helped provide additional documentation of the Miocene flora and fauna; and led to the description of new taxa, including the Upper Cretaceous gastropod Pyropsis aldersoni (Squires 2011) and the Paleocene crab Costacopluma squiresi (Nyborg et al. 2009). The recent MEDN paleontological resource inventory will help stimulate future research, education, interpretation, and proper management of these important paleontological resources.

",,,,"Insect Conservation: A Global Synthesis. Samways, M.J.2019. CABI, Oxford, UK. 560 pp. £55.00 (paperback). ISBN 9781789241679. “Synthesis: the mixing of different ideas, influences, or things to make a whole that is different, or new” (dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/synthesis). This is what Michael Samways set out to provide in this 500+ page volume. I guess this much space is required just to begin tackling a problem with millions of actors. Millions of actors that are now in the middle of an apocalyptic movie, one of those B-rated ones, where there is a lot of gore and blood. Try writing the script of this movie. Your job is to describe the fate of all the actors, to which you must give a name, describe how they make a living, and how they are related to each other. Now, create some threat, maybe global warming, maybe wipe out of entire nations. Quantify how many were sacrificed, but do not forget about the survivors. Describe what strategies were used to save them. Try to give a happy ending, so that people leave the theater with some sense of hope. Five hundred pages do not seem that much anymore, do they? Maybe an encyclopedia would be enough? Samways has been one of the strongest advocates for insect (and arthropod) conservation for many decades. Even before anyone cared for them, far from the current growing interest in the subject, he was already fighting for insects and other invertebrates. He was right there with Ed Wilson, Terry Erwin, Tim New, and the very few others who saw biodiversity for what it is, not for what it looks like. Why should the rest of us care about the “little things that run the world” (Wilson 1987)? This new book starts precisely there: tackling the perception problem. Describing the rise and fall of insects, their diversity, their roles in ecosystems, how important they are to us, and the scales at which we can move to take effective action. Particularly insightful is the philosophical aspect of insect conservation. If 99% of the species that ever lived are now extinct, why should we care about the current 1%? Will not new insect species, as for all taxa, just evolve and replace the disappearing ones? Samways argues that our sentience makes the difference. We know we are causing extinctions, and we know we can halt them. Insect conservation psychology (Simaika & Samways 2018) will play a major role in the future, and there is the need for advocates from all areas, from entomology to sociology, to pedagogy, to the arts. Given the dimension of the task, landscape-scale solutions become almost inevitable in insect conservation (Samways et al. 2020). Land sharing and land sparing, ecologically more benign agriculture, and similar solutions aim to reconcile species and ecosystem services with human activity outside (but also inside) protected areas. Despite the recent calls for 30% of global terrestrial areas to be protected by 2030 and 50% to be protected by 2050, conservation is increasingly seen as depending on the contribution of unprotected areas. Given the ubiquity and endemism levels of insects (many species are restricted to the most unsuspicious and disturbed areas, such as the Crau Plain grasshopper [Prionotropis rhodanica], which is restricted to grazed grasslands in southern France [Bröder et al. 2019]), any field, any city, any forest patch may contain the last remnants of a once-thriving population or species. Islands, both oceanic and terrestrial, are prominently featured in the book, as are population and metapopulation dynamics that emerge in such settings. With increasingly fragmented landscapes resulting from human activities, species often must cross inhospitable areas to maintain natural flows of individuals between patches, and such dynamics often need a helping hand in the shape of ecological corridors. Despite insect conservation usually requiring a focus on landscapes, species are obviously worthy of attention in themselves. And, this is where species traits enter the survival game. Habitat or climatic breadth, dispersal ability, and fecundity all influence the capacity of a species to survive under variable threatening processes. If a species does not possess the traits needed to adapt and occurs in the wrong place at the wrong time, its populations will decrease, may collapse, and at some point, be threatened or even go extinct. Such species should be identified, maybe through assessments under the International Union for Conservation of Nature, and could be the focus of specific measures that involve thinking at the landscape level again. This scale dynamics in insect conservation is considered throughout the book. Unfortunately, given the many gaps in knowledge of insect species (Cardoso et al. 2011), most will not be assessed in the near future, even though some efforts are underway (Hochkirch et al. 2020). Conservation science is forced to perform prioritization and triage. Often, priority species are chosen based on perceptions of conservation professionals, whose preferences for the big, beautiful, or useful are no different form the public's (Sumner et al. 2018). And yet, besides threat levels, there are objective ways to prioritize. Evolutionarily distinct and globally endangered vertebrates have received special attention, attention that should also be paid to invertebrates, or in Samway's words, “conserving the curious” (p. 125). On the other side of the spectrum, rapidly evolving species and the potential for future evolutionary opportunities could also receive attention. From a functional perspective, conserving a full spectrum of ecosystem service providers should also be a priority; many species perform irreplaceable functions throughout their ranges. With such surrogacy strategies, we can only hope that many other, often undescribed, species will also be protected, even if it is a risky strategy and not a panacea. After 5 chapters on general considerations, from landscape to species, the second major section of the book goes into particular habitats. Agricultural development, with its consequent habitat loss and transformation, is one of the main drivers of species declines and deserves special attention. The land-sharing and land-sparing concept is presented as one of the main solutions, as are agrienvironment schemes (as also discussed in Samways et al. 2020). Organic farming; maximization of pollination; nutrient recycling; pest control and other services; integrated pest management, including biological control; and even the controversial use of genetically modified organisms are all problems, because efforts must be made to better understand and apply them, and opportunities, because they can be fundamental for ecosystem and species resilience. Natural habitats, including forests, grasslands, caves, and freshwater, deserve special attention. These are where most species persist; tropical forests, for example, are the most species-rich ecosystems on Earth. Grasslands (including savannahs and mountain landscapes above the tree line), caves, and freshwater habitats are often island-like in that they harbor numerous narrow-range endemics and their importance surpasses their species richness. Threatened by agriculture, livestock husbandry, pollution, fire, extraction activities, invasive species, and so on, each of these habitat types face particular problems that require specific solutions, which Samways mentions and supplies examples of from different parts of the world. Urban habitats also deserve attention and often are the ideal setting for citizen science and increasing awareness of nature. Urban gardens, green roofs, and artificial lakes, all provide opportunities for information, education, and action right at our doorstep. The third and final section of the book is very practical. It considers how to list and monitor species and communities, restore habitats, and minimize species and population losses. Surveying and monitoring are often mixed or confused, yet they are complementary. Compiling an inventory through surveys yields data on alpha diversity, that is, what is where at a given point in time and space. Monitoring, in contrast, provides data on beta diversity, that is, how populations or communities change in space and time. Neither undertaking is an easy task when dealing with megadiverse taxa. Recent discussions of the insect apocalypse have brought forward a number of phylogenetic, functional, habitat, spatial, and temporal biases in monitoring efforts worldwide. Projects are being developed, but a global standardization and optimization is needed if we are ever to know what is really happening to arthropods (Cardoso & Leather 2019). I hope a second edition of this book will refer to a future global monitoring protocol. Among many examples of habitat restoration, Samways guides the reader through the restoration of Cousine Island in the Seychelles. Between 1960 and 2007, the island was restored to close to its pristine state. Two conditions allowed this to happen. First, it is an isolated and small area, thus easy to manipulate. Second, there were small populations of most native plants and insects still surviving in refuge areas. Restoration ecology is extremely complex in most situations, with human and other resources invariably coming up short. Yet, my own experience on the Desertas Islands (Madeira, Portugal) tells me that committed people on small islands can make a difference. Maybe it is time to collect examples that can not only provide guidance, but also give hope to the idea that large-scale restoration with consequent recovery of countless species is possible. This book is a thorough and necessarily incomplete synthesis of how to value and conserve insects in the Anthropocene. Many of the strategies mentioned have been attempted with success in different parts of the world, and we know enough to act immediately (Harvey et al. 2020; Samways et al. 2020). We now need to expand these local strategies. Two features make this book particularly easy to follow. First, the wealth of illustrations with extensive legends that allow the reader to follow all the arguments made in the main text. These help frame full concepts within a limited space. Second, these illustrations are complemented by a list of key points at the end of each chapter, which reiterates the arguments in bulleted points or take-away messages. The book will be of value in classroom instruction and to practitioners worldwide and serves as a guide for further developments in the area. A final word, as a spider expert myself, although insects are now receiving global attention, many of the threats and solutions to these threats apply to other arthropods (arachnids, myriapods, crustaceans, etc.) and even to other invertebrates (molluscs, annelids, etc.). Maybe the insights from work with these groups can also help insect conservation. I hope for a second edition that widens the book's scope at least to arthropod conservation.

Using abiotic and biotic environmental variables, we developed a terrestrial habitat suitabilitymodel for this species on Kauai to predict habitat that could be suitable in the absence of anthropogenic threats. Inaddition, we developed a habitat/threat-isolation index incorporating information from our suitability model to identifyregions of structurally suitable habitat with less exposure to certain anthropogenic threats (relative to other portions of theisland). The habitat suitability model suggests that slope, density of rock fragments within the soil, and native vegetationcover are important factors associated with the current known distribution of the Newell’s shearwater on Kauai, and that amoderate portion of the sloped interior terrain of Kauai could potentially be suitable nesting habitat for this species. Thehabitat/threat-isolation index identified the mountains on the north-central portion of the island as structurally suitablehabitat most isolated from a combination of major anthropogenic disturbances (relative to other portions of the island).Much of this region, however, is privately owned and not designated as an official reserve, which could indicate a need forincreased conservation action in this region in the future.

It includes the construction of a 15 million tonne per annum (mtpa) LNG plant on Barrow Island and a domestic gas plant with the capacity to provide 300 terajoules per day to supply gas to WA.

Barrow Island—where Gorgon will be located—is an internationally significant nature reserve and the site of Australia’s largest onshore operating oil field for the past 45 years. As a world-class example of environmental management, it has shown that conservation and development can successfully co-exist.

Recognising the importance of Barrow Island’s conservation values, the terrestrial and subterranean environmental monitoring program encompasses key ecological elements on Barrow Island including birds, mammals, subterranean fauna, vegetation, and surface water and land forms. These elements are monitored in relation to the potential impact from environmental stressors identified during pre-construction environmental impact assessments.

Here, the author describes the monitoring surveys conducted during the year as appropriate according to the element being considered. All surveys are executed using the Gorgon Project field mobilisation and deployment process, a stringent and dedicated system that ensures all essential health and safety processes are in place and adhered to.

Each element is monitored for signs of positive or negative impact across Barrow Island with comparisons made between the pre-determined Terrestrial Disturbance Footprint (TDF) and areas outside of the TDF in which the Gorgon Project is committed to causing zero environmental harm. Statistical control charts and tiered response triggers based on standard deviations are used to inform management decisions about potential environmental effects attributable to the Gorgon Project.

A continuous review process is in place to ensure all monitoring programs are scientifically robust and use up-to-date methodologies. Monitoring reports are used to assess the validity of each program and supplementary programs aimed at addressing gaps in existing knowledge are started as and when needed. A reporting framework is in place to ensure regulatory authorities are informed and collaborations are sought to advance overall understanding of the ecology and biology of Barrow Island fauna and flora.

The Gorgon Project is operated by an Australian subsidiary of Chevron and is a joint venture of the Australian subsidiaries of Chevron (about 47%), ExxonMobil (25%), Shell (25%), Osaka Gas (1.25%), Tokyo Gas (1%), and Chubu Electric Power (0.417%).","1326-4966

In the Cape Horn Biosphere Reserve (RBCH), created in 2005, this function has been fulfilled with the creation of the Omora Ethnobotanical Park in 2000, and its implementation in 2008 as a co-founder site of the Chilean Network of Studies Long-Term Socio- Ecological (LTSER-Chile). In 2016, this network has been strengthened with the addition of the new Cape Horn Long-Term Socio-Ecological Research Network (LTER-Cape Horn). The latter includes the Omora Ethnobotanical Park, and three new sites added to the monitoring of the sub-Antarctic Magellanic ecoregion. From south to north, the four sites are: (1) Gonzalo Island (56°31’S; 68°43’O), at the southern end of the Diego Ramírez Archipelago, with sub- Antarctic vegetation dominated by grasses and cryptogams, devoid of woody species; (2) Horn Island (55°58’S; 67°13’O), at the southern end of the Cape Horn Archipelago, hosting the southernmost forest ecosystems on the planet, which are dominated by the evergreen beech (Nothofagus betuloides); (3) Omora Ethnobotanical Park (54°57’S; 67°40’O), Navarino Island, an ideal site for studies on climate change and its impact on biota and sub-Antarctic ecosystems, since it protects a watershed that includes a representative mosaic of characteristic habitats of the RBCH in an altitudinal gradient with a thermal decrease analogous to that which occurs with increases in latitude; and (4) Caleta 2 de Mayo Site (54°52’S; 68°41’O), Yendegaia Bay, in an ecotonal zone between evergreen and deciduous forests (product of the local climate gradient), at a site that will be central to future connectivity between Continental Chile, Tierra del Fuego, Navarino Island, and the RBCH. In 2015, UNESCO approved the Report of the First Periodic Review of the RBCH that proposed the protection of the Diego Ramírez Archipelago and the creation of the Diego Ramírez Islands-Drake Passage Marine Park. This goal was achieved with the promulgation of this new park on February 2, 2018, and its entry into force on January 21, 2019 with the publication of the creation decree in the Diario Oficial of Chile. In this context, the new LTER-Cape Horn network acquires great local, national and global relevance. At the local scale, it covers a representative environmental heterogeneity of the great diversity of landscapes and terrestrial, freshwater and marine ecosystems of the RBCH and the sub-Antarctic Magellanic ecoregion. At the national scale, it incorporates sub-Antarctic sites, located at the southern end of South America, to LTSER-Chile and to the Monitoring Network of the Ministry of the Environment. On a global scale, the terrestrial ecosystems of the LTER-Cape Horn network stands out for two main reasons: (1) these sub-Antarctic ecosystems lack a geographical replicate in other continents of the southern hemisphere, and (2) high latitude ecosystems are especially sensitive to global climate change. Thus, the LTER-Cape Horn network helps to overcome critical geographical gaps in the implementation of the International Network for Long-Term Ecological Research (ILTER). In order to articulate these four sites and strengthen the training of technical capacities and knowledge transfer to decision makers in the area of special interest tourism and other sustainable economic activities, the LTER-Cape Horn network will be managed locally from the new Cape Horn Sub-Antarctic Center (Cape Horn Center) that will be inaugurated in Puerto Williams in 2021. The implementation of the LTER-Cape Horn network is based on a close collaboration with various public institutions: Ministry of National Assets, Ministry of the Environment, Subsecretary of Fisheries and Aquaculture of the Ministry of Economy Development and Tourism, National Forestry Service, General Water Directorate of the Ministry of Public Works, Navy of Chile, Chilean Police (Carabineros), Municipality of Cape Horn, Provincial Government of Chilean Antarctica, and the Regional Government of Magallanes and Chilean Antarctica. In the following phases, the LTER-Cape Horn network and the Cape Horn Center aim to strengthen the participation of the local community, especially the Yahgan Indigenous Community of Bahía Mejillones, artisanal fisheries, tour operators, and the educational community, including private actors. Located at the “southern summit” of the Americas, Puerto Williams, capital of the Chilean Antarctic Province emerges as a global hub for transdisciplinary sub-Antarctic research, equipped with a new center and the network of long-term socio-ecological studies. Collaboration with regional, national and international actors will allow the LTER-Cape Horn network and the Cape Horn Center to: (i) provide critical data, which will open up new opportunities for monitoring climate change and its impact on biodiversity and ecosystems in sub-Antarctic latitudes; (ii) consolidate long-term monitoring, which is an essential component to effectively design mitigation and adaptation actions; (iii) strengthen a local sustainable development model that, associated with the Cape Horn Biosphere Reserve, contributes from the south of the world, to a biocultural conservation model that meets the needs of socio-economic well-being and environmental sustainability at multiple regional and planetary scales.",,,,,,,,,,,,No,,,,"fun, ?",,,0.5038786727935076,1,0.37492500509395515,0.6,3,879.0

",,,,"Paleontological and archaeological data collected since the 1950s from the Guadeloupe Islands allow modern and past occurrences of bird species to be compared and changes (colonization, extirpation and extinction) in avian communities over the last 30,000 years to be highlighted. Here we report data from 24 assemblages from sites spread across Basse Terre, Grande Terre, La Désirade, Marie Galante and Les Saintes dating from the Late Pleistocene, before the arrival of humans, to the Historical period, subdivided into five main periods: pre‑human, Archaic, Ceramic, Contact and Colonial. At least 55 taxa have been identified, belonging to 26 families and 16 orders. Approximately 65 % of the identified taxa are the first fossil occurrences documented for the Guadeloupe or Lesser Antilles Islands (36 taxa) and provide a wealth of information for reconstructing the past geographic distribution of avian communities. Furthermore, a large part of the bird species became extinct (2 taxa) or were extirpated (17 taxa) from one or more islands of Guadeloupe, primarily during the Colonial period. Our results show direct and indirect human impact to be the main factor underlying the loss of avian biodiversity in the archipelago. These results are part of a modification of the Caribbean terrestrial vertebrate biocenosis in the second half of the Holocene, via the extinction of a significant number of non-volant terrestrial vertebrates. Among the terrestrial birds, these changes lead to a few extinctions, but mainly, to the local disappearance or reduction in habitat size of most forest birds.

","Mingueza, Laia",,Poaching; Asian elephant; Habitat Fragmentation; Wildlife corridor,,,2018.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"The endangered Bornean elephants (Elephas maximus borneensis) are endemic to the island of Borneo and their survival is being threatened by palm oil production, poaching and human-elephant conflicts. In Central Sabah (Malaysia), the conversion of forests into commercial plantations has led to habitat fragmentation and human-elephant conflicts. The present pilot study aimed to assess the suitability of a protected forest reserve in Central Sabah (INIKEA Forest Rehabilitation project site) for elephants, assess elephant distribution at the site and document the presence of other terrestrial mammals. This was done using a combination of wildlife surveys. The potential role of this forest reserve in wildlife management and conservation is as well discussed.

This study confirms the presence of the Bornean elephant and other endangered mammals like the sun bear (Helarctos malayanus) at the INIKEA site. Results indicate that single bulls, bachelor groups, small family units and herds use this site, which has 8,356ha (42% of the total extension) of suitable elephant habitat. This preliminary assessment suggests that the elephants travel through the main road as well as roam and feed in forested areas and old roads that are mainly flat, relatively easy to access from the main road and nearby rivers. Results also indicate that this site can play an important role as a corridor for the elephants to connect with other forest reserves in Central Sabah and as a refuge to avoid areas highly disturbed by humans. The findings suggest that the rehabilitation of degraded lands and protection of forests can play a key role on the conservation of endangered species and provide a basis to conduct further in-depth surveys and long-term monitoring in the area. Further research is needed to better understand elephant movements in this changing landscape and systematically assess the status of mammalian fauna in the reforested areas.

",,,,"The terrestrial high-Arctic has, so far, escaped the worst impacts of non-native plant establishment. However, increasing human activity and changing climate raise the risk of introductions and establishment, respectively. The lack of biosecurity in the terrestrial Arctic is thus of concern. To facilitate the development of biosecurity measures on the rapidly warming and highly trafficked archipelago of Svalbard, we generated ecological niche models to map the bioclimatic niche potential of 27 non-native established or door-knocker vascular plant species across Svalbard, identify species with a high risk of widespread occupancy, and locate hotspots of potential current and future invasions. Under the current climate the three species with the highest threat in terms of broad potential area of occupancy and known invasion potential were Deschampsia cespitosa , Ranunculus subborealis subsp. villosus and Saussurea alpina . However, under future climate, most of the considered species have potentially wide distributions across the archipelago. Remote eastern islands were a hotspot region for broader potential establishment of non-native species under the current climate. Our results suggest that many non-native plant species have a broader macroclimatic niche on Svalbard than they currently occupy, and that other factors probably limit both dispersal and establishment outside their current localised distributions. Environmental management on Svalbard has a limited window of opportunity to act early in containing and preventing the spread of non-native plant species beyond the few settlements where they currently exist. Moreover, preventing introductions and establishments on the remote and rarely visited islands of Edgeøya, Barentsøya and Bjørnøya could be also a priority action to safeguard sanctuaries of the archipelago’s natural ecosystems.

It is now planned to protect some of the forests from further logging by incorporating them into a National Park. A survey of plant species in the regenerating forests and surrounding land on the Peninsula was performed to assess the taxonomic and ecological diversity of the trees and shrubs, including figs and palms, and also the orchids presently to be found on the Peninsula. The degree of invasion by introduced plant species was also assessed. Of 67 tree and shrub species it was found that 17 were endemic to the Fijian islands, 40 others were indigenous and ten were introduced. The normal habitats of these species included dense, open and secondary forest, showing that trees with a range of ecological characteristics were still present. Endemic and indigenous species of both figs and palms were found, and also terrestrial and epiphytic orchids. No severe infestations of introduced species were observed. It is concluded that the forests of the Peninsula are of sufficient conservation value to justify National Park status.

Here, we compare the structure and carrion consumption efficiency of the scavenger communities occurring in terrestrial and shallow marine habitats on and around a Mediterranean island. During July 2018, we monitored the consumption of 23 fish (Sparus aurata) and 34 bird (Larus michahellis) carcasses in Grosa Island (Murcia, SE Spain), which were placed both on land and below water. We recorded the vertebrate and invertebrate species occurring at carcass sites by means of visual inspection (vertebrates and invertebrates in marine habitats and invertebrates in terrestrial habitats) and motion-triggered cameras (vertebrates in terrestrial habitats). The vertebrate scavenger community was richer in the marine environment, whereas the total and invertebrate community were richer in the terrestrial one. The scavenger community was usually well-structured (i.e., nested), with the exception of the community associated with fish carcasses on land, which were very efficiently detected and consumed by yellow-legged gulls. In contrast, gulls left conspecific carcasses almost untouched, thus allowing longer persistence of gull carcasses on land and their exploitation by a diverse insect community. Our study shows important differences in the scavenging process associated with both the environment and carcass type.

The Yáláƛi (Goose Island) Archipelago is a group of islands in Heiltsuk (Haíɫzaqv) territory on the Central Coast of British Columbia, Canada. Not only has this region been important to the Heiltsuk for millennia but also it is both a federally and internationally recognized important bird area. In this study, we compare data collected by Charles J. Guiguet, a biologist who documented bird communities at Yáláƛi in the summer of 1948, to three different contemporary surveys and to citizen-science data. We find that the relative abundances of forest bird species (i.e., birds that use the terrestrial island ecosystems) in 1948 differed to those observed in systematic surveys in 2011. While Orange-crowned Warblers, Dark-eyed Juncos, and Red Crossbills comprised 55% of detections by Guiguet in 1948, the three most abundant species in 2011 were Bald Eagles, Varied Thrushes, and Pacific Wrens, and these accounted for only 25% of detections. Although we could not make a quantitative comparison, we provide summaries of each species observed in surveys or reported on eBird. We also incorporate Heiltsuk place-based knowledge to enrich our discussion of the variability in bird communities over time, from how changes in mammal communities and human use may have shaped vegetation dynamics to how large-scale natural phenomena impacted topography. To understand which birds are present and how their communities are changing over time, we recommend continued monitoring of the bird communities at Yáláƛi.","2045-7758

The Corridor of Marojejy, Anjanaharibe‐Sud Special Reserve, Tsaratanana (COMATSA) is a newly protected corridor system that faces deforestation and lacks detailed assessments of its native carnivore community. We deployed 44 motion‐activated trail cameras to identify which terrestrial carnivores are found within the rainforest corridor landscape of COMATSA‐Sud and Marojejy National Park, and to examine carnivore occupancy, relative activity and the impacts of habitat edge. Our sampling array operated from October 20, 2021, to February 10, 2022 (113 days) and confirmed the presence of four species in Eupleridae: Cryptoprocta ferox , Fossa fossana , Galidia elegans , and Galidictis fasciata , as well as a non‐native carnivore species: Canis familiaris . We show that carnivore occurrences significantly increase with distance to forest edges. We discuss the negative impacts of forest loss on native carnivores and highlight the threats posed by the non‐native carnivore C. familiaris . Our findings spotlight faunal detections across the corridor and indicate that fewer native carnivores are found in the corridor compared to nearby protected areas, suggesting that deforestation correlates with a skewed distribution of carnivore detections. Based on our data, we provide management recommendations for the protection of the forest corridor and its endemic faunal community.

Measurements of permafrost depth along a 6-km-long profile and on permanent research plots was done repeatedly using a probe approach. Soil samples in vertical profile of some probes were taken for analyses of grain structure and mass/volume soil characteristics.

",,,,"The Science Museum of the University of Coimbra (MCUC) manages the oldest zoological collections in Portugal. The molluscs are among the most relevant invertebrates within this collection, with over one hundred thousand specimens. A significant part of the Portuguese malacological collection in MCUC comes from the Madeira Archipelago, a group of oceanic islands with a high diversity of terrestrial molluscs and a hotspot of endemic taxa. A recent review of land snails from Madeira hosted at the MCUC revealed that there were around 130 lots and 2,000 specimens offered by naturalists since the 19 th Century and none of them had been previously digitized. A significant number of these specimens was offered by António da Costa de Paiva (Barão de Castelo de Paiva) who described ten land snail species from the Madeira Archipelago in 1866 and published an extensive monograph on non-marine molluscs in 1867. The main goal of our work was to carry out the inventory of the mollusc collections from the Madeira Archipelago in the database of MCUC, and to discuss the importance of specimens’ digitization for making the collections known and available to researchers and the general public. We inserted data for 1,916 specimens of the Madeira Archipelago collection in the MCUC database ‘ In Natura - Natural Heritage Management’ with information on their taxonomy, old inventory numbers (if available), correspondent lot, collector and the study areas, complemented with information about habitat, among others. In addition, we also included photographs of the lots and of some of the most remarkable individuals in the database. The specimens were then reconditioned and identified in the general mollusc collection, although the identification and designation of the type material are still lacking. Digitization is crucial in the field of biological collections in order to transfer specimen data onto worldwide accessible repositories, potentially benefiting the work of researchers and other stakeholders in the ecological and conservation communities. For instance, even when researchers are intensively searching for a type material in a certain collection, if the data are neither known nor available, they cannot trace it and compare it with their material. Thus, this work is fundamental for the accessibility of the malacological collections in the MCUC for researchers and also the society-at-large that has the possibility of consulting them through the digital museum (http://museudaciencia.inwebonline.net), as well as for the dissemination of the important historical and scientific heritage of the University of Coimbra and Portugal, both nationally and internationally.

Island Press, Washington, D.C. 824 pp. $85 (paperback). ISBN 1-55963-923-7. A significant part of the Earth's biodiversity is contained in the Indo-Pacific region, extending from the Indian subcontinent to New Guinea and Melanesia, including southern Asia and Southeast Asia. The area includes 5 bioregions, 140 ecoregions, and 6 of the 25 global hotspots of biodiversity. In our efforts to conserve global biodiversity, then, few areas are as important as the Indo-Pacific region. This volume by Wikramanayake et al. is more than a conservation assessment. The material in the book covers almost all issues relevant to the development of a conservation strategy. Thus, there are chapters on the distribution of biodiversity, threats to biodiversity, priorities for conservation, and approaches to conservation. Twenty-two essays by such notables as Tony Witten, John Seidensticker, Jason Clay, John Robinson, Judy Mills, and Kathy MacKinnon, among others, are interspersed throughout the book. The essays cover a wide range of topics such as limestone biodiversity, tiger protection, direct payments for conservation, and integration of community concerns into conservation actions. The unique feature of this book is the information about the spatial distribution of biodiversity and the potential threats to biodiversity. The volume contains a diverse array of maps showing the distribution of ecoregions, major biomes, and endemic species of selected groups of animals and plants and other aspects of biodiversity. Priorities for conservation are then defined on the basis of spatial data, the uniqueness of habitats and biota, and the vulnerability of habitats to anthropogenic pressures. A notable feature is a section on methods to assess conservation status of ecoregions and biological distinctiveness of ecological communities. Like many others, I love maps. In this book two of my few complaints are that the maps are cluttered with details and that the detailed inlays of the maps are not very clear. I would have preferred fewer but clearer maps. Although the essays constitute a strength of the book, they are often awkwardly placed, which interrupts the flow of the main contents of the volume. Overall, however, this is a great book about an important region of the world. The wealth of materials brought together by the editors and the essay authors will greatly benefit the conservation community in the region. The volume is a part of a series on the major ecoregions of the world and the set, once completed, should find a place on the shelves of most conservation professionals.

",,,,"Because of its extreme isolation and lack of historical connection to a mainland, the Hawaiian Archipelago is thought to have no native nonvolant terrestrial reptiles. Several squamate species have been introduced to the archipelago, likely starting with early Polynesian contact, and increasing as human traffic in the Pacific has amplified. Of the earlier introductions, one species of skink, Cryptoblepharus poecilopleurus, belongs to a genus known for its ability to naturally disperse long distances, even across oceans. The earliest herpetofaunal surveys from Hawai‘i describe the skink as widespread and abundant across the archipelago. A recent phylogenetic analysis reveals substantial haplotype divergence between Hawaiian individuals and other known populations in the Pacific, raising the possibility that this species was an early and natural arrival to the archipelago before human contact. Recent surveys suggest that the species has undergone a dramatic reduction in range across the archipelago, possibly due to the invasion of highly competitive species. Given this information, we aim to further assess the origin of C. poecilopleurus in Hawai‘i, determine its current range, and suggest specific needs for future work. Here, we review the earliest European voyages in the Pacific that are known to have sampled C. poecilopleurus, review literature and museum specimens to develop an understanding of this species’ history in the islands, survey the island of O‘ahu to characterize its current range, and provide preliminary genetic analyses to show the relationship of the Hawai’i populations to the rest of the Pacific.","0030-8870

New research has led to redefine the distribution range of P. angusta, identifying new populations in Spain (Balearic Islands), continental France (Var department), southern Italy (Campania), Sardinia and Greece (Kerkyra Island) and to discover new sites of P. placida on Pantelleria island and of Plagyrona spp. in Zannone island and southern Italy. The specific determination of these and others populations by examination of recent literature from Sardinia, Campania and Calabria, was carried out on a morphometric basis, but, for some populations, the variability of the diagnostic characters and the limited number of available specimens, do not allow a precise assignment. On the other hand, the existence of two distinct species is not evident at all, at least in the Mediterranean countries.

","Esplen, Tyler",,Native plant,,,2019.0,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,"This report examines the presence of exotic and invasive plant species in a small urban park in Esquimalt, British Columbia. Highrock Park is a remnant of unique associated ecosystems of Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga meziesii) forest and Garry oak (Quercus garryana) meadowland of significant cultural, recreational, and ecological importance to southeastern Vancouver Island. Threatened like many urban greenspaces with ecosystem disturbances caused by human encroachment, the park faces a loss of biodiversity caused by the proliferation of invasive plant species. The focus of this project was to inventory the amount of invasive species present within the selected project area and to remove as many species as possible through volunteer-based community participation. Furthermore, the goal of removing invasive species was made in preparation for future native re-vegetation planned by the municipality for its annual ‘Earth Day’ event on April 24th, 2019. Large quantities of English ivy (Hedera helix), Himalayan blackberry (Rubus armeniacus), and Laurel-leaved daphne (Daphne laureola) along with several individuals of English holly (Ilex aquifolium), Scotch broom (Cytisus scoparius), and English hawthorn (Crataegus laevigata) were identified in the project area using the Line Intercept Method in conjunction with terrestrial ecosystem mapping based on British Columbia’s Field Manual for Describing Terrestrial Ecosystems (2nd ed., 2010). A volunteer ‘weed pull’ event was organized for April 13th, 2019 that resulted in seven volunteers working a combined thirty volunteer hours to remove significant amounts of invasive plant species from the study area. Ultimately, the project succeeded in bringing together community members to prepare the project area for potential native re vegetation by municipal staff and grade school volunteers on April 24th, 2019.",,,,,,,,,,,,No,,vancouver island,,,,,0.589790702983737,1,0.35165003222589286,0.6,3,859.0

Between 2007 and 2019, 264 specimens were collected, representing 80 species in 29 genera. Most of these records result from targetted searching during NBM-led biodiversity surveys (the BiotaNB project) in provincial protected natural areas between 2014 and 2019 and a mycological foray on Campobello Island in 2016. Previously, only seven species had been reported for the province. Consistent with their worldwide distributions and abundance, Arcyria cinerea, Fuligo septica, Ceratiomyxa fruticulosa, and Lycogala epidendrum were the most collected species, whereas the globally rare species Paradiacheopsis microcarpa has been collected in New Brunswick six times. Forty-two species were found only once, and five of these (Comatricha mirabilis, Fuligo laevis, Hemitrichia chrysospora, Lepidoderma neoperforatum, Listerella paradoxa) are rare worldwide.

I studied the habitat associations of this subspecies within a coastal sand ecosystem at Cordova Shore on southeast Vancouver Island, British Columbia. Little is known about habitat requirements for this butterfly; however, because of its Endangered status, information on its habitat is required to help direct conservation action. During the summers of 2013 and 2014, I compared habitat conditions at occupied and simultaneously unoccupied sites. I used conditional logistic regression for matched pairs to investigate relationships between butterfly presence and six habitat variables in 21 occupied and 21 random plots and used Akaike information criterion (AIC) to identify the best among a set of 20 candidate models. Most of the butterflies (91%) were observed within the Dune wildrye – Beach pea (Leymus mollis - Lathyrus japonicas) terrestrial ecosystem. The best supported model included black knotweed (Polygonum paronychia) and Oregon gumweed (Grindelia oregonia) as the sole variables predicting the occurrence of Oregon Banded Skipper. The model predicted that the likelihood that Oregon Branded Skipper will be present increases with increases in the cover of Oregon gumweed (OR = 1.5, 95% CI: 0.9-2.6) and black knotweed (OR = 1.6, 95% CI: 0.1-23.6). The two plants are likely important for the Skipper; however, small sample sizes and model confidence intervals suggest a cautionary approach to applying the model.

",,,,"ABSTRACT The shifting climatic regime of maritime Antarctica is driving complex changes across trophic levels that are manifesting differentially across its resident species and regions. Land‐breeding pinnipeds have increased their seasonal attendance near Palmer Station since the earliest observations in the mid‐1900s, and Antarctic fur seals ( Arctocephalus gazella ) now represent a significant but unstudied predator population in the region during the austral summer. To characterize the timing of abundance and the fine‐scale distribution of this seasonal attendance, we carried out regular drone surveys of terrestrial habitats near Palmer Station in the austral summer of 2020. Using repeat animal counts and photogrammetric data products, we modeled fur seal abundance at survey sites over the period of observation, modeled habitat suitability based on fine‐scale topographic habitat characteristics, and estimated abundance across terrestrial habitats near Palmer Station as a function of these products. High habitat suitability was most associated with low‐slope and low‐elevation inshore terrain and with relatively dry, sun‐exposed, and wind‐sheltered locations, and estimated peak abundance occurred on March 11 (day 71) of 2020. Models estimated 2289–5544 (95% confidence interval) fur seals on land across all potential terrestrial habitats (41 discrete sites) near Palmer Station and Wylie Bay on the south coast of Anvers Island during peak abundance. This constitutes a first estimate of the aggregate timing, abundance, and distribution of Antarctic fur seals in the terrestrial habitats of this region—a critical first step in understanding the phenology and ecological role of this largely nonbreeding predator population. These findings additionally establish a baseline from which to estimate future changes in this seasonal population and its effects on sympatric terrestrial and marine biota, as the physical environment and food chain of the western Antarctic Peninsula transform under long‐term climatic changes.

Along with members of Cave Conservancy of Hawai’i, we surveyed 24 lava tube sections on the drier, western side of the Big Island, primarily in Hawaiian Ocean View Estates in the Ka’ū District. Surveys occurred during late November and early December of 2015–2017. Species present in each cave were documented by observation and limited collections of specimens for identification purposes. Significant species were discovered in these caves, representing new locations for rare and limited species previously documented from different regions on the island, and/or new, undescribed species from significant lineages that are federally listed on other islands. The most significant species observed included a reduviid thread-legged bug ( Nesidiolestes sp.), a terrestrial amphipod ( Spelaeorchestia sp.), a microvellid ( Cavaticovelia sp.), and a new cave-adapted planthopper ( Oliarus sp.). While identification of the collected specimens is ongoing, documenting these significant species from lava tube caves in Ka’ū District illustrates the need for continued bioinventory work in this area.

",,,,"Earthworms are key organisms in terrestrial ecosystems. They are found globally and provide significant ecological functions and ecosystem services, so their conservation should be a priority. Yet little is known about the large-scale impacts of global change on earthworm diversity, species distribution, and assemblage structure. More importantly, there are no comprehensive data on changes over long periods of time. In the 1960s, Marcel Bouché conducted a study by sampling earthworm assemblages in 1399 locations in mainland France, including the island of Corsica. Through the #Vers2022 project, we achieved the resampling of 418 of these historical sites, creating the first dataset to assess the long-term changes in earthworm assemblages at a large scale. This dataset includes Bouché (1972) assemblage data, with original taxon's names, absence data, and site descriptions, published in 1972 in French, which were still not freely accessible in a standardized, computerized format. It consists of 36,079 individual earthworm records from 1399 sites, documenting 127 species and subspecies between 1961 and 1970. Additionally, it provides the results of the #Vers2022 resurvey, which includes 11,137 individual records (22,344 including unidentified) from 418 resampled sites, documenting 122 species and subspecies between 2019 and 2023. We followed the framework of quasi-permanent plots, ensuring that the environment was as similar as possible between the historical sampling and its current resampling. These sites were sampled using a standardized, reproducible, and quantitative protocol, unlike the historical sampling, which was qualitative. The dataset also includes information on the individual body mass of each specimen, the total earthworm biomass of each assemblage, and soil analysis data. Furthermore, this work presents the updated taxonomy of each taxon provided by Bouché, along with an assessment of each species name in view of current taxonomy, as well as proposed names for future studies utilizing these data. The #Vers2022 dataset represents a significant improvement in our understanding of French earthworm diversity and can be used to assess changes in diversity and assemblages over a span of more than 50 years, including patterns in individual body mass.

The Maritime Antarctic is one of the areas of the globe currently experiencing rapid regional climate change. The effects of this rapid regional change on the terrestrial and marine ecosystems have been in the focus of the National Antarctic Research Programs in recent years. Increased knowledge on the status of terrestrial and marine ecosystems of Maritime Antarctic will help us to better understand the effects of global changes on the ecosystem, to effectively conserve and manage them, and to develop more scenarios of its future state. Advances in Polar Science publishes this special issue focusing on “Current Status of the Terrestrial and Marine Ecosystems of Maritime Antarctic (TMEMA)”, to provide an international forum to summarize the recent advances in this important topic. This special issue TMEMA is based on submissions from scientists of Argentina, China, Germany, Chile, Uruguay, USA and Venezuela, altogether 18 manuscripts, 14 articles of which were adopted before the acceptance deadline and released as expected. These papers involve the following topics: (1) Assessment of trace metals in droppings of Adélie penguins from different locations of the Antarctic Peninsula area; (2) Geographic ranges of ascidians from Antarctica and the southeastern Pacific; (3) Experimental culture of non-indigenous Juncus bufonius from King George island; (4) Detection of integron integrase genes on King George Island; (5) Distribution patterns of typical enzyme activities in tundra soils on Fildes Peninsula; (6) Analysis of phosphorus forms in sediment cores from ephemeral ponds on Ardley Island; (7) Sources and distribution of particulate organic carbon in Great Wall Cove and Ardley Cove; (8) Distributions of Seawater nutrient and chlorophyll a and influencing factors in the seawaters nearby distributions near Chinese Antarctic Great Wall Station; (9) Preliminary evidence for 17 coastal terraces in Fildes peninsula; (10) Characterizing proteases in an Antarctic Janthinobacterium sp.

",,,,,,"Orchidaceae is widely distributed on Earth with major distribution in the tropical regions, including Indonesia. Seram Island located in Maluku Province Indonesia has a high potential to become a habitat for various species of Australasian orchids. Orchid diversity tends to be related to altitude variations in the area that indirectly contribute to creating microclimate variations. One area on Seram Island with various variations in altitude is Mount Binaiya within the Manusela National Park area. This study aims to identify orchid species found on Mount Binaiya. The exploration method was used on the northern trekking route of Mount Binaiya, divided into Waisamata, Kanikeh, Waiansela, and Waihuhu areas. Based on the result, 47 species of orchids were obtained, which belong to the subfamilies Epidendroideae (35 species), Orchidoideae (11 species), and Vanilloideae (1 species). Based on the life form, 25 species were epiphytes, while 22 species were terrestrial orchids. Waisamata had the highest number of species (23 species), followed by Waiansela (14 species), Waihuhu (14 species), and Kanikeh (8 species). Of all these species, some that need further research are Corybas spp., Cyrtosia nana, Pterostylis papuana, Glomera papuana, and Mediocalcar pygmaeum. Some species are new records in their distribution or rediscoveries of existing records.

",,,,"The organizers of this symposium and the speakers this morning are to be congratulated on having given so prominent a place to the flora in this discussion of the terrestrial zoology of the southern cold temperate zone. Many terrestrial animals (this is especially true of insects) are confined to places where certain plants occur; on their part, animals in various ways influence the distribution and abundance of some plants. In fact, the terrestrial fauna and flora are often so interdependent in nature that the separate study of animal ecology and plant ecology in classrooms has long seemed to me regrettable. Marine biologists recog­nized this long ago, and deal with phytoplankton and zooplankton together as a matter of course. I look forward to the time when we shall teach the ecology of plants and animals together as, in nature, we must study them. Problems such as the source of the fauna of Gough Island and the relationships of animals found in different parts of the southern temperate zone seem to me to demand more for their solution than merely the comparison of museum specimens, and it was encouraging to hear from Dr Holdgate that other methods will be tried. J. A. Muldrew has written of two strains of Pristiphora erichsonii in Manitoba which appear to differ only in that the blood of one of them reacts to a particular parasite. The reaction does not occur in European Pristiphora and it may be that the two strains in Manitoba have different origins, one in America, the other in Europe. Such subtle differences between living animals, revealed by the methods of serology, genetics, ecology or ethology, might provide important and even decisive information about the sources and relationships of the island faunas.","0080-4649

These organisms are of keen interest in investigations comprising a variety of topics, including animal evolution, biogeography, and conservation, given their close affinities with the arthropods and remarkable distribution pattern, as well as the point-endemism of almost all species. Onychophorans are found in moist habitats in tropical and subtropical forests, but given their nocturnal activity and cryptic behavior, relatively little is known about the biology and conservation status of the ~200 valid described species. Onychophorans are subdivided into 2 major subgroups: the Peripatidae (81 species) inhabiting the Neotropics (= Neopatida), equatorial Africa, and Southeast Asia, and the Peripatopsidae (120 species) occurring in the Australasian region, Chile, and southern Africa. The Caribbean islands house 22 described species of Peripatidae—over 25% of the diversity known for this subgroup. Only 3 species are of recognized conservation concern and included on the International Union for Conservation of Nature Red List: Macroperipatus insularis (endangered), Plicatoperipatus jamaicensis (lower risk/near threatened), and Speleoperipatus spelaeus (critically endangered). The restricted geographic ranges of onychophoran species, together with their occurrence in insular habitats subject to natural and/or anthropogenic disturbance, suggest that onychophorans might be at risk in the Caribbean islands.

There is an increasing need for waste management, given the rising population density and the associated increase in waste production. This waste can take the form of human waste (sewage sludge) and livestock waste (animal manure). The primary means of adding value to this waste would be to use it as organic fertiliser in agroecosystems. Sugarcane is the most abundant crop on the island - 54 % of the 43 000 hectares allocated as agricultural land, across 9272 farms. Recycling agricultural waste can be a means of improving the economic sustainability of sugarcane plantations, as local products are recycled and the quantity of fertiliser imported is reduced. This in turn promotes a circular economy on the island. Nitrogen (N) is an essential nutrient for crop growth and development, and is frequently a limiting factor in sugarcane agroecosystems. Despite the clear benefits of N fertilisers in contributing to adequate crop nutrition, excessive amounts accumulated in terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems can lead to a significant impact on environmental quality, ecosystems, biodiversity and human health. Environmental impacts linked to the N cycle include the loss of N to the atmosphere in the form of NH3 during the process of volatilization and in the form of the greenhouse gas N2O during the process of nitrification and denitrification. Excess N is lost via leaching in the form of nitrates, which can lead to negative impacts on freshwater ecosystems. Here we present the findings of one-complete-year monitoring of nitrogen fluxes (N uptake, N2O and NO3) in sugarcane plots fertilized with liquid pig manure and sewage sludge as compared with the use of urea fertiliser. The study is being conducted on Reunion Island in a long-term monitoring field trial site belonging to the SOERE-PRO network, where the objective is to observe the effects of organic residue application on the different 'compartments' of a sugarcane agroecosystem. The contribution of organic residues to N sugarcane (nitrogen recovery efficiency) was assessed on a monthly basis using 15N labelling, dilution curves, cane inventories (height and basal diameter) and allometric relationships. The annual flux of N2O was estimated for the different treatments using 12 automatic chambers linked to a gas analyser. These semi- continuous measures allowed the temporal variability of N2O emissions to be studied, in the original context of organic residue application in tropical conditions.

",,,,"Abstract Investigations on resource use by predators are important for understanding the mechanisms of biological coexistence. Although time, habitat, and diet are considered the three major dimensions for niche partitioning, studies that comprehensively investigate these dimensions in predator guilds are limited. Snakes are one of the predators whose populations have been reported to be declining worldwide. While diet has been considered as a fundamental variable that allows snakes to coexist, the importance of spatiotemporal resources has also been noted especially in temperate regions. To clarify the coexistence mechanisms of terrestrial snakes, we assessed the niche partitioning patterns of snakes on Sado Island, a Japanese island rich in snake species, from the perspectives of spatiotemporal and dietary resources. Specifically, we investigated the daily and seasonal occurrences as temporal niches, landscape‐level distribution as a spatial niche, and stomach content as a dietary niche. We found that niche partitioning in all three major resources occurred among snake species on the island. Daily occurrence was partitioned into three groups: completely diurnal, nocturnal, and active during both periods. Seasonal occurrence was partitioned into three groups: widely active from spring to autumn, mainly active in summer, and mainly active in autumn. Distribution was partitioned into two groups: mainly distributed in lowlands and distributed even in mountainous areas. Food habits were partitioned into three groups: rodents, frogs, and earthworms as main prey, respectively. Our results provide empirical evidence that snakes can coexist through multidimensional niche partitioning, and that spatiotemporal resources are also an important force in terrestrial snake coexistence. Furthermore, we suggest that snakes on the island coexist through subtle differences along the three major niche axes, and that conservation of a variety of niches, rather than a single niche, will increase the species diversity of local snakes.

",,,,"Abstract Recent studies on oestroidean Diptera (Brachycera) are providing a comprehensive and nuanced understanding of the evolutionary history of this remarkably diverse clade of holometabolous insects. The Oestroidea, which includes formidable pests such as various blowflies, botflies, and flesh flies that infest livestock, pets and humans, are mostly composed of beneficial species that act as scavengers or parasitoids on various pest insects. In our research, we used genomic methods to elucidate the phylogenetic position of Nesodexia corsicana Villeneuve, 1911 (Diptera: Calliphoridae), a mysterious oestroid species endemic to Corsica and characterized by distinctive morphological features that have puzzled taxonomists for years. Contrary to initial hypotheses, our results place Nesodexia Villeneuve, 1911 within the Calliphoridae subfamily Rhinophorinae, a small lineage of terrestrial isopod parasitoids. Through detailed morphological analysis of adults of both sexes and eggs, we uncovered significant insights consistent with our phylogenomic reconstruction. The unique morphological features of the species, coupled with its restricted and fragmented habitat, highlight its potential conservation importance. We delineated the area of occupancy for N. corsicana and assessed its “threatened” category using specific IUCN Red List criteria. In addition, we mapped the available habitat within its range and determined potential key biodiversity areas (KBA) triggered by N. corsicana. New potential KBAs are only partially covered by the Corsican Regional Park. Finally, we mapped the distribution of habitats on the island to assess the potential distribution of the species beyond its currently known geographic range.

","Gelling, Lea",,Subspecies,,,2016.0,,,57,68,,,,,,112,,,,,,,,"Oregon Branded Skipper (Hesperia colorado oregonia Edwards), is an Endangered butterfly extant at 6 remaining sites on Vancouver Island, British Columbia. I studied the habitat associations of this subspecies within a coastal sand ecosystem at Cordova Shore on southeast Vancouver Island, British Columbia. Little is known about habitat requirements for this butterfly; however, because of its Endangered status, information on its habitat is required to help direct conservation action. During the summers of 2013 and 2014, I compared habitat conditions at occupied and simultaneously unoccupied sites. I used conditional logistic regression for matched pairs to investigate relationships between butterfly presence and six habitat variables in 21 occupied and 21 random plots and used Akaike information criterion (AIC) to identify the best among a set of 20 candidate models. Most of the butterflies (91%) were observed within the Dune wildrye – Beach pea (Leymus mollis - Lathyrus japonicas) terrestrial ecosystem. The best supported model included black knotweed (Polygonum paronychia) and Oregon gumweed (Grindelia oregonia) as the sole variables predicting the occurrence of Oregon Banded Skipper. The model predicted that the likelihood that Oregon Branded Skipper will be present increases with increases in the cover of Oregon gumweed (OR = 1.5, 95% CI: 0.9-2.6) and black knotweed (OR = 1.6, 95% CI: 0.1-23.6). The two plants are likely important for the Skipper; however, small sample sizes and model confidence intervals suggest a cautionary approach to applying the model.

",,,,"Abstract Interspecific interactions play an important role in structuring wildlife communities. On islands, which often have reduced species assemblages, species may expand their niches resulting in unusual patterns of interactions with other members of the ecological community. In this study, we compared spatio‐temporal interactions of two food competitors between a site with predators and two predator‐free islands in the Coiba archipelago, Panama. Here, capuchin monkeys ( Cebus capucinus imitator ) exhibit high levels of terrestriality, and some groups engage in stone tool use. This potentially leads to competition with sympatric agoutis ( Dasyprocta coibae ), which have overlapping diets. We used camera‐trap surveys to estimate temporal overlap between both species, distinguishing between arboreal and terrestrial activity of capuchins. We also compared detection rates and intervals between consecutive detections of both species at sites in which the monkeys use stone tools (tool‐use area) and sites in which they do not (non‐tool‐use area). We found high spatio‐temporal overlap between agouti and capuchin on the forest floor of both islands. While capuchins visited the tool‐use area four times as often as the non‐tool‐use area, agoutis avoided the tool‐use area, capture rates being 25 times as low. Waiting times were shorter for both species at the tool‐use area. These results suggest temporal overlap and spatial segregation. Niche expansions on islands thus cause unique interactions that do not occur on the mainland. Abstract in Spanish is available with online material.

",,,,"Abstract Mangroves, as one of the important blue carbon ecosystems, store large amounts of organic carbon. In the last decades, carbon stock assessment in mangrove ecosystems has been increased intensely following international agreements targeted at reducing global carbon emission. Many studies have investigated carbon stock potential in mangrove ecosystems, however, little is known about carbon stocks of mangroves growing in carbonate setting in small islands. These marine mangroves usually receive little or no terrestrial input, thus may have limited nutrient availability to support their growth. Meanwhile, their contribution to a global carbon inventory cannot be neglected. Here, we assessed biomass carbon stock of marine mangroves in Kepulauan Seribu, Jakarta, by using published allometric equations. Data collection was conducted in seven small islands; Burung Island, Kongsi Island, Pari Island, Lancang Besar Island, Lancang Kecil Island, Pramuka Island, and Rambut Island. The total average aboveground carbon stock was 46.68 Mg C ha −1 , with Rhizopora sp. as the dominant species. The highest carbon stock was measured in Pari Island (72.1 ± 30.4 C ha −1 ), followed by Lancang Kecil Island (62.4 ± 38.6 Mg C ha −1 ), Kongsi Island (54.1 ± 27.0 Mg C ha −1 ), Rambut Island (52.1 ± 21.6 Mg C ha- 1 ), Burung Island (47.9 ± 21.0 Mg C ha −1 ), Lancang Besar Island (31.3 ± 13.8 Mg C ha −1 ), and the lowest was in Pramuka Island (6.8 ± 4.8 Mg C ha- 1 ). Mangrove aboveground carbon in these islands were comparable to those in other areas. Having thousands of small islands, Indonesia thus has a significant contribution to global climate change mitigation.

",,,,"Jesamine Bartlett—University of Birmingham & British Antarctic Survey. Since the 1960, our attitudes to both gender and biosecurity have shifted somewhat: The British Antarctic Survey (BAS) now has a woman at the helm in Professor Jane Francis, and we are rapidly learning how even the smallest of invasive species can impact ecosystems, with the movement of soil and non-native species rapidly rising up the agenda for Antarctic Treaty member states. I find the story of how John's and my paths intertwined via one experiment interesting because of this. It highlights some huge changes within society and science over the last 50 years. As part of an effort by BAS to understand life at the Poles, John Edwards had transplanted plants from South Georgia Island in the sub-Antarctic to Signy Island in the Antarctic (1973, British Antarctic Survey Bulletin, 33: 33–45). But it took nearly 20 years for anyone to realize that the midge, Eretmoptera murphyi, had hitched a ride in the plants and taken up residence on Signy Island. By then, it was too late to try and remove it: its soil-dwelling larvae were living within the peat and moss banks on the island, which are some of the best examples of this habitat in the Southern Ocean. Eradication of the midge would have meant significant harm to the vegetation. In any case, you only need to miss one larva for the eradication effort to have been for nothing, as the midge is asexual. And with pre-existing adaptations to the cold, it was thus primed to be a successful invader. Since its discovery, the midge has spread, and a recent survey from my trip to Antarctica found that it now covers an area of almost 1 km2, which is impressive for a flightless midge that has an active season of just a few months each year. Since its establishment, the midge is now the largest terrestrial animal on Signy Island, with native terrestrial fauna represented by a few collembola and mite species. The island ecosystem is simple, and as a result, we are learning a lot about the impact that a single species introduction can have in Antarctica: We are finding that larvae are so abundant in places that they are affecting soil chemistry, adding as much nitrogen as is seen in areas in and around seal colonies. The success of E. murphyi on Signy marks it out as the most successful and persistent introduced invertebrate to Antarctica. Today, we are using this accidental introduction to highlight the impact of soil transfer in the Antarctic, supporting BAS's efforts to tighten policy and biosecurity measures. The irony of this story now is that we fear another invasive species may have wiped out E. murphyi in its native range. Now the Signy population may be the only one left. Should we consider conserving the alien?! John Edwards In the 1960’s, Ann Holtom was studying the two native Antarctic flowering plants at Winterbourne Gardens, University of Birmingham. In those days, BAS did not allow women to “go south,” so she studied herbarium specimens alongside living material brought from Antarctica by others. I was then a young undergraduate studying microbes at Aberystwyth University but ended up extending her Antarctic research on Signy in the South Orkney Islands. Fortune played a large part as my external examiner, Professor Fogg, had spent 1966 “south” with BAS, and he subsequently contacted Dr Stanley Greene about me. Within a few days of graduating, I received a telegram saying “PHONE GREENE POLAR SURVEY IMMEDIATELY.” Ann's bad luck of being female in the pre-enlightened era was my good fortune, and I became contracted to BAS at the University of Birmingham. My 21st birthday was spent sailing out of the Falkland Is. into the teeth of a force 8 gale, spending three summers and a winter on scenic Signy Island in the maritime Antarctic. I monitored the growth and reproduction of native angiosperms, trying to discover what special features, if any, they possessed that enabled them and no others, to successfully establish in Antarctica. We wondered whether it might be the physical barrier presented by the Southern Ocean that prevented other species from growing there, so Stanley took some endemic Falkland plants to test whether they could survive on South Georgia. He suggested I do the same, taking some additional species from sub-Antarctic South Georgia to Signy. These transplant experiments were carefully monitored to ensure no plant species established, and any plants surviving when the monitoring period ended were removed and burned. Perhaps fortuitously, the climate—especially the frequent frosts during the growing season—proved too harsh for all but a few of the transplanted species. My research suggested that Antarctica's only two native angiosperms Deschampsia antarctica and Colobanthus quitensis did indeed possess special eco-physiological features, having relatively low-temperature optima for photosynthesis of around 14°C. However, although not a single botanical transplant became established, the same cannot be said for animals inadvertently imported during my experiment. I failed to notice any minute creatures in the soil the plants came with, but there seems little doubt that at least two invertebrate species traveled among the South Georgian plants: In the 1980’s, scientists on Signy recorded an annelid and a flightless midge in the area used for my transplants which had not been reported elsewhere in Antarctica. But my “bad luck” in inadvertently introducing aliens became Jesamine's PhD. She was able to carry out research on the midge Eretmoptera murphyi, incidentally also at the University of Birmingham and, unlike my predecessor, she was able to spend a summer studying on Signy Island, almost 50 years after I was there. She tells me an invasive beetle has been decimating invertebrate life on South Georgia and that E. murphyi hasn't been seen there for years, so maybe I've accidentally saved this species from extinction!

Columbia. Galiano is a sparsely inhabited island and is host to a vast selection of different
ecosystems. This island is home to the Galiano Conservancy Association, an organization that
oversees an array of protected land areas and trusts, on top of operating their flagship property,
the Millard Learning Centre. At over 180 acres, the Millard Learning Centre presents a
confluence of educational programming and ecosystem restoration. There are many restoration
projects on the property that are completed, ongoing, or planned for the future.
This report outlines a recently completed project that melds a more traditional ecosystem
restoration with the creation of a designed ecosystem. Ultimately, we aimed to restore an area
of Coastal Douglas-fir forest and to create a pocket wetland. The project site will also serve as an
outdoor classroom of sorts, as the site is directly adjacent to the conservancy’s classroom
building.
The primary goals of this project were to: restore an area of degraded Coastal Douglas-fir
forest that had been previously logged in the 1990s, expand the available wetland habitat on the
Millard Learning Centre property, and to provide easy-access wetland viewing for educational
purposes.
The planning process included surveying the site through GIS mapping, transit elevations
surveys, and soil pit analysis. Based on this information, designs were created. These included
the placement of the wetland, the excavation plan of the wetland, and the plant communities
that would make up the terrestrial aspect of the restoration.
Several iterations of the design were considered, and we ultimately ended up where we
are now through the collaboration of many brilliant and hard-working individuals. Land was
excavated to create the wetland basin, the liner was installed, habitat features were placed, and
the surrounding area was seeded and planted.
This project was completed in October of 2020, and at the time of this writing, the wetland is

Afonso1* 1 MARE – Marine and Environmental Sciences Centre, ESTM, Instituto Politécnico de Leiria, Portugal The Berlengas archipelago is located in the Atlantic Ocean, on the Portuguese continental shelf, on the western side of Iberian Peninsula, close to Cape Carvoeiro (Peniche). It distances approximately 5.7 miles from mainland. It is a protected area since 1981. In 2011 Berlengas’ became part of the list of patrimony of UNESCO, aiming to conserve representative terrestrial and marine ecosystems of the Portuguese coast. As a result to insular isolation, and to very difficult climatic and edaphic conditions, terrestrial flora evolved differently from the species of mainland. In fact, these plants struggle to survive with extreme dryness, very little soil, strong winds and large amounts of salt. These harsh conditions lead to speciation process that differentiated three endemic species, of great conservation value: Armeria berlengensis, Herniaria lusitanica subsp. berlengiana and Pulicaria microcephala. P. microcephala, as well as A. berlengensis, is registered in Annex II of the Habitats Directive, due to its conservation relevance, and is considered vulnerable. The aim of this project, therefore, was to multiply, in vitro, the species P. microcephala. Plant shoots were collected in the autumn 2015 from a natural wild population in the Berlengas Island. Shoots were obtained from different mother plants in similar maturation stages, trying to interfere the least with the natural propagation process in the protected area. The material was sterilized by soaking in a bleach solution, and after that with ethanol. Shoots were then rinsed four times in sterile distilled water and placed initially on culture tubes with Murashige and Skoog (MS) mineral formulation (Sigma) supplemented with 0.3% (w/v) sucrose and 0.2% (w/v) gelrite (Sigma, Germany). After the end of the first week, the contaminated culture tubes were discarded. Culture tubes were maintained in a growth chamber with a 16h-light photoperiod under cool, white ﬂuorescent lamps (60 µmol.m−2.s−1), at a temperature of 23ºC. Shoots were subcultured in fresh medium every 4 weeks. For the assessment of the multiplication rates, shoots with 2-4 cm high were selected as explants, from stocks maintained in establishment medium. The medium used at this stage contained MS mineral salts, 3% (w/v) sucrose, 1ml.L-1 Gamborg vitamin formulation (Sigma), 1.5% (w/v) Phytoagar and different growth regulators. Plant growth regulators tested included various concentrations of cytokinins (BA, KIN), singly or in combination with auxin (NAA, IAA, IBA). The same basal medium was also used as control, without the addition of any growth regulators. This constitutes the basis for the establishment of the full process of micropropagation of this species. The establishment of adequate micropropagation methods may constitute a valuable route for the conservation of this threatened species, and contribute in a near future to the recovery of this species in its natural habitats.

Allard2 1SciWrite Environmental Sciences Ltd., Canada 2Azimuth Consulting Group Inc., Canada 3Fisheries and Oceans - Canadian Coast Guard, Canada Abstract The Canadian Coast Guard is assessing the potential environmental impacts of contamination at 27 remote lightstations on the British Columbia coast. British Columbia has about 25,000 km of shoreline including thousands of islands, most of which are accessible only by boat or helicopter. The lightstations, which have been in use for up to 140 years, essentially consist of industrial installations maintained by resident lightkeepers in settings of otherwise pristine coastal wilderness. The region is a hotspot of biological diversity. Previous studies had shown that heavy metals and petroleum hydrocarbon concentrations in surface soils exceeded provincial and federal environmental standards and guidelines at these stations. Contaminant sources include the historical use, degradation and dispersion of heavy metals based paints, waste dumping and incineration, and bulk petroleum hydrocarbon storage and transfer. This paper presents a study used for assessing potential impacts to endangered species and habitat elements from direct (contact) and indirect (food chain) exposure to the environmental contamination. An initial search of endangered species and habitat element records identified over 300 occurrences in marine and terrestrial environments among the sites. Variability in the extent and magnitude of contamination, anticipated transport and fate of contamination, and the distribution of sensitive receiving environments, including the presence of rare species, provided a basis to prioritise 14 lightstations for field study. The subsequent field investigations consisted of a qualitative habitat survey and collection of environmental samples of relevant exposure media (e.g., soil, plant tissue, soil invertebrate tissue, groundwater, surface water, and mussel tissue) for chemical analysis. Measured concentrations in exposure media were then input into a food chain",,,,,,"https://doi.org/10.2495/cenv020071

BOOK REVIEW New Survey of Clare Island Volume 6: The Freshwater and Terrestrial Algae Edited by M.D. Guiry, D.M. John, F. Rindi and T.K. McCarthy (Dublin: Royal Irish Academy, 2007; 268pp; 40 paperback) ISBN 978-1-904890-31-7 This is a handsome volume, well illustrated and lovingly collated from the work of several noted authorities in the field of cryptogamic botany. It retraces the steps of the Edwardian giants William West and his son, George, who, somewhat reluctantly it seems, joined the host of international scholars carrying out the first Clare Island Survey. Their reluctance sprang from ill health and the scale of the task they were being asked to undertake. According to the introduction, William wrote to Robert Lloyd Praeger stating that he had already spent considerably more than one thousand hours examining the Clare Island samples! One thousand hours, if to be taken literally, is about half a working year. No doubt the researchers involved in the New Survey of Clare Island have spent an equally impressive amount of time and effort in their work. This is one reason why, as Professor Guiry laments in the preface, we lack native expertise in freshwater algal biodiversity in Ireland. Not alone is it painstaking and time consuming work to identify the many species that might be encountered, there is also a long apprenticeship in becoming acquainted with these fascinating and beautiful organisms. One of the attractions of this volume is the care that has been taken in providing excellent photographs and line drawings to illustrate the species lists. Many of the line drawings by David Williamson are, I think, new, while others are reproduced from The freshwater algal flora of the British Isles 0ohn et al. 2002). The book is divided into twelve chapters, with introductory chapters by David John detailing methods and setting the scene for a series of systematic accounts by the respective specialists in some of the most important groups. Desmids are described by Williamson, stoneworts by Jenny Bryant, the green algae by John, diatoms by Patricia Sims, blue-green algae by Brian Whitton and subaerial algae by Fabio Rindi and Michael Guiry. It is clear from the summary table at the end of this work that there are other groups that have not been given detailed treatment, and it is probable also that the more than 800 species enumerated would be added to if there were specialists available to examine the lesser-known groups. Any attempt to compare the modern results with those from the past is fraught with difficulty. Among the many problems are differences in sampling, the well-known small-scale variation in algal occurrence, the problem of seasonal periodicity, and natural fluctuation between years. The authors are, therefore, wise enough to eschew any claims that changes are of widespread significance or that they can be attributed to global warming, but the main conclusions from this most worthwhile endeavour are clear. Firstly, Clare Island is a jewel of biodiversity, worthy of careful stewardship. Secondly, we should take care to pass on the treasure house of taxonomic knowledge so painstakingly acquired in previous generations. Thirdly, we should pay tribute to the enthusiasm and commitment of the authors of this work and companion volumes of the second Clare Island Survey. It is certain that the scientists did not undertake the work for monetary reward, nevertheless, money was required, and so credit must also go to those who encouraged and sponsored them. Clare Island, such an entrancing prospect from James Wyatt's beautiful town of Westport, has an attraction to anyone who loves the west of Ireland. In preparing this review I also chanced upon a pleasing collection of poems by Sean Lysaght (Lysaght 1991), which spins a light web over a number of the birds mentioned in the original Clare Island Survey. The Clare Island Survey of the early twentieth century continues to resonate in the twenty-first century, producing new data and forming a lens through which to view our natural heritage.

",,,,"Ghosts of Gondwana: the History of Life in New Zealand. Gibbs, G. 2017. Putton & Burton, Nelson, New Zealand. 367 pp. NZ$59.99 (hardcover). ISBN 978-0-947503086. Jared Diamond commented that “New Zealand is as close as we will get to the opportunity to study life on another planet” (Diamond 1990). Thanks to its long geographical isolation, New Zealand has an incredibly high rate of endemism, and the absence of native terrestrial mammals created the conditions to explore new ecological opportunities. Unsurprisingly, New Zealand has captured the attention of biogeographers since James Cook's Endeavour expedition and has deserved the attention of conservation biologists as one of the 25 hotspots of global biodiversity (Myers et al. 2000). The author, George Gibbs, is an entomologist and a former lecturer in biology at Victoria University in Wellington, New Zealand. As an entomologist myself I may be biased, but I think the reader should be glad that the author's background allows him to provide examples from the arthropod world. New Zealand's vertebrate fauna is surely spectacular, but also relatively well-known compared with the equally interesting invertebrate fauna. In comparison to the previous edition, published a decade ago (Gibbs 2006), this edition is 135 pages longer. Taxonomic names were updated (and listed at the end of the book), new publications integrated into the text, and new chapters, figures, and photos were added. Having read both editions, I must say that this one is considerably improved, especially the second half, which is where most of the changes were made. The author's core aim is unchanged: to discuss 2 nonexclusive hypotheses about the origin of New Zealand's biodiversity. Did the living species originate very long ago from Gondwanan ancestors (the vicariance hypothesis [Giribet & Boyer 2010]) or from more recent arrivals that dispersed from nearby lands (dispersion hypothesis [e.g., De Queiroz 2005])? The book has 4 sections. Section 1 introduces the incredible biodiversity of New Zealand. I was impressed to learn that New Zealand has >20,000 endemic invertebrate species and 3 endemic vertebrate orders (chapter 1), and to read about the astonishing lifestyles of the kakapo (Strigops habroptilus) and of the short-tailed bat, pekapeka (Mystacina tuberculata), the latter being 1 of the 2 species of native mammals in New Zealand (chapter 2). These examples well illustrate the peculiar adaptations to the mammal-free island conditions; the kakapo is a flightless, solitary nocturnal parrot with a fascinating lekking behavior, and the pekapeka, while able to fly, is a ground forager. Section 2 focuses on the methodology of historical biogeography. Each of the biogeographer's tools is described in a separate chapter. Chapter 3 outlines the contributions by Wallace, Darwin, Hooker, and Croizat and describes the processes of dispersal, vicariance, and extinction. This chapter is followed by a discussion of the transformation of Gondwana (chapter 4) and the contribution of fossils, in particular prehistoric pollen grains, to our understanding of this process (chapter 5). Chapter 6 introduces the use of phylogenetic trees and of the molecular clock, and this section ends with a discussion on the importance of stepping stones in dispersal (chapter 7); this last chapter is a beautiful addition to the first edition. Section 3 lists factors that have shaped New Zealand's biodiversity: the geological transformations between the Cretaceous and the Pleistocene (chapter 8), extinctions (chapter 9), Oligocene drowning (chapter 10), vicariance (chapter 11), dispersal (chapter 12), formation of the Southern Alps (chapter 14), impact of cold periods during the Pleistocene (chapter 15), and how the arrival of humans abruptly ended the mammal-free island “evolutionary experiment” (chapter 16). I particularly liked the chapter on the Oligocene drowning, a period approximately 23 MYA, when New Zealand was reduced to an archipelago of about the size of New Caledonia today. Gibbs updated this chapter with recent findings (Conran et al. 2014), which—he argues—will finally put to rest the idea of a total submergence of New Zealand. Chapter 13 presents the state of art of the phylogenesis of the jaw-moths (Micropterigidae), the most ancient group of Lepidotera. Although I found it very interesting, I think it would have been better placed in another section because it essentially highlights a vicariant origin of this family of worldwide distribution. Section 4 includes several case studies of the unique biodiversity of New Zealand (chapters 17–23): the fabulous moa and the divaricating plants on which they presumably fed, cicadas, recognizable only by their different songs, a particular, even if not species-rich herpetofauna composed of ancient and recent arrivals, the dull-coloured flora, predatory snails and slugs, and the freshwater fauna (molluscs, crustaceans and the caddisflies, mayflies, and stoneflies among insects), which may constitute the best support for the vicariance hypothesis. You may agree or not that the origin of New Zealand fauna is best explained by vicariance or by dispersion, and among the chapters Gibbs offers a number of examples in support of both (although from the title we can guess on which side the author sympathies lie). Nevertheless, I believe the main focus of the book is the origin of biodiversity in New Zealand, which mostly depends on current knowledge (I am looking forward to the next edition with further updates). The book is intended for the public and anyone who has an interest in New Zealand flora and fauna. Many figures and photos (>150 altogether) of good quality make the reading easier and understandable. What makes it an excellent textbook for students interested in biogeography, and a very pleasant read, is that by using the case of New Zealand, the author presents the complexity of the work of biogeographers, who have to rely on every possible source of information and to always be ready to challenge established theories. Even if indirectly, this book is also a forceful reminder of why we should do all we can to preserve biodiversity in New Zealand as everywhere else on Earth.

",,,,"Leptodactylus fallax, commonly known as the mountain chicken frog, is a large terrestrial frog currently found on two islands in the Caribbean. Habitat destruction, overhunting and disease outbreaks have contributed to declining population numbers. In order to identify appropriate conservation strategies, the historic geographic distribution of this frog must first be determined. Because no archeological evidence exists, this was accomplished by reviewing historical documents and inspecting museum collections. Inaccuracies in location and species names were identified in documents as well as in the mislabeling of museum specimens. Two means for natural immigration (dispersal and vicariance) and the artificial introduction by humans were considered. The authors concluded that the Amerindians transported L. fallax to eight islands throughout the Lesser Antilles as potential food resources as they colonized this area. The implication that 75% of the historical distribution is currently unoccupied by this species is considered in light of future reintroduction projects. ","2141-243X

",,,,,,"The majority of vulnerability assessments of biodiversity to global changes have so far been applied to, and designed for, mainland systems, overlooking islands. However, islands harbour unique biodiversity and are epicentres of ongoing extinctions. We thus introduce a specific framework for quantifying the vulnerability of terrestrial insular biota to multiple threats. This framework uses markers of exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity to account for the unique characteristics of island biodiversity. Our assessment framework involves five steps: (1) defining the scope of the vulnerability assessment, (2) selecting the most appropriate markers, (3) computing the vulnerability metric, (4) evaluating uncertainties, and (5) providing recommendations for conservation. The development of this vulnerability framework tailored for island systems is part of a larger initiative to meet international policy targets that better integrate biodiversity threats and dimensions. We thus discuss the need and urgency for applying this framework to guide evidence-based decisions for the conservation of insular biodiversity, and for increased attention to insular biota at the science-policy interface.

wetland birds constituted a substantial proportion of mink
diet, and greater than that reported in other areas. Many birds

",,,,"Galapagos giant tortoises are the largest terrestrial vertebrates and one of the most iconic species of the Galapagos islands. Their populations continue to be endangered because of multiple factors, mostly driven by anthropogenic activities. In recent years, the presence of novel infectious agents of potential conservation concern, including two adenoviruses and two herpesviruses, has been reported in some Galapagos tortoise species. With the aim of describing the presence and prevalence of these pathogens in additional tortoise species, we collected oral, ocular, and cloacal swabs from 99 free-living tortoises from San Cristobal (Chelonoidis chathamensis) and Isabela islands (Chelonoidis vicina and Chelonoidis guntheri) and screened these for the presence of herpesvirus and adenovirus by PCR. We detected Chelonoidis adenovirus 1 (CheAdV1) and Chelonoidis adenovirus 2 (CheAdV2) in all sampling locations, whereas we did not detect herpesvirus in any tortoises. Phylogenetic analyses revealed that San Cristobal nucleotide and amino acid sequences clustered in a clade with CheAdV1, whereas the Isabela nucleotide and amino acid sequences clustered together with CheAdV2. This contributes additional information regarding tortoise viral distribution in the Galapagos Archipelago. We recommend long-term health surveillance of tortoises and other wildlife species to inform conservation actions in the Galapagos involving captive-breeding and rewilding programs.","0090-3558

Terrestrial gastropods are particularly susceptible to alterations in temperature and humidity and have develop morph-physiological and behavioural adaptations in this regard. Shell colour polymorphism and its potential implication for thermoresistance constitute an unexplored field in Neotropical land snails. The variation in shell colour luminance is characterized in the threatened endemic Eastern Cuban tree snails Polymita picta and Polymita muscarum using digital tools; being able to discriminate shell luminance between colour morphs for both species, under different image-taking conditions. For P . muscarum , the albino morph presented the highest luminance values (152.7 ± 0.4); while the lowest values correspond to the brown morph with dark bands (112.9 ± 0.8). Otherwise, for P . picta , the morphs showing the highest luminance were yellow with a pink sutural band (112.8 ± 7.1) and pale yellow (112.6 ± 10.3) and the lowest luminance corresponded to the black morph (44.5 ± 1.2). The presence of dark bands decreased the luminance values regardless of their position in the shell, the morph and the species analysed. In general, the shells of P . muscarum have higher luminance than those of P . picta . Luminance variations demonstrate the ’indiscrete’ nature of this trait and highlight the complex interactions between evolutionary mechanisms and shell color polymorphism in Polymita . This supports the hypothesis that colour has adaptive value for thermoregulation, encompassing not only the background colour but also the coloration of the bands. The differences in the shell luminance in both species suggest a correlation with the geographical distribution and corresponding habitats. Based on our findings, yellowish morphs will be more resistant to future climatic conditions in their respective habitats on the island.

",,,,"Abstract Managing invasive species is a key element of ecological restoration yet assessing invasion status and determining outcomes of management operations remain logistical and financial challenges, particularly on remote islands. Environmental DNA (eDNA) metabarcoding offers a promising, emerging opportunity for reliable, rapid, and cost‐efficient invasive species monitoring. Here, we tested eDNA as a tool for invasive species monitoring on islands. We collected aquatic eDNA samples from beach and lake sites on three atoll islands with different invasion statuses before and after a rat eradication operation. Two dozen eDNA samples can confirm with ≥95% probability the presence of invasive rats prior to any management intervention. Furthermore, our novel eDNA metabarcoding approach distinguished the presence of two closely related rat species ( Rattus rattus and R. exulans ) between neighboring islands. However, following the eradication operation, neither targeted eDNA nor trail camera monitoring could detect the presence of known surviving animals. Aquatic eDNA monitoring using beach and/or lake sampling offers a competitive alternative in invasive species monitoring to conventional survey tools. Particularly on remote, uninhabited, or difficult to access islands, the possibility to detect terrestrial invasive rats from coastal waters offers a substantial advantage.

The past distribution of this species, assessed by shells collected from archaeological sites, natural deposits or surface surveys, shows it previously had a wider distribution that extended across all the limestone islands of the Guadeloupe archipelago. Stratigraphical contexts and radiocarbon data suggest that the presence or abundance of A. patula is related to periods of wetter environmental or climatic conditions, indicating that environmental factors influenced past variations in the distribution of this species. Its limitation to rare ecological refuges in periods of dry climatic conditions, combined with human-induced landscape modifications, have led to significant reductions in the numbers of individuals of this species that is today threatened with extinction in the Guadeloupe Islands. L'Ambrette capuchon, Amphibulima patula (Bruguière, 1789), est un escargot indigène rare en Guadeloupe, connu en Grande Terre et, historiquement, à Marie-Galante. Les coquilles collectées en site archéologique, en site géologique ou lors de prospections malacologiques, témoignent d'une distribution de ce taxon plus étendue par le passé qu'à l'actuel, couvrant l'ensemble des îles calcaires de l'archipel guadeloupéen. Les données géologiques, stratigraphiques et chronologiques montrent que la présence et l'abondance d'A. patula se corrèlent à l'optimum humide de l'Holocène, ou à un contexte de plaine littorale humide pour les coquilles recueillies dans les dépôts du dernier interglaciaire, suggérant par là-même que les facteurs environnementaux ont contrôlé les variations passées de l'aire de distribution de cette espèce. Une distribution limitée à de rares refuges écologiques en période sèche, combinée à une dégradation humaine des milieux, a conduit à une réduction significative de l'abondance de cet escargot aujourd'hui proche de la disparition en Guadeloupe.

",,,,"Plant invasion affects plant community composition, biodiversity, and nutrient cycling in terrestrial ecosystems, particularly in vulnerable ecosystems. As an invasive parasitic plant, Cassytha filiformis has caused extensive damage to the native vegetation of the Paracel Islands. However, the effects of C. filiformis invasion on litter decomposition and nutrient release in native plant communities remain unclear. We conducted an in-situ decomposition experiment in native plant communities on a coral island to explore the litter decomposition dynamics varying across enzyme activities, soil properties and C. filiformis invasive degrees. The mass loss of litter was determined during the decomposition process. The data showed that litter mass loss under severe invasion was significantly lower than in uninvaded sites after nine months of decomposition. The invasion of C. filiformis accelerated the nitrogen release and lignin decomposition with increased litter quality and polyphenol oxidase activity. Besides, soil phosphorus availability and potassium content also induced the oxidase activity. Meanwhile, the decomposition of litter organic carbon was delayed because β-1, 4-glucosidase activity was low in the first six months. Besides, peroxidase activity maintained a high level in invasive plots, indicating that the residues of C. filiformis may have allelopathy. Our results suggested that the invasion of C. filiformis accelerated litter mass loss and element release on coral islands by regulating litter quality and enzyme activity. However, the short-term rapid litter decomposition may result in nutrient loss, which is not conducive to the growth of native plants.

diatoms, resting cells of P. borealis are tolerant for at least short periods of desiccation,
suggesting that airborne dispersal is possible which may limit opportunities for allopatric
spéciation. Nevertheless, molecular phylogenies based on the plastid gene rbcl and the
nuclear 28S rDNA (D1-D3 region) revealed that P. borealis consists of multiple lineages,
including a distinct continental Antarctic lineage. Ongoing work includes the addition of
isolates from the maritime Antarctic and the (sub)Antarctic Marion Island. A molecular clock
for Pinnularia estimates the age of P. borealis at 35.8 (30-47) million years (Ma), and the
continental Antarctic lineage at 7.8 (2-15) Ma. Compared to the lineages from non-polar
regions, the continental Antarctic lineage of P. borealis has a lower optimal growth
temperature and upper lethal temperature, indicating niche differentiation. The distinct
molecular lineages, the old age of these lineages and the (partial) thermal niche
differentiation suggest that long-distance dispersal is not common enough in P. borealis to

The wide distribution is possibly related to their adaptability to almost all terrestrial habitats from various altitudes, which may lead to a high level of genetic variation. This study aimed to assess the genetic variation and phylogenetic relationship of cogongrass in Java Island using an intergenic spacer (IGS) sequence in the cpDNA genome, i.e. trnT(UGU)-trnL(UAA), as the molecular marker of high mutation rate. Plant samples were collected randomly from five different sites on the island. These were subjected to total genomic DNA extraction. The DNAs obtained were then used as PCR templates to amplify trnT(UGU)-trnL(UAA) IGS using a pair of universal primers. The PCR products were sequenced for genetic analysis. It was shown that an extremely high genetic variation with respect to the haplotype diversity of cogongrass in Java Island was observed. Nevertheless, a very low nucleotide diversity was obtained revealing a considerably close genetic relationship among the samples. Anatomical data regarding stomata number and length were found to correspond to the high level of genetic variation, but it was not the case with the stomata index.

Peatlands (mires) found here are threatened by climate change, yet their distribution factors are poorly understood. This study attempted to predict mire distribution on the PEIs using species distribution models (SDMs) employing multiple regression-based and machine-learning models. The random forest model performed best. Key influencing factors were the Normalized Difference Water Index and slope, with low annual mean temperature, with low annual mean temperature, precipitation seasonality and distance from the coast being less influential. Despite moderate predictive ability, the model could only identify general areas of mires, not specific ones. Therefore, this study showed limited support for the use of SDMs in predicting mire distributions on the sub-Antarctic PEIs.

",,,,"While biological invasions continue to threaten biodiversity, most of current assessments focus on the sole exposure to invasive alien species (IAS), without considering native species' response to the threat. Here, we address this gap by assessing vertebrates' vulnerability to biological invasions, combining measures of both (i) exposure to 304 identified IAS and (ii) realized sensitivity of 1600 native vertebrates to this threat. We used the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species to identify species threatened by IAS, their distribution, and the species' range characteristics of their associated IAS. We found that 38% of worldwide terrestrial lands are exposed to biological invasions, but exposure alone was insufficient to assess vulnerability since we further found that most of the world hosted native species sensitive to biological invasions. We delineated areas highly vulnerable to biological invasions, that is, combining areas of high exposure and high sensitivity to IAS, located in Australia and coastal states of North America with a high confidence level, but also—depending on the group—in Pacific islands, Southern America, Western Europe, Southern Africa, Eastern Asia, and New-Zealand with a medium confidence level. Assessing the completeness in exposure data, we revealed strong biases in the global description of the well-known invasion hotspots, with limited areas being assessed with a medium to high confidence level. The completeness of sensitivity was overall very high, for the three studied taxonomic groups. We also demonstrated that coldspots of vulnerability to biological invasions were areas of low confidence in terms of data completeness, which coincided with biodiversity hotspots. There is thus a critical need to address these knowledge shortfalls which jeopardize efficient conservation initiatives, regarding the threats to well-known vertebrate taxa.","1354-1013

Three recently published books with a common theme of biological diversity and conservation provide excellent insights into the past and present of the enigmatic island of Madagascar. Offering a welcome syntheses of misconceptions of events in recent times (Goodman and Jungers, Scales), a current overview of the geographical range of species (Goodman and Raherilalao), and broad perspectives on the present state of conservation and environmental management in Madagascar (Scales), these books are a valuable addition to the literature for a wide audience. The challenges laid down by Scales are a must read for those seeking to understand the current plight of the island and anyone with an interest in the environmental future of Madagascar. Extinct Madagascar is another masterpiece from Steve Goodman, this time in partnership with Bill Jungers (who brings his palaeontology and eco-morphology expertise to the fore), that provides fascinating reconstructions of the fate of some of the extraordinary fauna of Madagascar. Throughout, the exquisite plates by Velizar Simeonovski, which combine superb artistic work with anatomical understanding, underpin the work. The book is extremely accessible for non-academic readers, who will gain a clear picture of the widespread changes to the Malagasy flora and fauna and how these changes occurred, and yet will satisfy the scientific community because it provides a comprehensive set of references that can be used as a guide to further in-depth research. Following a concise introductory section that puts the recent past and present in perspective, including critical explanation of the controversies surrounding issues such as the vegetation composition and the arrival of humans on Madagascar, the book is structured around a series of plate-by-plate case studies that examine possible causes of extinction of the past fauna in locations across the island. The scene is set for these case studies through informative text on the sources of information used to support the subsequent putative causes of extinction. Goodman and Jungers carefully weave together multiple strands of fossil, subfossil, and other evidence that support competing hypotheses (p. 52) on the loss of species. Later, a very salient point is made (p. 70) that a concentration on the excavation of large-bodied animals can mask more widespread aspects of change. Ecological shifts affected the small mammal fauna too, but they are more poorly documented through subfossil collections. It becomes clear that little is straightforward over both space and time, often across small distances (i.e., regional rather than whole island) and short periods (ecological rather than evolutionary time scales). Certain cases clearly refute the theory of megafaunal extinction solely at the hands of humans, the dramatic ecological changes that took place around Tsimanampetsotsa (pp. 79–86) being a prime example, although hunting by humans is evidently responsible in other instances (e.g., Taolambiby, pp. 87–93). Entirely stochastic, rapid events such as a major tsunami are implicated in places (Andrahomana, pp. 74–78), while a slower process of gradual ecological change based on a synergy of hypotheses can be inferred from other sites (Belo sur Mer, pp. 112–119). In the latter instance, climate change could be used as a convenient causal factor in extinction, but it is lazy to consider this and it actually hides a more complex and nuanced scenario played out over time with some human involvement at a relatively late stage. As well as reconstructing potential scenarios for animal extinctions through paleontological and archaeological evidence, some case studies also provide valuable information on the shifts in vegetation and changes in composition that have occurred over short periods. The current phyto-geographical maps of Madagascar disguise a recent dynamic past, and this is emphasized at Ampasambazimba (pp. 133–143). Here, pollen cores reveal notable patterns of change at the end of the Pleistocene, followed by more recent changes (c.1400 years BP) driven by human modification of the landscape. The modern day maps rely on an artificial classification of eastern and western forest types further confused by the present “savannah” land cover that may mask a transitional zone between humid and dry forest in the past. Reconstructing the vegetation at certain sites has also been aided by the anatomical and eco-morphological skills of the authors and illustrator. Although there may be some creative license in certain details of the plates, inferences about diet, behavior, posture, and locomotion modes of the various animals lead to valid assumptions about the nature and architecture of the surrounding vegetation environment necessary for particular life-styles. The sloth-lemur (Palaeopropithecus maximus) is described as “one of the most suspensory primates ever to evolve on earth” (p.135), which means that primarily closed canopy forest must have been present in areas now within a savannah and grassland zone in the central highlands. In short, Extinct Madagascar is an engaging window into the recent animal extinctions in Madagascar, describing the basis for the remarkable biological diversity on the island and carefully exploring the past for clues to explain the loss of some species. I hope it will stimulate even more interest in the Malagasy fauna, as well as give warning as to how quickly such variety can be lost. The bilingual Atlas of Selected Land Vertebrates of Madagascar, edited by Steve Goodman in conjunction with Marie Jeanne Raherilalao, provides for the first time excellent detailed maps of the distribution of over 230 species of terrestrial vertebrates. It is the culmination of a monumental body of work collated over more than 2 decades and involving data not only from research groups within Madagascar but also from sources worldwide. The production of this atlas highlights the value of long term research and inventory work and will provide critical information for future researchers, conservation practitioners, and policy makers alike–information that is vital to the future protection of Madagascar's biological diversity. The distribution maps are clear, the text concise, and the relevant detail more easily apparent and properly documented than ever before. A general introduction includes the rationale for the choice of organisms covered by the atlas. The absence of amphibians is due to the weight of recent discoveries that have tripled the number of known species in recent decades; the lack of a focal point for access to discoveries by multiple research groups underpins the exclusion. Another well-studied group, lemurs, are also excluded. Aside from the publication of lemur distribution maps and the availability of projected ranges for many species, there is on going debate as to how many species should actually be accepted as separate entities. Hence, the main groups covered are reptiles (oplurine and gerrosaurid lizards), birds (forest dwelling), and mammals (bats, tenrecs, rodents, and carnivores). Over 42,000 verified records were used for mapping and modeling in the atlas. The short section on technical aspects of the atlas provides clear and excellent information on the methods used in classification of vegetation (including taking account of the projected pre-human colonization distribution), mapping, and modeling (using Maxent). The incorporation of the original vegetation as an environmental variable is critical; biases in species distribution maps may result in scenarios where known environmental change has occurred, such as the recent loss of habitat and rapid climate shifts in Madagascar. The result is a series of individual species accounts that comprise a map of known localities for the species overlain on the reclassified vegetation map of Madagascar, a model map that illustrates the potential distribution of the species (plus brief quantitative information on the model data set and contribution of environmental variables), and a short text with useful ecological information. Of particular note, and suggesting a robust model, the level of congruence between the maps is strong for all species. In evaluating the model used throughout, all species area under the curve values are >0.8 (excellent to high discrimination quality). This is in keeping with the type of value found for species with restricted ranges (as is the case here), even for the volant mammals and birds, and accords with recent insights into the role of physical features of the Malagasy landscape acting as barriers to dispersal. The Atlas of Selected Land Vertebrates of Madagascar provides an invaluable text for researchers, students, and conservation professionals with an interest in Malagasy vertebrates and a very usable guide for those with a concern for biological diversity in Madagascar. The last of the three books, Conservation and Environmental Management in Madagascar, edited by Ivan Scales, draws together research from a diverse range of academic disciplines. It is a timely text that should be required reading for anyone seeking to acquaint themselves with the environmental problems of Madagascar. The work offers very good socio-economic and political background on the island's conservation history, and, with an eye to the future, the concluding chapter offers suggested research and policy priorities that need to be addressed. A brief introduction summarizes the issues surrounding conservation of biological diversity, changes in the environment, and natural resource use and signposts the structure of the book in addressing these matters. Part 1 focuses on the evolutionary background to the extraordinarily rich flora and fauna of Madagascar. First, Ganzhorn et al. explain the long-term events of isolation, colonization, and radiation that underpin the variety of life forms on the island. Then, Dewar brings the reader up to date by examining the dating of the arrival of humans on the island and detailing the impacts of this occurrence. Dewar hints that the complexities of environmental and social systems discussed in subsequent chapters need to be fully understood for an adequate response to current challenges. Two subsequent chapters in part 2 highlight areas of complexity and confusion surrounding deforestation, the process that is generally accepted to be at the heart of Madagascar's environmental problems. The absence of completely accurate research on levels of forest loss is described by McConnell and Kull, who detail technical challenges and methodological shortcomings of forest measurement and point out a clear falsehood –90% forest loss claims– in the literature that is limiting development of sound conservation policy. Scales then explains that lack of understanding of the drivers of forest loss also hamper good environmental discourse and policy. Forest clearance is clearly explained to be the result of a complex set of historical, economic, and political factors and should not be laid at the door of rural householders engaging in agricultural practice that is perceived as environmental suicide by outsiders. Part 3 comprises 5 chapters that trace the history of biodiversity conservation and environmental management in Madagascar. Scales explores the relations among state agencies, environmental policy, and use of natural resources from pre-colonial times and ends by noting that conflict between government and rural people stemmed from environmental legislation and remains a recurring problem. Kull (chapter 7) summarizes the dramatic increase in conservation initiatives, almost exclusively driven by outside interests and funding, that has taken place in Madagascar in the latter half of the last century. The tension between rural Malagasies and the conservation community, particularly around a burgeoning protected area system, is driven by constraints on long-standing rural practices. The section continues with chapters that concentrate on the growth of community-based conservation (Pollini et al.) and the massive expansion in protected areas resulting from the Durban Vision initiative of 2003 (Corson). Both types of conservation effort have met with mixed success. The rights and benefits for those affected by such initiatives appear limited, and all the power during negotiation and implementation remains with conservation organizations, government agencies, donors, and private companies. Finally, Virah-Sawmy et al. provide case studies that examine the rollout of the Durban Vision protected areas in practice. They acknowledge some advances by rural communities in participatory schemes, but true participation is still lacking and the greater involvement of social scientists is suggested for more positive collaboration to ensue. The final section investigates the various types of incentive-based conservation initiatives that have been undertaken in recent years in Madagascar. Scales (p. 255) notes that this gets at the heart of a conservation problem: the successful delivery of conservation outcomes while maintaining economic growth and provision of alternative livelihoods that do not affect natural ecosystems. Nature tourism (chapter 11), bio-prospecting (chapter 12), and payments for ecosystem services (chapter 13) have all met with marginal success; problems include minimal and unevenly distributed benefits, unsustainable harvesting, and the inability to halt deforestation. The penultimate chapter (Kaufmann) seems an oddity within this section because it does not really fit with the general theme. Although the importance of cultural influences cannot be underplayed in conservation efforts, the content seems rather vague and anecdotal compared to the more robust scientific content of the preceding chapters, and the chapter ends with a somewhat vitriolic and unhelpful attack on conservation and its practitioners. Conflict is a common thread in this book and, wisely, in the concluding chapter, Scales notes the need for negotiation and more inter-disciplinary research. Now, more than ever, collaboration among social scientists, conservation biologists, governments, nongovernmental organizations, and—most importantly—the people and communities most heavily affected by conservation activities is essential to successful outcomes in Madagascar. Transparently, a fortress conservation approach will not work in Madagascar, where numerous top-down schemes have already failed or brought only discord. However, there has been limited success with bottom-up community participation approaches. Despite there being little evidence of on-the-ground environmentalism in Madagascar as many perceive it, the Malagasy people may be best placed to develop their own solutions based on their own culture, history, and aspirations. Choices and leadership from within will be important factors in any response, and education and capacity building may provide the most effective assistance outside interests can offer Madagascar.

This is highly controversial [3], in part because of a lack of rigorous scientific studies [4]. Here we present the first empirical evidence of an in situ rewilding project undertaken as a hypothesis-driven ecosystem management option.

We introduced exotic Aldabra giant tortoises, Aldabrachelys gigantea, to disperse the ebony seeds. Not only did the tortoises ingest the large fruits and disperse substantial numbers of ebony seeds, but tortoise gut passage also improved seed germination, leading to the widespread, successful establishment of new ebony seedlings. Our results demonstrate that the introduction of these exotic frugivores is aiding the recovery of ebonies.

1366.0,"Satellite imagery for change detection in the sub-Antarctic: using Heard Island as a proof of concept
","Lucieer, Arko; Robinson, Sharon; Scott, JJ",,,,,2008.0,,,106,106,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Heard Island is a pristine and remote volcanic sub-Antarctic island in the Southern Ocean, south of the Antarctic Polar Frontal Zone (APFZ). Heard Island arguably provides one of the most rapidly changing environments for plant growth in the sub-Antarctic region, due to extensive and rapid glacial retreat which has been accelerated by rising temperatures. There has been minimal human impact on the ecosystem of Heard Island, but warmer conditions will increase the ease for invasion of new species. Its location, climate conditions, and pristine nature make Heard Island an ideal site to study the regional effects of climate change. Up-to-date and accurate spatial information on vegetation is of crucial importance to manage this World Heritage Area and to study its changes. During previous expeditions to Heard Island in 1987/1988 and 2003/2004 terrestrial plant ecology has been studied and vegetation maps have been produced from field samples and aerial photography. These field surveys are expensive, labour intensive, potentially intrusive, and often only cover small areas. Because of the island's remoteness and harsh environment, satellite imagery provides advanced and cost-effective means to map its vegetation cover and to quantify vegetation changes.

",,,,,,"Although New Zealand's 2020 biodiversity strategy, Te Mana o Te Taiao, places a high priority on protecting indigenous ecosystems, it provides minimal detail on how this will be accomplished.Using spatial data and a conservation prioritisation tool we demonstrate the implementation of a comprehensive framework for the systematic conservation of New Zealand's terrestrial ecosystems, as proposed in a pioneering paper by Kelly (1980).Working within the Horizons Region (Manawatū-Whanganui, lower North Island), we analyse the extent of losses of 65 terrestrial ecosystems since human settlement by combining maps of their potential distribution and current land cover.Two-thirds of the original indigenous cover has been lost, with lowland ecosystems suffering greatest losses; much surviving cover is substantially modified.Our prioritisation analyses identify various options for siting conservation management to maintain the integrity of a full range of indigenous ecosystems in a highly modified landscape, given varying degrees of constraint on the availability of land for conservation.Restricting management to DOC-administered land would severely constrain ecosystem representation, but dramatic improvements in ecosystem representation would result from protecting and managing a relatively small number of sites on land of other tenures, mostly at lower elevations.Results such as these could play a crucial role in supporting achievement of New Zealand's high-level goals for ecosystem conservation and meeting international conservation obligations.They could be used to (1) assess the conservation status of individual terrestrial ecosystems, (2) develop national and regional policies specifically targeting protection of at-risk ecosystems, (3) design and implement strategies that explicitly target management across a full range of ecosystems, (4) support processes designed to coordinate management among different conservation actors, and (5) inform individual landowners of the conservation value of indigenous ecosystems on their land.Obstacles to implementing such an approach include a range of technical, institutional, and social factors.

","Watanabe, Takumi; Yamazaki, Yuji",,Philopatry; Affect,,,2025.0,,,,,,,,,,,,"Journal of Zoology
",,"Wiley
",,,,"Secondary contact is a key evolutionary event in understanding biodiversity formation. Elucidating the spatiotemporal effects of sex-specific behavioural patterns on gene flow associated with secondary contact provides valuable perspectives into population dynamics of organisms. The red fox (Vulpes vulpes) is highly dispersible and adaptable, possessing the broadest natural distribution range among the Carnivora. The Hondo red fox (V. v. japonica) is an endemic subspecies inhabiting three predominant islands of the Japanese Archipelago and is believed to have experienced secondary contact between eastern and western ancestral populations after the Last Glacial. Because their dispersal patterns exhibit sexual dimorphism characterised by male mobility and female philopatry, patrilineal and matrilineal genes are expected to reflect different aspects of the distributional fusion process. Here, we estimated the phylogeographic structure based on 11 Y-chromosome-specific microsatellite loci using 50 males and compared it to that based on mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) sequences from 153 individuals. The phylogeny of Y-chromosomal DNA (yDNA) diverged into two clades with a high support rate and was analogous to that of mtDNA. However, no phylogeographic pattern was observed in yDNA, unlike mtDNA, which exhibited a distinct east–west structuring. In contrast to mtDNA clades, both yDNA clades were distributed across the three islands. These findings indicate that secondary contact of paternal lineages progressed earlier (prior to island segmentation through marine transgression in the post-glacial stage) and more broadly than that of maternal lineages. Historical east–west vicariance probably isolated not only females but also males over a long duration, resulting in similar phylogenetic divergence between yDNA and mtDNA. Subsequently, male-biased dispersal likely enhanced gene flow between the ancestral populations, whereas female natal philopatry restricted it. This study offers crucial insights into the evolutionary dynamics of terrestrial mammals with sex-specific life histories and underscores the significance of incorporating multifaceted markers in phylogeographic studies.","0952-8369

",,,,"Snail-eating predators have various specialized organs and predation behaviors to overcome the hard shells and defensive traits of gastropods (Symondson, 2004; Vermeij, 2015). In terrestrial ecosystems, larvae of some species of the Lampyridae, Carabidae, and Elateridae families (Coleoptera) prey on land snails by attaching to the shell and injecting venom to weaken them or else by breaking open the shell with their strong mandibles (Sato, 2019; Symondson, 2004). These snail eaters search actively by tracking land snail mucus trails (Ng et al., 2013; Sato, 2019; Symondson, 2004); no obvious ambush predator of these land snails has so far been found. Here, we report the unique ambush predation of land snails by larvae of Anthracalaus click beetles (Elateridae: Agrypninae) in the larvae's nest burrows. Known Anthracalaus species comprise 17 species from Southeast Asia to Australia (and one species in Arizona, USA). Japan is home to only one species, Anthracalaus sakaguchii, in the Ryukyu Islands (Appendix S1: Figure S1) (Calder & Von Hayek, 1992). Until now, the larval stages of this genus have not been found, and their life histories are completely unknown (Calder & Von Hayek, 1992; Ohira, 2017). During our survey of land snails in the Ryukyus, we found many Satsuma mercatoria (Gastropoda: Camaenidae) killed with their soft body parts pulled into burrows on bare ground at forest edges on Kume Island (Figure 1A; Appendix S1: Figure S2A–D). Elateridae larvae ~3 cm in length collected from these burrows (Figure 1B) were morphologically identified as A. sakaguchii from the adults that emerged in captivity (Appendix S1: Figure S2E). Larvae have sharp sickle-shaped mandibles for predation and forked shovel-like abdominal terga (Figure 1C,D; Appendix S1: Figure S3). During larval habitat and ecological surveys on Kume Island in daytime on 23 January 2020, we examined 43 beetle burrows with dead snails in a 350-m section of bare ground along the forest edges. For each burrow, we recorded the species, number, and shell diameter of dead snails found within 5 cm of the burrow. For comparison, we also recorded snail fauna and abundance in the same section, releasing the snails after measurement, from 9:00 to 10:00 p.m. on 22 January. The predatory behavior of larvae of A. sakaguchii were examined using S. mercatoria collected in the Okinawa Islands. The genus Satsuma comprises large land snails with remarkable speciation, with species and subspecies unique to each of the Ryukyu Islands of Japan. Three endemic Satsuma species—S. mercatoria kumejimaensis, S. perversa, and S. omoro—are distributed on Kume Island (Kameda, 2017). However, two alien S. mercatoria subspecies (S. m. mercatoria and S. m. miyakoensis) that have invaded Kume Island are difficult to identify, so these were treated as ""Satsuma mercatoria"" in this study. Acusta despecta despecta (Bradybaenidae) is a common species widely distributed in the Ryukyu Islands, but the genus is most likely to have lost its regional endemism owing to frequent movement and hybridization between populations caused by anthropogenic transportation (Tomiyama & Imamura, 2020). We found 53 snail shells around the nest burrows, comprising 51 of S. mercatoria (shell diameter mean ± SD 23.1 ± 4.1 mm, range 14.8–30.2 mm) and two of A. despecta despecta (8.5 and 16.8 mm) (Appendix S1: Table S1). Sixteen of these Satsuma snails had just been dragged into the burrow and were still alive, indicating that they were preyed upon during the survey. In the land snail fauna survey, we collected 84 individuals of four species: A. despecta despecta (N = 1, 13.2 mm), Bekkochlamys perfragilis (N = 19, 15.8 ± 0.8 mm, 14.5–17.7 mm), S. mercatoria (N = 63, 22.9 ± 5.1 mm, 12.6–32.1 mm), and S. omoro (N = 1, 17.1 mm). Ground-dwelling arthropods, such as two-spotted crickets (Gryllus bimaculatus) and some cockroaches (e.g., Rhabdoblatta guttigera), were also observed in the survey area, but no predation on these animals was observed. The shells of dead snails reflected the land snail fauna at the site. We have also repeatedly observed predation of Satsuma snails by A. sakaguchii larvae in captivity (Figure 1E; Video S1). The larvae of A. sakaguchii are unique among elaterids in that they form nest burrows and capture land snails. Elateridae larvae are generally categorized as burrowers or wanderers and are almost never known to build nests. The exception is Pyrearinus luminescent click beetles, which form sedentary nests in termite mounds (Costa & Vanin, 2010). The A. sakaguchii's nest burrows were concentrated in bare areas at the forest edge with little vegetation cover; we could not find any in environments with more cover. The nest entrance of last instar larvae (body length 30–40 mm) was 8–10 mm in diameter and 10–20 cm deep. The tunnels were oval and winding, and just below the entrance was a space created early in nest construction that widens on one side (Figure 1E; Video S2). During pupation, this space is widened, and the nest entrance and tunnel are sealed with soil to create the pupal chamber. A sketch of a Pyrearinus nest by Costa and Vanin (2010) similarly shows a small atrium near the entrance, which they describe as a ""marshaling yard"" that serves to store predigested prey and facilitate the reversal of larval migration. The similarity in nest shape between Pyrearinus and Anthracalaus is interesting in considering their phylogenetic relationship. Another ground-burrowing predator, such as the tiger beetle (Coleoptera: Cicindelidae) larvae, construct much straighter burrows and feed mainly on arthropods and rarely prey on land snails (Hori, 1982). Although A. sakaguchii larvae do not have the specialized and conspicuous morphology found in other land-snail eaters, they may be able to efficiently prey on land snails in a unique way by using their nest burrows. The soft parts of the captured snail are dragged into a narrow burrow, where the shell jams at the entrance of the nest, allowing the larvae to pull out and eat all the soft parts. Satsuma and Acusta land snails defend themselves by shaking their shells against predators that attach to the shell, such as firefly larvae (Sato, 2019), but this defense does not appear to be effective against attack from beneath by A. sakaguchii larvae. Our finding indicates the existence of a novel ambush predation method in a snail-eating insect and sheds light on an overlooked interspecific interaction. This is an interesting case for advancing the study of predator–prey interactions between snail eaters and land snails to yield critical insights in evolutionary biology. We cannot yet define A. sakaguchii as a snail-eating specialist. Our survey of larval food items may be biased because snail shells are not edible and thus remain conspicuous around the nest burrows. However, the larvae accurately attacked the soft parts and repeatedly preyed on snails, and many of them were observed feeding on land snails during the survey. This observation implies that A. sakaguchii is adapted to snail predation and is highly dependent on land snails as a food source during the larval stage. Furthermore, they may attract land snails in some way (e.g., odors) for efficient predation, as do termite-eating Pyrearinus larvae (Costa & Vanin, 2010). Because land snails often actively feed on the carcasses and shells of other individuals for calcium and protein (Baur, 1992; Ozgo & Bogucki, 2006), the dead flesh left at the entrance to the nest burrow may attract even more prey. Future research should focus on the feeding habits of A. sakaguchii larvae and how the larvae attract land snails to their nests. Satsuma mercatoria kumejimaensis has been registered as a national endangered species under the Act on Conservation of Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora since February 2020. S. omoro has been registered under a wildlife protection ordinance of Okinawa prefecture since November 2020. Almost all of Kume Island lies within the Kume-jima Prefectural Natural Park, where a wildlife protection ordinance has been in force since September 2022. This study was conducted outside of the protected area outside of the time frame of these laws and ordinances. Conceptualization: Nozomu Sato and Hisanori Okamiya.

",,,,"Cox, G.W. (1999) Alien species in North America and Hawaii: impacts on natural ecosystems. Island Press, Washington. xii + 387 pp, tables, glossary, index. Hardback: Price US$60.00. ISBN 1 559 63679 3. Paperback: Price US$30.00. ISBN 1 559 63680 7. In the clear, concise style characterizing Cox’s previous texts from his Dynamic ecology (1973) to Conservation biology: concepts and applications (1997), his latest work, Alien species in North America and Hawaii: impacts on natural ecosystems, constitutes a comprehensive synthesis of the history, distribution, impacts, management initiatives and policy dilemmas of some the most noxious introduced species in the 10 most seriously affected regions of the United States. Canada is treated to a much lesser degree and Mexico is mentioned in passing on only six occasions. The stated objective of the book is ‘to evaluate exotic invasions of North America in the light of the emerging science of invasion ecology’, and to ‘examine the seriousness of the threat of these invaders to North America, and what can be done to reduce this threat.’ As the subtitle suggests, the book is not a dispassionate evaluation of exotics. Rather, it attempts to fill the ‘education gap’ between concerned environmentalists and ‘the public at large [that] remains largely unaware of the seriousness of the threat’ to the native flora and fauna of North America, ‘the largest battleground in the global war against invasive exotics.’ The approach is nonmathematical, better described as a descriptive catalogue than an analytical treatize. For the layperson, the book provides numerous examples of aggressive exotics from representative biomes of North America, the full range of invaders (plants, plant diseases, marine invertebrates, terrestrial invertebrates, insects, freshwater fish and terrestrial vertebrates) and across a broad range of habitat types (bays, estuaries, lakes, rivers and streams, forests, tropical and semitropical lowlands, plains and intermontane grasslands, floodplains, mediterranean ecosystems, and island ecosystems). In addition to the litany of geographically referenced species accounts, also presented are their myriad impacts in clear nontechnical language, as well as a cursory review of existing invasion theory. A short, but well-conceived, glossary clarifies technical terms and theoretical concepts. To its merit, the book considers impacts beyond simply those on charismatic or priority conservation species, also presenting community and ecosystem level impacts. The most significant contribution for the technical audience is the extensive cataloguing of exotics and their impacts based on a thorough and well-referenced review of both historical and current publications; many references come from the 1999 primary literature. Also useful is a three-page listing of internet sites dedicated to exotic species. The book is divided into five parts with each of the 21 chapters being introduced with effective and engaging case studies that present key conceptual issues to follow. Part I provides the historical and conceptual background upon which the regional treatments of Part II are based. Here the uninitiated receive a ‘crash course’ in invasion ecology ranging from the source, identity and attributes of some classic invaders such as the zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha), the history of exotic species introductions and their studies with the de rigeur references to Elton’s pioneering work The Ecology of Invasions by Animals & Plants (1958) and Carson’s Silent Spring (1962), and the magnitude of ecological and economic impacts of ‘biotic pollution.’ The comprehensive 10 regional treatment chapters of Part II constitute the bulk of the book. Spanning the whole of the United States and drawing on examples from the primary literature, Cox demonstrates convincingly that not all ecosystems are equally invasible and no single theory can account for invasions and their impacts. For example, reviewing case studies from his home state, California, it is argued that species rich areas commonly considered more ‘stable’ and less invasible are in some instances highly vulnerable to aggressive exotics from a range of taxa. While the impacts of exotics are most evident in Hawaii where they have occasioned both documented extinctions and quantifiable ecosystem function disruption, Cox emphasizes that ‘unpredictability is a key feature in invasions’ and that they often lead to unforeseen outcomes such as ‘food web chaos’. Part III introduces some of the dilemmas created by exotic species, associated impacts and their management. Deliberately introduced game species, such as the brown trout, ring-necked pheasant and sika deer are often seen as desirable. Likewise, control of native North American species with anthropogenically extended ranges is fraught with controversy. Finally, a chapter dedicated to problems associated with domesticated species gone feral, ‘our best friends and closest associates’, provides a vivid example of the many conflicting issues of ecology and ethics. In particular for the lay audience, this section constitutes an effective means of tempering the knee-jerk response of ‘why isn’t anyone doing anything?’ that many of the preceding examples may have provoked. Additionally it demands that the reader consider his own role in species introductions and their control. Whereas the regional treatment briefly introduces some theoretical aspects of invasion ecology, Part IV is specifically dedicated to this purpose. The format is standard (invader attributes and differential ecosystem vulnerability) and the theories presented are well known to professional ecologists (variable invasibility of successional stages, the relevance of assembly rules, niche breadth and openness, and disturbance). However, this short section provides some of the most interesting reading and insightful commentary. The varied nature of impacts is also considered including abiotic ecosystem impacts such as those on hydrology and fertility to biotic impacts, including those on trophic structure or occasioned by genetic swamping via hybridization between natives and exotics. Surely a matter of opinion, the book may have benefited from this section occurring before the regional treatment thereby providing a theoretical backdrop upon which the many specific case studies of Part II might be considered. Cox boldly closes in Part V with a presentation of the economic implications of exotic species and management options that exist to control them. The book concludes with an explicit review of the shortcomings of existing management institutions and their lack of integration and provides concrete recommendations for the strengthening of global and national organizations charged with exotic species management. He notes these will be increasingly called upon as invasions continue with cultural and economic globalization and as their impacts become even less predictable in the face of global environmental change. Although the examples provided are confined to North America, the wide range of climates and habitat types considered makes the book relevant to those interested in biological invasions from other areas. Being a discipline involving rates of change over time, correlations involving multiple factors and subjects considered within a geographical context, the use of illustrations, figures and diagrams would have enhanced the well-conceived text. While useful data is frequently presented in tabular form, other graphic representations are lacking. Given the importance of scale and spatial context, maps in particular would have been useful. Although the well-written text might have benefited from the inclusion of such graphical conceptual aids, on the whole the book represents a valuable contribution to the invasion literature for lay and technical audience alike. No original data, results or theories to explain the many invasions are presented, but the book clearly achieves the professed goal of reviewing the state of alien invasions in North America in attempting to fill the existing education gap between the informed environmentalist and uninformed public at large.

",,,,"Datasets from natural history collections and biodiversity monitoring are a valuable source of information for assessing the impacts of global environmental problems such as climate change, habitat loss, and the spread of invasive species. The OKEON (OKinawa Environmental Observation Network) Churamori Project described here is a terrestrial monitoring network led by a university institution, Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology (OIST), which aims to investigate how these various global environmental problems affect local nature. The documentation of biodiversity has continued without pause from 2015 to the present, and includes insect specimens, automated wildlife images, soundscape data, and weather data at study sites covering a variety of land use categories, from subtropical forests to urban areas. Our emphasis in this project is on collaborative networks, which include not only the researcher network but also local networks (Fig. 1). The role of the researcher network is to collaborate with us to set the direction of the project and make recommendations to maintain data quality, while the role of the local network is to allow the use of the research sites and to collaborate with us to create opportunities and methods to share the results of this project with the general public. Since all 24 OKEON research sites are not owned by the university, but leased by others, we set up the sites after discussions with the local network (museums, government officials, landowners, etc.) as well as within the research network. This project is a monitoring project conducted for research, and all raw data cannot be made available to the public. However, one of the objectives of the project is to transform the results such that they can be used by the local community and disseminated outside the university, rather than used solely for academic research at the university. The following are three categories of examples for how the project results may be used: Academic research: Some studies have been conducted that are only possible because of OKEON's continuous monitoring. For example, an evaluation was conducted to determine if there is an effect of land use on changes in the seasonality of organisms and the rate of recovery from natural disturbances such as typhoons (Kass et al. 2023, Ross et al. 2023). Research is also underway to use DNA metabarcoding techniques to analyze insect diversity from the vast amount of insect samples obtained in all seasons on Okinawa-jima Island. Environmental education: OKEON shares its know-how on monitoring methods with local high schools and supports their educational programs. Specimen samples obtained from high school educational activities are shared with OKEON so that high school students and teachers can participate in this program as citizen scientists (Yoshimura 2024). In addition, the results of this program are disseminated to the public through environmental education programs and exhibits provided to landowners, resort hotels in the prefecture, museums, and other organizations to promote conservation. Social implementation: Based on the results of monitoring research on ants at OKEON, a monitoring method for detecting and measuring the effectiveness of control of invasive ants has been established, and measures against invasive species in the local area have been implemented with external funding. In addition, a mammalian invasive species alert system using OKEON image data is being developed within the OKEON research network, and is being implemented in local government projects. Furthermore, a plan is underway to use the OKEON network as a model region in a research project to propose a method for introducing protected areas in Okinawa.

In recent years, the development of citizen science and data infrastructures such as the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) have contributed greatly to the accumulation of global biodiversity data, but at a more local scale, there are still large regional gaps in information. In areas where biodiversity information tends to be lacking, there is a possibility that monitoring can be started and/or continued on a stable basis if the results are relevant to local issues. The biggest challenge in long-term monitoring is how to continue. Even in OKEON, continuity is sometimes threatened due to changes in the organizational structure. In order to continue, it will be necessary to integrate various institutions to create a more robust network of collaboration, and to make the project both academically valuable and useful in solving local problems.

",,,,"Abstract Relatively little is known about red fox ( Vulpes vulpes ) spatial ecology on barrier islands, where semi‐linear habitat distribution and aquatic barriers may affect terrestrial movements. Because red foxes often are a predator of imperiled shorebirds in these ecosystems, and predation is often managed along with other factors such as habitat limitation, this information is needed to inform effective holistic management. The goals of this study were to describe red fox spatial ecology in a barrier island ecosystem and compare these findings to the existing literature on red fox space use in other coastal settings. We used global positioning system (GPS) collar data collected from 2015–2018 from 31 red foxes to estimate sizes of home ranges and core‐use areas, describe daily activity patterns, and investigate within‐home‐range resource selection among red foxes on Fire Island, New York, USA. Twenty‐two of 31 red foxes maintained distinct home ranges throughout the monitoring period, while 9 were transient, regularly traveling through the home ranges of other red foxes and among management units across the island. Observed GPS‐collared red fox home range sizes (95% time local convex hull [t‐LoCoH] isopleths) ranged from 10 ha to 659 ha, averaging 59 ± 7 ha (SE) among resident foxes and 447 ± 46 ha among transient foxes. Core‐use areas (50% t‐LoCoH isopleths) ranged from &lt;1 ha to 268 ha, averaging 10 ± 1 ha among resident foxes and 67 ± 27 ha among transient foxes. Hourly minimum movement rates varied across the diel cycle and among individuals, averaging 216 m/hour ± 9 m/hour, and were highest 13–22 hours after sunrise. Within‐home‐range resource selection varied among activity periods. For example, red foxes selected areas closer than expected to vegetation based on availability during the daytime and twilight hours but farther than expected from vegetation at night. We recommend vegetation management in and around shorebird nesting areas to reduce daytime resting sites and hunting cover for red foxes while improving suitability for use by nesting shorebirds. We also suggest coordination of predator management activities across agencies in this situation and in others where predators regularly cross management unit boundaries. Overall, we found that many aspects of red fox space use in the study area, such as smaller average home ranges compared to those in other ecosystems, were similar to that of red foxes in other coastal settings; additional research is needed to determine whether this holds true in other barrier island systems.

",,,,,,"The introduced Japanese weasel, Mustela itatsi, has had a significant negative impact on indigenous terrestrial vertebrates across several islands in the Miyako Group. The present study aimed to assess the current population status of squamate reptiles by investigating the distributions and abundances of three endangered lizards, Plestiodon kishinouyei, Takydromus toyamai, and Emoia atrocostata atrocostata, on Shimojijima Island and Irabujima Island. Route censuses for these species were conducted in the periods from 30 July to 4 August and 8–13 October 2022. Additionally, opportunistic sightings of lizards outside of the designated censuses were recorded. Eight P. kishinouyei, 20 T. toyamai, and seven E. a. atrocostata were recorded along four out of 101 survey routes, six out of 76, and two out of 39, respectively, with one additional E. a. atrocostata sighting at a non-census site. Plestiodon kishinouyei and E. a. atrocostata exhibited highly restricted distribution: the former was exclusively found in the northwestern part of Shimojijima Island, whereas the latter was confined to the southwestern part, with no presence on Irabujima Island. Takydromus toyamai was observed on both Shimojijima Island and Irabujima Island. The frequency of occurrence was low for the two skink populations on Shimojijima Island and T. toyamai on Irabujima Island, suggesting a potential population decline. These findings provide baseline data on the population status of these three lizard species. Such data will be crucial for evaluating their prospects for recovery, particularly considering the ongoing extensive eradication project targeting the introduced Japanese weasel on these islands.

",,,,"ABSTRACT Aim We assessed the influence of island isolation on the composition of insular bird assemblages with a particular focus on species traits associated with dispersal. To do so, we tested whether ecomorphological metrics of dispersal ability, namely hand‐wing index and Kipp's distance, increase with increasing island isolation. Location Global. Taxon Birds. Methods We integrated global datasets of island characteristics with distribution and ecomorphological trait information of birds; our final dataset comprised information for 2034 native, resident and terrestrial species inhabiting 2399 islands. Species restricted to islands were removed to avoid potentially confounding effects of speciation, such as the evolution of flightlessness or poor flight on islands. Using the generalised additive models, we tested for the relationship between hand‐wing index or Kipp's distance and island isolation, accounting for the effects of island area and spatial autocorrelation. We performed the analyses separately for (i) continental and oceanic islands and (ii) for all terrestrial birds and for passerine birds only. Results Hand‐wing index and Kipp's distance were positively related to island isolation on oceanic islands, that is bird communities on more isolated oceanic islands were composed of species with wings that had a higher aspect ratio and were more elongated. However, this relationship did not hold for continental islands. We found these patterns to be consistent for all terrestrial birds as well as for passerine birds only. Main Conclusion Our study provides strong evidence that island isolation influences the trait composition of island bird assemblages at a global scale. Our results highlight the variation of dispersal‐related ecomorphological traits among bird assemblages on islands, suggesting that these traits play an important role in mediating the influence of island isolation on community assembly processes on islands.

",,,,"Limestone forests are the most diverse natural plant communities of Guam. Like other natural vegetation types, these forests have a long history of anthropogenic disturbances, being altered and shaped by humans for more than 4,000 years. Although this occupation represents a relatively long human influence in comparison to other Pacific islands, animals associated with humans, such as commensal rodents, arrived in these islands beginning only 1,000 years ago, and larger mammals, such as pigs (Sus scrofa), may not have arrived until European contact. Limestone forests, which also occur on several other Mariana Islands, developed in the presence of frequent tropical storms and are therefore well adapted to this type of natural disturbance regime. However, recent human activities including large scale clearing and conversion combined with the presence of high levels of alien herbivores and seed predators, and the loss of ecological services provided by the former native avifauna may be causing the decline of Guam's forests. Limestone forests on northern Guam, much like those of other Mariana Islands, were heavily cleared for the construction of military installations during World War II. The accidental introduction of the Brown Tree Snake (Boiga irregularis; BTS) around this same period subsequently accelerated the disappearance of Guam's native avifauna and other endemic terrestrial vertebrates, and with them, seed dispersal, pollination, and the predatory regulation of herbivorous insects. Guam and the Mariana Islands contained a high proportion (32 pecent) of endemic bird species, with 4 forms endemic to Guam alone: the now extinct Guam Flycatcher (Myiagra freycineti), and Guam Bridled White-eye (Zosterops conspicillatpicillata), one of three island endemic subspecies from the Marianas; Guam rail (Rallus owstonii); and Guam Kingfisher (Todiramphus cinnamominus cinnamominus), an island endemic subspecies of the regionally endemic Micronesian Kingfisher. Guam once supported the Mariana Gallinule (Gallinula chloropus guami), the Mariana Mallard (Anas platyrhynchos oustaleti), Mariana Fruit-Dove (Ptilinopus roseicapilla), White-throated Ground Dove (Gallicolumba xanthonura xanthonura), Mariana Crow (Corvus kubaryi), and the Nightingale Reed-warbler (Acrocephalus luscinia), all endemic to the Mariana Islands. Other regionally endemic endangered species include the Micronesian Megapode (Megapodius laperouse), and the Mariana Swiftlet (Aerodramus bartschi), now reduced to a small population on Guam. Likewise, the flora of Guam is unique, with 21percent of its native vascular plants endemic to the Mariana Islands. In limestone forests of Northern Guam, a number of tall forest tree species such as joga, Elaeocarpus joga (Elaeocarpaceae); pengua or Macaranga thompsonii (Euphorbiaceae); ifit or Intsia bijuga (Fabaceae); seeded breadfruit or Artocarpus marianensis (Moraceae); and umumu or Pisonia grandis (Nyctaginaceae) may be in decline as a result of herbivory by mammals. All show reduced regeneration and age distributions highly skewed towards older individuals. These species provided important habitat for some of Guam's endangered forest birds that remain in captivity such as the Mariana Crow, Guam Kingfisher, and Guam Rail. The recent high frequency of intense tropical storms and herbivory caused by large populations of feral pigs and Philippine sambar deer (Cervus mariannus), as well as invasive alien vines that may suppress tree regeneration, could be permanently altering the structure of regenerating forests and composition of important canopy species on secondary limestone substrates that were cleared and compacted during airfield construction from 1944 through the 1970s. Guam National Wildlife Refuge (GNWR) was established at Ritidian Point, after it was determined to be excess property by the U.S. Navy. Most of the refuge, about 9,087 hectares, is an 'overlay refuge' on lands administered by the U.S. Air Force and U.S. Navy. Although the military mission comes first on these lands, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service assists in protecting native species and habitats. The recovery of limestone forest on Guam for forest bird habitat may require intensive management, including reduction of feral herbivores, propagation, out-planting, weed control, and periodic suppression of herbivorous insects. Research to support these techniques may be best accomplished in small areas where potential limiting factors can easily be experimentally manipulated. Area 50, a 24 ha enclosure, contains a relictual patch of relatively undisturbed limestone forest surrounded by tarmac allowing easy access and management opportunities to control alien mammals and snakes. These species have been periodically managed in the past, but recent typhoons have damaged snake-proofing on the enclosure fence. A new concrete barrier is planned to provide more permanent control opportunities within this enclosed area or another similar area, thereby allowing experimental research for various management regimes. Eradication and control of alien vertebrate and plant pests will provide habitat where native communities can be restored in a small, intensively managed area. The stated aim of this project is to ""affect ecosystem restoration through the removal and exclusion of introduced species and the reestablishment and propagation of native species, with focus on the reintroduction of native forest bird species."" This will be achieved by constructing a multispecies barrier surrounding the area, coordinated eradication of selected alien species within the area, and possible reintroduction of Mariana Crow, Guam Kingfisher, and Guam Rail. This barrier also allows experimental research questions to be addressed within the small enclosure around Area 50 that may be applied to manage and restore the larger areas of limestone forest on northern Guam and also similar forests on other islands of the Marianas.

","Fowler, Simon",,Flora; Scale insect,,,2005.0,,,52,63,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"The small South Atlantic island of St. Helena has a highly degraded but internationally significant terrestrial flora, now covering only 1% of its land area. The 2500 gumwood trees, Commidendrum robustum, in the last two natural stands, are an important part of this remnant flora. In 1991, a scale insect infesting the gumwoods was identified as Orthezia insignis. This South American pest is widespread in the tropics, but this was the first record from St. Helena. By 1993, there were severe patches of infestation of the scale, and over 100 gumwood trees were dead. If the exponential increase in the number of dead trees had continued, all 2500 trees would have been killed by 1995. This was a likely outcome given the lack of natural enemies, and abundance of alternative host plant species for the scale. Fortunately, O. insignis had a history of successful biological control in Hawaii, and several African countries, through the introduction between 1908 and 1959 of the predatory South American coccinellid beetle, Hyperaspis pantherina. The life history and environmental safety of the predator were studied in quarantine in the U.K., and in 1993 the St. Helena government gave permission for its introduction onto the island. In May 1993, 80 H. pantherina survived the 6-day journey to St. Helena, and were used to establish a laboratory colony, from which over 5000 beetles were released from June 1993 to February 1994. Monitoring was undertaken using visual counts of O. insignis and H. pantherina on 300 labelled branchlets on the gumwood trees. Although the cause of tree death was visually obvious, monitoring demonstrated significant correlations between the levels of attack by the scale and tree mortality. H. pantherina was detected on the labelled shoots in February 1994, and numbers then increased, coinciding with a 30× decrease in mean scale numbers. This measured reduction is conservative, because the number of live scales tended to be underestimated when debris from recent feeding by the coccinellid was present. There have been no further problems reported with the scale on St. Helena since 1995. Laboratory rearing of H. pantherina was discontinued in July 1995 because insufficient O. insignis could be found anywhere on the island. Biological control of O. insignis was successful, but the extensive blackening from sooty moulds on all surviving gumwood trees in February 1995, suggested that the predator was effective only just in time to prevent most of the trees being killed. Experimental transfers of O. insignis showed that the other three members of the endemic genus Commidendrum could also be at risk from the scale. The deliberate introduction of H. pantherina into St. Helena is an early example of biological control being initiated solely for conservation of indigenous biodiversity. It appears that this successful programme has saved the field population of a rare endemic plant from extinction.",,,,,,,,,,,,No,,,,,,,0.9960009217262268,1,0.001302857369833378,1.0,5,268.0

",,,,"“Nothing could possibly live there!” They said. Indeed, until recently, few specialized cave-adapted animals were known from volcanic, tropical, or oceanic island caves, and plausible theories had been put forward to explain their absence. But assume nothing in science! One must illuminate, explore, and survey habitats before declaring them barren. Our understanding of cave biology changed dramatically about 50 years ago following the serendipitous discovery of cave-adapted insects and other terrestrial arthropods in lava caves on the young oceanic islands of the Galapagos and Hawai‘i. The discovery and subsequent studies on the evolutionary ecology of cave animals have revealed a remarkable hidden fauna and created new sub-disciplines within biospeleology. Biological surveys of caves in other regions have confirmed the results developed in Hawai‘i. We now predict that, rather than being relicts trapped in caves by changing climate, animals actively colonized caves and adapted to exploit food resources wherever there were suitable subterranean voids. The physical environment in caves can be determined with great precision because the habitat is buffered by rock. Furthermore, the bizarre adaptations displayed by obligate cave animals are similar across many taxonomic groups. These two characteristics make caves nearly ideal natural laboratories for studying evolution and ecology. However, to the untrained researcher, caves can appear hostile and dangerous, and in fact, fieldwork in caves requires a unique marriage of athletic ability and science. In other words, it is exciting! Join me on a virtual tour of exploration, discovery, and research in caves during the past half-century.

",,"Wiley
",,,,"Professor Arnthor Gardarsson (1938–2022) was an Icelandic ornithologist who made a major contribution to the studies of the bird fauna of Iceland and to the ecology of waterfowl and wetland conservation. After finishing a BSc in Zoology from the University of Bristol in 1962 he went to the University of California, Berkeley, for a PhD project under the supervision of Professor Frank A. Pitelka. His project, finished in 1971, was about the population and feeding ecology of the Icelandic Ptarmigan Lagopus muta islandorum. In 1971–73, working with the Icelandic Museum of Natural History, he conducted a research programme on the ecology of the Thjorsarver area. This tundra oasis in the otherwise desert-like Icelandic highlands harboured the world's largest breeding colony of the Pink-footed Goose Anser brachyrhynchus and was under serious threat by hydropower development. A part of this ecosystem-oriented study involved aerial surveys of birds, a method that was to become one of Arnthor's signature research tools. Waterfowl held a special place in Arnthor's heart. The opportunity to study them in detail came in 1974 when Lake Myvatn, the world-renowned waterfowl site in Iceland, was defined as a nature reserve. This was in the wake of a heated debate over a hydropower project that would have fundamentally altered the lake's ecology. In 1974, Arnthor became professor in zoology at the new biology department of the University of Iceland and he promptly focused his academic research effort on Lake Myvatn. The idea was to monitor the ecological situation of the lake by studying its many duck populations. Despite the newly acquired protection status, there was concern about ongoing industrial sediment extraction from the lake (continuing till 2004). Arnthor's efforts, with students and collaborators, soon developed into a full-scale ecological study of the lake's foodweb, benefiting from his deep insight into ecological processes. His research revealed immense fluctuations in the Lake Myvatn ecosystem, that still occur and continue to attract scientific interest. The studies resulted in a series of classic papers, demonstrating how the variable abundance of aquatic insects and crustaceans in a lake determined duckling production and subsequent changes in breeding populations. It was Arnthor's ambition to obtain a comprehensive picture of the bird populations of Iceland, their distribution, size, production, resources, and trends. It was a gargantuan task, considering the size, remoteness and ruggedness of the landscape and the sheer number of birds. But Arnthor was a daredevil who was quick to apply aerial surveys to the mapping and photographing of all the important bird areas, both coastal and inland, and he kept seeking new techniques to this effect. Estimating bird densities in the immense, towering seabird colonies of northwest Iceland was his biggest challenge. His final solution was to fly low over and then off the cliff edge, taking a rapid succession of photographs with a large-format camera aimed slightly backwards – a rather risky undertaking with the myriad of fast-flying birds around. His aerial endeavours, backed up by field studies, resulted in comprehensive population estimates of alcids, Black-legged Kittiwakes Rissa tridactyla, Northern Fulmars Fulmarus glacialis, Northern Gannets Morus bassanus, European Shags Gulosus aristotelis, Great Cormorants Phalacrocorax carbo, Common Eiders Somateria mollissima and other ducks, swans, geese and even passing migratory waders such as Red Knots Calidris canutus, Ruddy Turnstones Arenaria interpres and Sanderlings Calidris alba. Later he extended the surveying to cover all the Atlantic Puffin Fratercula arctica colonies of Iceland and developed methods to monitor seabird trends via ground-based observations. Arnthor also used his skills to reveal the details of the population dynamics of European Shags and Great Cormorants in the Breidafjördur archipelago, their central stronghold in Iceland. Spring field trips with his students to the impressive seabird colonies in the northwest of Iceland made an enduring impact on many, who are now continuing and expanding the monitoring work on birds in marine, freshwater and terrestrial habitats all over Iceland. Arnthor served as a chairman of the Nature Conservation Council in 1990–96, a government advisory body that also managed protected areas. Through this he became a leading figure in the protection of many of the ecosystems he had studied, in particular Thjorsarver and Myvatn, the crown jewels of inland wetland sites in Iceland. In addition to his extensive ornithological skills, Arnthor had a fascination for terrestrial and marine invertebrates, polychaetes in particular, and he was proficient in botany. He was also artistic and made a name for himself at a young age when illustrating papers on bird life. Arnthor's character may be described as an attractive mix of generousity, ambition and shyness, as well as being humble, friendly and joyful. In 1959 Arnthor married Gudrun Sveinbjarnardóttir (1937–2016), an economist from Reykjavik. They had two children, Soffia and Thrandur.

The huillín has a continuous distribution in fjords and southern channels, with a marine population probably greater than the continental one. The chungungo uses the ocean coast from the Guaitecas Islands to Cape Horn. Both species were found sympatrically on the Hermanas, Velasco, Mornington, Beauclerck and Contreras islands.

The Protected Areas in Chile are mostly terrestrial, and its importance for otter protection and its habitat is discussed. By their definition the Multiple Use Marine Protected Areas include productive activities, without certainty about their efficiency in protecting huillín/chungungo. The “Francisco Coloane” Marine Park, of only 1,506 hectares, represents the only sector in which the huillín has absolute protection, and the “Kawésqar” National Reserve, which covers the maritime territory around the “Kawésqar” National Park, brings together 82% of the salmon farming concessions in Magallanes, so its importance for the protection of huillín/chungungo is questionable.

Various activities and projects under development in the Aysén/Magallanes region are exempt from submission to the Environmental Impact Study System. The study of 1,563 projects related to marine and freshwater habitats, mentioned the huillín in only 5.4% and chungungo in 12.6% of the cases. 0.94% mentioned adverse effects, none of them on the huillín/chungungo, without mitigation, protection and/ or conservation measures for these species.

It is concluded that the situation of the huillín/chungungo in Southern Patagonia requires a thorough review of protection measures, with the establishment of protected areas and biological corridors between sectors and continental populations","0718-6932

A total of 126 forms of 125 species, including hypothetical species, has been recorded in the Shumagins, of which aquatic birds constitute 67% and terrestrial birds 33%. Overall, 52% of all forms breed, probably breed, or formerly bred; of these, aquatic birds represent 57% and terrestrial birds 43%. The avifauna is heavily weighted toward Nearctic (39% of all forms) and Beringian (32%) forms, followed by Holarctic (21%), Palearctic (6%), and Oceanian (2%) forms; breeding taxa are even more heavily weighted toward Beringian (46%) and Nearctic (40%) forms. The Shumagins have few breeding waterfowl, other freshwater birds, and shorebirds and are not on important flyways for any of these groups, despite lying near important spring and fall staging areas on the nearby Alaska Peninsula. The seabird and terrestrial avifaunas are diverse and similar to those in nearby areas, especially the eastern Aleutians. Populations of several seabird species in the Shumagins have declined substantially over the last 40 years. Two terrestrial species, the Pacific Wren (Troglodytes pacificus) and Pine Grosbeak (Pinicola enucleator), have expanded their breeding ranges into this area, and breeding distributions of some terrestrial birds in the outer Shumagins appear to be changing. Changes in range or breeding status have been caused, at least in part, by predation by introduced foxes, overgrazing by introduced cattle degrading already limited habitat, and the introduction of ground squirrels.","0045-3897

It is a small oceanic island (2.5 km2) dominated by volcanic rock with very little vegetal cover. Here, we describe the first endemic arachnid for the island, Ariadna motumotirohiva sp. nov. Females are similar to those of Ariadna perkinsi Simon, 1900 from Hawaiʻi and Ariadna lebronneci Berland, 1933 from the Marquesas in the dorsal dark abdominal pattern, but they differentiate from the latter in the anterior receptaculum, promarginal cheliceral teeth and leg IV macrosetae. A recent survey of the arachnid fauna of Rapa Nui, which included Motu Nui and the rocky shores, did not record the presence of the family Segestriidae, neither has it been found during previous surveys. However, it is not possible to discard the possibility of a local extinction on Rapa Nui and survival on Sala y Gómez. This study suggests other endemic terrestrial arthropods could be present on this very small and remote island.

","Bottrill, Madeleine",,Investment; Promotion (chess),,,2011.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Despite considerable investment of time and resources to protect biodiversity, the status, extent and condition of species and habitats continues to decline. There is limited evidence to demonstrate that efforts are making significant progress towards conservation goals. In the absence of evidence, promotion and justification of investment in different conservation actions is guided by anecdote and experience. The implication of using insufficient knowledge to make decisions is that conservation managers, scientists and policymakers risk wasting scarce time and resources on actions that are neither successful nor cost-effective. This thesis explores ways to determine the effectiveness of conservation efforts through the application of program evaluation – a systematic process of assessing the success and failure of programs. In this thesis, I review the need for explicit evaluation in conservation, in particular for actions that have received little formal reporting or monitoring of their outcomes or impact. I apply a range of quantitative and qualitative methods to demonstrate the utility of program evaluation for measuring the impact of conservation actions, improving program performance and informing allocation of limited resources between different areas and actions. In Chapter 1, I provide an overview of the different uses of evaluation for conservation needs. Furthermore, I describe current approaches to evaluation in biodiversity conservation and highlight a number of limitations and gaps in existing efforts. Over the past 25 years, monitoring and evaluation of conservation interventions and programs has grown considerably; yet there are still many interventions that have received scant attention. In Chapter 2, I argue for more extensive evaluation of the value of systematic conservation planning and describe a set of measures for explicit evaluation of the costs and benefits of planning. I show that the process of planning itself provides valuable social and institutional benefits over and above maps and other ecologically-orientated products. Building upon this review, in Chapter 3, I document for the first time the full range of benefits emerging from the application of a single planning approach, ecoregional assessments, applied on the ground by the international non-government organisation, The Nature Conservancy. Knowledge of the overall impact of conservation efforts on the state of biodiversity and other natural values is limited with many existing frameworks focusing solely on tracking process and outputs. I apply a quantitative evaluation design, using a quasi-experimental method, in Chapter 4 to measure the impact of federal recovery plans on the status of threatened species in Australia. This methodology has never previously been applied to evaluate an Australian environmental policy. Evaluation of program outcomes based on a single measure, e.g., change in species status, can however ignore or underestimate unintended outcomes that emerge from interventions. Integration of both quantitative and qualitative methods can highlight multidimensional aspects of program outcomes as well as factors affecting the effectiveness of programs, by combining different perspectives and data. In Chapter 5, I evaluate outcomes, from terrestrial based conservation projects, using a mixed method approach, in the Pacific island country of Samoa. I find that knowledge on success is limited by a number of barriers to effective monitoring and evaluation by Samoan institutions. Knowledge generated by evaluations can also help inform future decision making. In Chapter 6, I describe a resource allocation framework, based on the principles of triage, for integrating information on probability of success alongside data on the costs and benefits of the action for conserving biodiversity. Finally, in Chapter 7, I provide a synthesis of the thesis, in particular, exploring the contribution of my research to our understanding of evaluation to meet conservation needs. I also outline several cross-cutting themes occurring across the thesis and highlight potential areas for future research. Overall, this research expands our knowledge of conservation effectiveness and demonstrates the usefulness of evaluation for informing and improving conservation decision making. The research presented in this thesis is useful for managers and scientists applying specific conservation actions, policymakers assessing the marginal benefit of their investments and evaluators designing and implementing monitoring and evaluation strategies.

",,,,"In the Philippines, beach forest ecosystems have been beneficial to coastal communities not only in their economic aspects, but also for their ecological values. Hence, there is a need for sustainable management of coastal ecosystems to ensure the survival of the local inhabitants as well as the terrestrial and marine biodiversity as a whole. In order to achieve sustainability, efforts should not be confined to natural resource conservation alone, but an effective integration of community’s knowledge, attitude and perception on the resource value can be an important element to optimize positive impacts. Integration of local’s knowledge, attitudes and perceptions on resources management and conservation has been practiced for other natural ecosystems, but less used for beach forest ecosystems. This is despite the fact that beach forest ecosystem plays a vital role in protecting the coastal communities from hazard vulnerability, among many other services. Hence, this study evaluates the knowledge, attitudes and perceptions of two coastal barangays in Socorro, Bucas Grande Island towards beach forest ecosystem services, and their conservation and management importance. A total of 188 respondents were surveyed using semi-structured questionnaire. Key informant (KI) interviews were also employed to elicit information about the conservation and management efforts by the local government and People’s Organisations (POs).Using descriptive statistics, result showed that local people in both communities have sufficient knowledge on the beach forest services and have positive attitudes in utilizing the resources and conserving the ecosystem because of positive intervention such as environmental seminars and tree-planting programs initiated by Local Government Units (LGUs).Moreover, both sites were managed by POs called Pamosaingan Farmers and Fishermen Association (PAFAFIA) and Sta. Cruz Farmers and Fishermen Association (SACFFA). These organizations implemented different strategies in managing and protecting the beach and mangrove forest such as recording of reports on illegal cutting of trees and mangroves and sand hoarding. However, 3% of the respondents did not participate in the activities of said organizations due of issues on transparency and dissatisfaction with the management strategies implemented. Despite these, with the majority (97%) of the respondents who are willing to participate in the management and conservation of beach forest, this can be useful in developing programs and formulation of plans to achieve sustainability of beach forest resource utilization. Likewise, proper dissemination of the importance of the ecosystem, its benefits and transparent management strategies should be imposed in order to encourage the local communities to engage into organizations for sustainable management of the beach forest ecosystem.Keywords: Resource management strategies, Sustainable management, Local knowledge, Attitude and perception, Island community

",,,,"Hurricanes are major disturbances with important consequences to stream ecosystems as they create major floods and remove riparian vegetation. Understanding their impacts is a priority, as hurricane intensity is expected to increase due to global climate change.
Mayfly assemblages in streams fill a diversity of ecological roles and functions. They are important consumers of algae by scraping benthic biofilms and detritivores associated with fine particles and leaf litter. Other taxa are filterers and even predators. Mayflies are also important prey items in aquatic and terrestrial food webs.
Here, we assessed the effects of two consecutive hurricanes that impacted Puerto Rico in 2017 to understand how hurricane-induced changes in the environment alter mayfly composition, secondary production and emergence.
The study was conducted in the Luquillo Experimental Forest, Puerto Rico. Mayflies were sampled as nymphs and emerging adults for 6 months before and 17 months after hurricanes Irma and María hit the island in September 2017. Leaf litter inputs, canopy cover and chlorophyll a concentrations were monitored along with mayflies.
Mayfly assemblages were dominated by two genera of Leptophlebiidae before the hurricane, Neohagenulus (two species: N. julio Traver, 1938, N. luteolus Traver, 1938) and Borinquena (one species: B. carmencita Traver, 1938). Both genera decreased in density after the hurricanes and were replaced with the Baetidae Cloeodes maculipes Traver, 1938 as the dominant taxon. This pattern was observed in both nymph and emerging adult densities.
The secondary production of Leptophlebiidae species was highest before hurricane disturbance, with the Baetidae C. maculipes showing the opposite pattern. Neohagenulus had an annual production of 445 mg m−2 year−1, C. maculipes of 153 mg m−2 year−1 and B. carmencita of 68 mg m−2 year−1.
Overall, the mayfly assemblages in our studied stream are vulnerable to hurricane disturbances. Expected increases in hurricane impacts might result in assemblage shifts that could change assemblage composition and alter energy flows within the ecosystem.","0307-6946

Population monitoring through artificial retreat-sites (ARS) was implemented on French’s Grand Rouveau and If islands to study the effects of management measures. We used Generalized Linear Models to identify: (i) the environmental variables (such as substrate, vegetation, and exposure to wind and sun) influencing the maximum number of individuals observed in ARS (studied in both islands); and (ii) the factors influencing ARS daily use (occupancy), including individual attributes such as age and weight, external temperature, and disturbance (Grand Rouveau only). The maximum number of geckos appeared to be determined by the thermal properties of ARS, as mediated by exposure to the dominant wind and sunlight, rather than by the structure of the habitat and nearby vegetation. An individual gecko’s presence in an ARS was positively related to its presence in the same ARS on the previous day and negatively related to its age, the temperature of the previous night, and the number of days of disturbance. These results provide insights into the factors governing the selection and use of ARS by the European leaf-toed gecko and open perspectives on the use of ARS for the monitoring and conservation of this and other elusive terrestrial reptiles.

This study focuses on characterizing the ornithogenic soils of Half Moon Island in Maritime Antarctica, examining how lithology, vegetation, and geomorphology influence their formation and distribution. Fieldwork conducted during the 2014/2015 austral summer included excavating and sampling 21 soil profiles. Soils were analyzed for physical and chemical properties and classified. Half Moon Island's soils are predominantly Cryosols and Leptosols, characterized by little development, high gravel content (skeletic), and significant cryoturbation. High variability in soil chemical properties was observed, with principal component analysis highlighting distinct clusters based on landscape position, geology, vegetation and ornithogenic influence. The findings underscore the diverse pedoenvironments of Half Moon Island, shaped by past and present ornithogenic activity and post-glacial geomorphological processes. This research highlights the soil variability in Antarctic environments and the significant ecological importance of seabird colonies on small, isolated islands.

One of the tasks, that solves this question, is the definition of the geographic range of phages distribution, investigation of their properties and evolutionary characteristics in different climatic conditions. The aim of the survey was to identify the presence of bacteriophages in moss and soil samples, which were taken at the Argentine Islands archipelago, to find structural elements of the virion and evaluate a variety of bacteriophages morphotypes in terrestrial biotope of Antarctica. Мethods: аnalyzed samples moss and soil, selected during seasonal work in 2017 on the Akademik Vernadsky station. The sterile material (5 g) was collected and put into 50 ml 0.1 M Tris-HCl buffer. The filtrate was centrifuged for 2 hours, 90000g (ОPTIMA L-90K (Beckman Coulter)). The sediment from each tube was resuspended in 0.5 ml 0.1 M Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.0). Bacterial cultures were grown on nutrient agar and liquid broth (1.5% and 0.7%). The phages were detected by direct inoculation. The titers were measured in plaque-forming units per ml (PFU/ ml) via Gratia agar technique. The concentrated phage preparations were analyzed by electron microscopy. Contrasting was performed with 1—2% Tungsten Phosphoric Acid, pH 7—7.4. Results: аlso there were made conclusion about the activity of isolated phages. Due to the results of the EM, phages were divided into four taxonomic groups, according to the structural features: the family Podoviridae, C1 morphotypes, order Caudovirales; the family Siphoviridae, B1-B2 morphotypes, order Caudovirales; the family Myoviridae, A1, А3 morphotypes, order Caudovirales. The research revealed, that a phages are sensitive to various bacterial cultures, which differ in morphological and biochemical characteristics. Conclusions: the detection of lithic activity of phages against bacteria (Pseudomonas fluorescens 8573, P. syringae pv. lachrymans 7591 Serratia marcescens sp., Cq13) suggests the probability of the presence of specific mechanisms that allow them to acquire the ability to adapt to new hosts.

For this purpose, the presence data were drawn from the Map of Vegetation Series of Italy. Following some modifications (sigmetum additions and merging) and exclusion (azonal sigmeta and small islands), a presence-absence matrix composed of 20 administrative regions by 224 vegetation series was resulted and, subsequently involved in cluster analysis, indirect ordination and indicator analysis. The administrative regions were partitioned into 12 phytogeographic units (districts), of which six were composed of only one region. Sardinia is the only region not to share any sigmetum with others. The main inferred gradients underlying the sigmetum composition of region were latitude and oceanicity. The subdivision of Italy based on vegetation series is similar to that which would result on the basis of the distribution of vascular planta taxa, if a classification at higher levels of within-cluster floristic similarity were considered. The numerous phytogeographic units distinguished (12) is certainly due to the strong climatic gradients and geomorphologic variation traceable throughout Italy, but their number is probably overestimated as a consequence of some redundancy in syntaxonomic nomenclature. Along with vascular flora, zonal vegetation series demonstrate a reliable predictive power to distinguish terrestrial phytogeographic units.",,,,,,,,,,,,No,,includes Sardinia,,com,,baseline,0.6907756090164184,1,0.3118292782826625,0.6,3,822.0

The Pacific Island region (PIR) is spread over an area of 30 million square kilometers and has around 7500 islands of which 500 are inhabited16. Most island nations within the PIR are isolated from the developed nations and hold some of the most pristine and delicate ecosystems. However, recent studies in Fiji indicate the presence of a group of toxic chemicals known as persistent organic pollutants (POPs) in terrestrial / marine and the
atmospheric environment12. Under the Stockholm Convention, POPs are restricted for production, importationor use and are banned in most developed nations. The Stockholm Convention is a global treaty on elimination of POPs and came into force in May 2004. Fiji was the second country after Canada to ratify the Stockholm Convention, thereby agreeing to formulate a national implementation plan to monitor and control the release of POPs in the country.

",,,,"The nontuberculous mycobacterial pulmonary disease (NTM-PD) caused by Mycobacterium species has increased in prevalence all over the world. The distributions of NTM-PD are possibly determined by the westerly wind traveling at high altitudes over East Asia. However, the long-range transport of Mycobacterium species has not been demonstrated by analyzing the bacterial communities in aerosols such as desert mineral particles and anthropogenic pollutants transported by the westerly wind. Here, airborne bacterial compositions were investigated including Mycobacterium species in high-elevation aerosols, which were captured in the snow cover at 2,450 m altitude on Mt. Tateyama. This was further compared to the ground-level or high-altitude aerosols collected at six sampling sites distributed from Asian-dust source region (Tsogt-Ovoo) to downwind areas in East Asia (Asian continental cities; Erenhot, Beijing, Yongin, Japanese cities; Yonago, Suzu, Noto Peninsula). The cell concentrations and taxonomic diversities of airborne bacteria decreased from the Asian continent to the Japan area. Terrestrial bacterial populations belonging to Firmicutes and Actinobacteria showed higher relative abundance at high-elevation and Japanese cities. Additionally, Mycobacterium species captured in the snow cover on Mt. Tateyama increased in relative abundance in correspondence to the increase of black carbon concentrations. The relative abundance of Mycobacterium sequences was higher in the aerosol samples of Asian continental cities and Japanese cities than in the desert area. Presumably, anthropogenic pollution over East Asia carries potential Mycobacterium species, which induce NTM-PD, thereby impacting upon the public health.","1556-5068

This project addresses the challenge of a new risk to plant health in Europe, the invasion of the Japanese beetle, Popilliajaponica (Newman, 1838) (Coleoptera, Rutelidae) and provides an environmentally friendly IPM Toolbox to control the expanding pest populations across Europe. This study aims to present the records of terrestrial arthropod diversity with a special focus on four groups belonging to Carabids and Staphylinid beetles (Coleoptera), Opiliones and Anisolabididae (Dermaptera), collected with the potential to be used as biocontrol agents against P.japonica in future Integrated Pest Management programmes. A thorough sampling programme was conducted in maize and pasture fields in two Islands of the Azores (São Miguel and São Jorge) in the summer of 2022.We provided an inventory of the arthropods recorded in two Azorean agroecosystems (maize and pasture fields) from São Miguel and São Jorge Islands. A total of ten maize and ten pasture fields were sampled and a total of 360 pitfall traps were installed, 216 in São Miguel and 144 in São Jorge, for seven consecutive days in August and September of 2022.We collected 18559 specimens belonging to the phylum Arthropoda, four classes, twelve orders, twenty-six families and forty morphospecies (two identified at the family level as carabid and Staphylinid larvae and 38 identified at the species level). We identified 38 taxa at the species level (n = 18281). Of the 38 identified taxa, 18 species were predators, 15 were plant feeders and five were omnivores. The 18 predators belong to the following families: 10 species were Carabidae, two Staphylinidae, one Anisolabididae, one Chrysopidae, one Leiobunidae, one Nabidae, one Phalangiidae and one Scathophagidae. Concerning the origin of the predators, we recorded five native species: two Carabidae, one Leiobunidae, one Scathophagidae and one Nabidae. The other 13 predator species were introduced or indeterminate.

","Sparrow, Sage; Hudgens, Brian; Beaudry, Frédéric; Street, Harpst; George, T.; Munkwitz, Nicole",,Population model,,,2011.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Threats to a species' persistence are likely to change as conservation measures reduce some threats, while natural and anthropogenic changes increase others. Despite a variety of potential underlying mechanisms, extinction threats will be manifested through one of the 3 components of population dynamics: reducing population growth potential, increasing population variability, or lowering the population ceiling. Consequently, effective management can be guided by monitoring programs and population models that examine each of these components. We examined the potential for a coupled monitoring and modeling effort to guide management of species-at-risk while accounting for evolving risks using the case study of the threatened San Clemente sage sparrow (Amphispiza belli clementeae). Originally listed due to a low population ceiling imposed by severe habitat loss, we found that the major threat to San Clemente sage sparrow persistence has shifted to low population growth potential driven by high juvenile mortality. We further found that successful mitigation of high juvenile mortality will shift the primary threat to drought frequency, which is predicted to increase on San Clemente Island as a consequence of global climate change. The latter shift is a consequence of the boom-bust ecology exhibited by San Clemente sage sparrows in response to rainfall—likely a common characteristic of short-lived terrestrial vertebrates in arid environments. Our ability to successfully recover this species hinges on a comprehensive monitoring and modeling program incorporating all 3 components of population dynamics informing changes in management priorities to reflect shifting threats. Our study indicates that the next critical step to recovering sage sparrows is to understand and mitigate the causes of high juvenile mortality. In response to these predictions, the United States Navy has funded a radio-telemetry study to determine the cause(s) of juvenile mortalities. © 2011 The Wildlife Society.",,,,,,,,,,,10.1002/jwmg.165,No,,,,pop,,protocol,0.9938822388648987,1,0.002748800094703695,1.0,5,528.0

The Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research (SCAR), a non-governmental committee of the International Council of Scientific Unions (ICSU), promotes and coordinates scientific activity in Antarctica, and coordinates Antarctic research with research in other parts of the world. SCAR's working groups of scientists from time to time organize symposia within their different disciplines. The 8th SCAR International Biology Symposium, held from 27 August to 1 September 2001 in Vrije Universiteit, Amsterdam, mustered over 400 scientists, who delivered concomitant numbers of papers and posters: those who were present recall a very lively gathering. The conference theme reflected SCAR's second field of responsibility — linking Antarctic and worldwide research. These proceedings present 50 selected papers by over 160 contributors from 18 countries. Those in the editorial team are to be congratulated on their masterly presentation of papers, from multilingual sources, in clear and usually impeccable English, and on their insistence on a good index. The introductory paper by Andrew Clarke on ‘Evolution, Adaptation and Diversity: Global Ecology in an Antarctic Context’ outlines the geological and climatic history of Antarctica, stressing its recent dynamism, and comparing Antarctic marine and terrestrial ecosystems with those of other harsh environments around the world. Though much in it has been said before, this is a keynote paper of particular use to readers who come new to Antarctic biology. Of the remaining papers, all but one are grouped under six headings: ‘The Role of Antarctica in Global Patterns and Processes’; ‘Climate Change and Increases in UV-B: Impacts and Responses’; ‘Adaptation and Evolution in Extreme Environments’; ‘Antarctic and Arctic Ecosystems, Poles Apart?’; ‘Biogeography and Biodiversity in Antarctic and sub-Antarctic Systems’ and ‘Antarctic Research, Human Impacts and Environmental Policy’. However, readers in search of a paper on a particular topic would be well advised to concentrate on titles rather than headings. One skimming in search, say, of contributions on Antarctic limnology might miss Ellis-Evans and Bayliss's contribution on carbon oxidation processes in maritime Antarctic lakes, which appears under ‘The Role of Antarctica in Global Patterns and Processes’, in uneasy company with papers on large-whale distribution, algal biomass in pack ice and a research protocol for monitoring vegetation and permafrost. The final paper, ‘Polar Limnology, the Past, the Present and the Future’ by Laybourne-Parry, appears alone under the cryptic heading ‘Outlook’. Similarly a paper on ‘Aphids from Kerguelen and Crozet Islands, Subantarctic’, by Maurice Hullé (France) and 11 others, appears in the section ‘Antarctic Research, Human Impacts and Environmental Policy’, though it is by no means clear that the subjects (all agreed by the authors to be worldwide and polyphagous) were introduced by humans. Again, a paper by Cinzia Verde (Italy) and four others including Guido di Prisco, on evolutionary implications of haemoglobin in Arctic spotted wolffish, appears in the section ‘Antarctic and Arctic Ecosystems, Poles Apart?’, while a related paper by di Prisco on ‘Adaptation and Evolution in the Antarctic: An Exciting Challenge for Biology’, turns up more logically under ‘Adaptations and Evolution in Extreme Environments’. It is difficult to convey the flavour of 50 research papers in a short review, and invidious to single out particular papers for comment. However, di Prisco's paper on adaptation and evolution is of particular interest in indicating a modern research trend affecting Antarctica as elsewhere. A protein biochemist, with particular research interests in nototheniid fish, di Prisco draws attention to EVOLANTA, an eight-year long SCAR programme linking multidisciplinary research on evolution in response to climate change, within which he works. EVOLANTA provides ‘a framework to improve our understanding of the evolutionary history and biology of the unique Antarctic biota (marine, terrestrial and freshwater ecosystems), and to integrate this with knowledge of the climatic and tectonic contexts within which evolution occurs’. This is not the first such umbrella programme to be sponsored by SCAR, but it marks a higher level of multidisciplinarity than BIOMASS and other predominantly ecological programmes in the past. As such, it will demand an unusual, though highly desirable, level of cross-disciplinary understanding in participants. There is clearly still room in Antarctic biology for more traditional approaches in ecology and biogeography. The volume includes papers on endolithic microorganisms and their habitats, pack-ice algae from both polar regions, recent changes in plant distribution (inevitably linked with global climate change), and ecological reports on such old friends as Weddell seals, Adélie penguins, giant petrels, McCormick and brown skuas, and hairgrass and pearlwort, Antarctica's two endemic flowering plants. Links with the main global theme are not always patent, but who cares, if the biology is sound? This well-produced book is strongly recommended to any biologist who seeks to keep up to date on Antarctic ecology or biogeography.

",,"Pensoft Publishers
",,,,"Each fall from 2017 to 2019, entering Honors students at the University of Massachusetts Boston were invited to attend a 2-day retreat on Thompson Island in Boston Harbor, Boston, Massachusetts, USA. As part of this retreat, students participated in a three-hour bioblitz using the iNaturalist platform. The educational goal of this exercise was to allow the students to observe nature and to participate in a Citizen Science project. These students were generally not science majors and had little or no experience with iNaturalist, and yet during 3 years they made over 2000 biodiversity observations, including over 5700 photographs. Using these data, we addressed the question, “Can naïve observers, using the iNaturalist platform, make useful contributions to our understanding of biodiversity?” For those unfamiliar with the iNaturalist platform, it facilitates this process by encouraging its online community of identifiers to provide species names, thus effectively integrating the collection and identification processes. Observer training: A National Park Service educational team gave groups of 50 to 75 students a 20 to 30 minute introduction to bioblitzes, how to take pictures, especially close-ups with mobile phones, and how to use the iNaturalist app. The students then headed out in one- to four-person groups to preassigned quadrants of the island for 2 to 2.5 hours of observations. Evaluation of Observations: iNaturalist evaluates observations with a three category system of “Casual”, “Needs Id” and “Research Grade”. In addition to the iNaturalist ratings we evaluated other characteristics of the observations: We tallied the number of photographs per observation and developed a rubric to score the quality of images as good, OK, or poor. We identified whether or not the observer tried to identify the species being observed, and scored observations as to whether we thought an identification to species or genus was possible. We totaled the number of observations that were identified to the species and genus level by August 1st, 2020. Finally we evaluated the spatial quality of the observations. We tallied the number of photographs per observation and developed a rubric to score the quality of images as good, OK, or poor. We identified whether or not the observer tried to identify the species being observed, and scored observations as to whether we thought an identification to species or genus was possible. We totaled the number of observations that were identified to the species and genus level by August 1st, 2020. Finally we evaluated the spatial quality of the observations. Results: Over 50% of the observations were of plants and 40% of animals, mostly arthropods and mollusks. The remaining 10% were of fungi and seaweeds. A total of 202 unique species were identified from the student bioblitzes. The proportion of species common to each year was 19%. Forty-seven percent of the observations (945) were identified to species level but only 2/3 of these (687) were confirmed by others to make them “research grade”. Fifty-eight percent of the observations included three or four images, and 31% were judged to be of good quality, 54% OK and 15% poor. We thought that the majority of the observations were identifiable to species or genus level (64%), and in 26% of the observations, our expertise was insufficient to be confident of an identification. We scored the final 10% of the observations as unidentifiable. The location data for most of the observations met our expectations in that marine species were located on the periphery of the island and terrestrial species were found over land, concentrated along island pathways. However, we found about 2.7% of the observations did not make it into the official iNaturalist project because of errors in the GPS coordinates, sometimes placing the observation miles away. All observations were made on Thompson Island but 60 different place names were given for the 2000+ observations. Discussion: A year-long biodiveristy inventory of the Boston Harbor Islands using the iNaturalist approach and completed in 2017 found 475 species. The 202 species identified (by students and identifiers) on Thompson Island are a signficant contribution considering the short, late summer sampling period. The short field experience with naïve observers contributes to the relatively low (19%) proportion of species in common among the three years. The students were predictably attracted to species that were easily photographed e.g., did not move or were of the right size. Examples include herbs and shrubs that were flowering or fruiting, oysters, mussels, snail shells, and insects such as butterflies. The instructors encouraged the students to take photographs of the whole organism and its parts, but some images were out of focus or did not capture details essential for identification. We expected that using GPS technology within miles of downtown Boston would lead to precise and accurate species locations and that was what we found. However, the errors associated with an observation can be large, and 2.7% of observations that should have been included in the project were initially not. Conclusions: This bioblitz exercise was designed with an educational objective: to give college freshman from the city the opportunity to observe nature and partake in a citizen science project. We conclude that a short instruction period provided to naïve users armed with a digital native’s expertise usingsmart phones allowed them to collect observations that the iNaturalist community of species identifiers was able to turn into quality biodiversity observations. The students’ observations are building a record that can be mined by scientists to answer a variety of questions.

",,,,"The northward dispersal of thermophilic plants along the East Asia island chain is influenced by cold stress, strait barrier and island effect. However, the impact of each parameter is not clear. In this study, we try to clarify the contribution of the above three effects to the geographical patterns of cold-intolerant climbing plants (vines) within the East Asia island chain. We divided the East Asian region into inland, coastal and island chain belts (Belt I, II and III, respectively), and 13/14 latitudinal regions. Distribution patterns of taxa shared by two adjacent belts were compared. We evaluated the impacts of cold stress effects by comparing the northern-most distribution boundary of vines within the island chain with those on the East Asian mainland and matching average January temperature isotherms. We assessed the strait barrier effect by comparing it with non-strait biogeographic lines. The island effect was assessed by quantifying the percentage of discontinuously distributed taxa. The results showed that: The northern-most limit of 54.3% of genera and 63.2% of species shared by Belts II and III coincided with a strait, with 27.2% of genera and 25.0% of species being discontinuously distributed. Cold stress, island effect and strait barrier effects together explained the patterns of 82.1% of genera and 87.7% of species shared by Belts II and III, which was higher than the value explained by cold stress on the mainland (77.7% and 72.4%, respectively). Cold stress, island effect and strait barrier explained 29.6%, 13.6% and 38.9% distribution patterns of taxa at the genus level, and 25.0%, 16.4% and 46.3% at the species level, respectively. Distribution patterns that could not be explained by cold stress were explained by strait barrier and island effect along the East Asian island chain. The East Asian island chain, especially the Ryukyu Islands, might be an efficient avenue for the northward dispersal of terrestrial plants, explaining the low degree of endemism and prevalence of discontinuously distributed taxa in this region.

","Holland, Glen",,Captive breeding; Captivity; Breeding pair; Flagship Species; Population viability analysis,,,2000.0,,,49,52,,,,,,27,2,"AFA Watchbird
",,"American Federation of Aviculture
",,,,"C aptive breeding is usually one of the last methods employed by conservation authorities but internationally it is increasingly used in the fight to save endangered species from extinction. Captivity is regarded by many as undesirable and some even advocating that a species should rather become extinct than be brought into captivity. Nothing brought this home to me more than a visit to the Californian Condor breeding centre managed by the San Diego Zoo. It was explained to me that the fortresslike appearance of the facility was to protect the birds from extremists who had threatened to kill the birds rather than allow them to be held captive.

Fortunately, however, there has in recent years been an ever-increasing number of success stories which have calmed the objections of the critics of captive breeding. Most recently I have just read that the American Peregrine Falcon, re-established from captivebred birds, has been removed from the threatened and endangered species lists in the USA.

Conservation authorities will most often use the option of translocation of individuals from an established, secure wild population to be used as founder members for a new population. When, however, the wild population is already at a low point and can not safely be harvested to provide sufficient individuals for translocations, captive breeding, which can be initialized with a handful of founder members, becomes an option.

Captive breeding is no longer the hit and miss affair it used to be and the goals of most captive programs are decided on by a recovery group. Captive programs are run - often with expert advice from a taxon advisory group (TAG) - in accordance with a

 

captive management plan, which is part of a species recovery plan and defines the goal of the captive program. The Reintroduction Specialist Group (RSG) is part of the Species Survival Commission (SSC), which is in tum part of The World Conservation Union (IUCN). The RSG have produced guidelines for re-introductions and publish a regular update on some of the re-introduction programs globally.

Single species holdings, high standards of record keeping, husbandry and hygiene, strict disease screening and management protocols, researched release methods, and good post release monitoring are now the accepted code of conduct for captive breeding/release programs.

Captive breeding involves a longterm commitment and is an expensive process. Release sites have to be carefully assessed and seldom is a single

 

release successful in re-establishing a population. Techniques and protocols are usually refined over a number of years and successive releases. Even once a reintroduced population is looking likely to establish, supplementation with captive-bred birds is often required to ensure long-term success.

Once the captive husbandry techniques have been successfully established and documented in a husbandry manual, the next step, and probably the most challenging is to find sufficient safe habitat and to develop successful release methods for the species concerned. Factors responsible for the initial decline of the species have to be addressed prior to releases. These factors vary significantly throughout the world but the most common factors responsible for species declines are human pressure and the resulting loss or fragmentation of habitat and the introduction of alien plant and animal pests.

Another common denominator when looking at endangered species on a global scale is the high percentage of island species, often endemic, which are in dire straits. New Zealand, for example, has lost about 500/o of its terrestrial species, Hawaii 15 out of approximately 50 species and Guam 10 out of 13 species.

Animal pests, which impact on the native species, vary greatly from feral cattle, goats and pigs to monkeys, mongoose, rodents, and mustelids (stoats, ferrets, and weasels), snakes and introduced birds. Some of these introduced species alter the habitat, others compete with native species for food and nests and some prey directly on eggs, nestlings and/or adult birds. The Pacific Rat is on record as being responsible for more species extinctions in the Southern Hemisphere than any other single species or factor.",,,,,,,,,,,,No,,,,"pop, ?",,,0.9379528403282166,1,0.06892027393165623,1.0,5,711.0

Hamilton (editors), 2011, Cambridge University Press, 768 pp. £65 (Hardback) ISBN: 9780521760355; http:// www.cambridge.org/ Tropical Montane Cloud Forests (TMCFs) are gaining in scientific popularity since a first international symposium on this ecosystem was held in Puerto Rico in 1993. The promotion of the meeting by the UNESCO International Hydrological Programme illustrates a far-reaching effect of cloud forests: they act as water collectors for tropical forelands. TMCFs also harbour extraordinarily many plant species, contributing to outstanding positions in each of the five hottest spots of plant diversity. Why edit yet another comprehensive opus on TMCFs, after several previous fundamental works, despite their encompassing under 0.15% of the global terrestrial surface? The answer is clear to those who know this biome: there hardly exists a more fascinating environment than exuberant, moss-covered cloud forests, often called elfin forests due to their mystical appearance. They form highly complex ecosystems, which on different continents show divergent biocœnoses because of their fragmentation and isolated position within distinct tropical mountains in the Neotropics and, to a lesser degree, in the Paleotropics, and in a few cases even on Pacific islands. This book deals with general features of TMCFs (12 chapters) and contains examples from Middle America (21), South America (19), Southeast Asia (10), Africa (5) and Oceania / Australia (5). Most contributions result from a conference in Hawaii in 2004. A first glance reveals a nearly complete thematic spectrum. The book is subdivided into seven sections with a total of 72 chapters. The first part contains general features of TMCFs. Altitudinal distributions are presented in an introductory chapter, though integrative references to surrounding belts are missing. A useful GIS-based modelling approach provides instructive data on TMCF resources and losses including tables on their dimensions and distributions. Interestingly, Indonesia and Congo rank first in national extent, with neotropical countries falling lower down. A climate chapter is based on a dataset of 477 weather stations in cloud forest sites. Many graphs present vast dot clouds of data from stations between 200 and 5,000 m asl, which raises the confusing suspicion that TMCFs occur in regions of extremely dissimilar climates. A short but informative chapter on changes in fog precipitation should have been part of a later section, as also applies to one on epiphytism. Comments on global and local soil variations, as well as on nutrient cycling and limitation in TMCFs, provide convincing and compact estimations. Coloured maps of TMCF distribution highlight their restricted extent and natural fragmentation on a global scale. The subsequent and sadly brief section on regional aspects of floristic and faunistic diversity contains fascinating information from all TMCF- bearing continents. The range extends from research on epiphyte-diversity on solitary trees (up to 4,806 individuals of 114 vascular plant species on one single fig tree!) to potential and actual distribution patterns of the mountain tapir and Andean bear. The only point of criticism is that in a book on a biological realm this section could have been broader. The third section on hydrometeorology covers a broad remit since fog, rain and their interception are decisive triggers for the formation of TMCFs. Several parts display the importance of potential evaporation and irradiation as driving forces for the variable character of forests. Additionally, the degrees of litter mineraliation and soil acidity become crucial causes of ecological peculiarities. The contributions vary from rather specialist methodical content (e.g. measuring interception, usage of stable isotopes for diagnoses of precipitation origins) to comments on the water frontiers of biogeography 4.1, 2012 — © 2012 the authors; journal compilation © 2012 The International Biogeography Society

Coordination of effort, and knowledge sharing are clearly important as are risk assessment methods which attempt to quantify the risk posed by a range of species that are either present or are likely to invade. Great Britain, as an island, has advantages over continental landmasses in that prevention of invasion by terrestrial and freshwater species is more straightforward. However, there is still a large number of detrimental nonnative species present in the country and this is likely to increase.

Objective This study aimed to determine the genetic diversity within and among populations of P. amphibia and the distribution characteristics of each population to investigate insights into the genetic structure and conservation of P. amphibia . Methods In this study, the genetic diversity and structure of 84 P. amphibia individuals from 7 populations in South Korea were analyzed using genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS). We used 2,469 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to analyze genetic diversity, principal components, structure, and phylogeny. Results Our results showed a mean observed heterozygosity and mean expected heterozygosity of 0.34409 and 0.34082, respectively. Genetic diversity analysis indicated that the variation among populations (60.08%) was greater than that within populations (39.92%). Fixation index values, principal components analysis, structure, and phylogeny analyses showed that the population in Gyodongdo, Ganghwa Island was highly different. Conclusion These results provide important insights for better understand the population history and genetic structure of P. amphibia .

Con el uso del programa MaxEnt, se obtuvieron cambios importantes en las áreas de adecuación climática actual y futura de las especies estudiadas. La variable Precipitación del trimestre más cálido fue la de mayor contribución a los modelos para la mayoría de las especies. Las áreas de adecuación climática actual variaron entre las 11 especies siendo en algunas más restringidas a las regiones donde se conoce su distribución real y en otras con una distribución casi pancubana. Las proyecciones hacia el futuro mostraron pérdida del área de adecuación climática actual para todas las especies en los escenarios 2,6 y 8,5 para los años 2050 y 2070.

",,,,"Abstract Endemic rodents constitute 19% of Australian terrestrial mammal species and this proportion is higher in arid zones and the north. We report substantial genetic diversity and population structure in the common rock‐rat, a saxicoline murid whose range extends across northern Australia and into the continent's interior. Samples of 686 individuals from 68 locations, encompassing the western half of the species' range, provide one of the most geographically and numerically extensive genetic studies of an Australian rodent. The Great Sandy Desert, a prominent feature over the last 0.5 my bp acts as a significant barrier to gene flow. Continental islands, formed during the past 10 000 years following the end of the most recent Pleistocene glacial maximum, have populations with lower heterozygosity and marked differentiation from each other and the adjacent mainland. On the mainland, despite considerable differentiation between locations, there is only weak evidence for isolation by distance and where it occurs it is associated with drainage basins. In the Pilbara, analyses of genetic structure within localized sub‐locations, just a few kilometres apart, indicate considerable variation between them ( F ST ) and inbreeding within ( F IS ). We interpret this in the context of cyclonic and other extreme rainfall events that occur episodically, leading to boom‐bust population cycles. Populations decline into refugia of isolated rock patches during extended periods of poor resources with consequent low genetic diversity ( H e ) and large differentiation from others. Populations that irrupt after major episodic rainfall increases resource states, have a more extensive distribution with greater heterozygosity because of gene flow between previously isolated refugia and less differentiation between the locations. These observations have conservation significance for threatened congeneric species and other Australian arid rodents by demonstrating, in this common exemplar, the reduced evolutionary potential imposed by both transient isolation due to climatic variation and longer term disruptions by geographic barriers.

","Sang, Wei",,Eupatorium,,,2005.0,,,,,,,,,,,,"Acta Phytoecologica Sinica
",,,,,,"Eupatorium adenophorum, native to Mexico and Costa Rica of Central America, is a worldwide noxious invasive weed. It occurs throughout many terrestrial areas of the world and is especially rampant in Southeast Asia, Hawaii (U.S.), New Zealand, Australia, and the Pacific Islands. Since its invasion to China from the boundaries of Vietnam and Burma, the speed of its spread has been faster than anticipated, particularly in the southern and southwestern parts of the country. Presently, E. adenophorum can be found in Chongqing, Yunnan, Sichuan, Guizhou, Tibet, Guangxi, Taiwan and Hubei Provinces. A rough estimate of the annual spreading rate of E. adenophorum is about 10-60 km from south to north and from west to east in China. It is considered a threat to local economy and biodiversity. As a result, an increasing number of Chinese scientists have become interested in studying this species and much progress in understanding the biology and ecology of this species has been made to date. In particular, much is known about the underlying mechanisms of its invasion biology.
This paper reviews some of the hot research topics of this invasive species in China, including its distribution, predicting its potential distribution, the mechanisms underlying its invasion and spread, and methods for control and elimination. The distribution of this invasive plant in China has been mapped and its potential distribution has been predicted using a computer model based on climatic factors.
Among current research efforts, understanding the mechanisms underlying its invasion and spread is one of the hottest topics. Recent research also has studied the patterns of genetic variation within populations of the invasive weed, novel biochemical mechanisms of interspecies interactions, biological characteristics of the invasive species that explain its highly successful spread, e.g., small seed size, persistent soil seed bank, high offspring production, potential long-distance dispersal of propagules, vegetative reproduction, relatively high CO2 fixation capacity, shade tolerance, high adaptive ability, and tight link of life-history traits with climatic rhythm.
Although much progress in understanding the biology and ecology of this species has been achieved, there have been no dramatic breakthroughs on how to control E. adenophorum so far. At present, control methods of E. adenophorum are divided into three general categories: manual, chemical and biological control. Biological control is considered the most promising sustainable control strategy for this weed. Several natural enemies and pathogens have been reported that might be able to control the reproduction of this weed, such as Procecidochares utilǐs, Cercospora eupatorii and Alternaria alternata.
The current status of research on the invasive species, E. adenophorum, was reviewed in this paper. Five areas of future research have been proposed: 1) modeling long-distance seed dispersal; 2) allelopathic mechanisms of invasion; 3) ecophysiological adaptations of the invasive species; 4) breeding system of the invasive species; and 5) effective biological control of the invasive species, especially the potential role of genetically engineered fungi.",,,,,,,,,,,,Yes,,,,fun,,inv,0.27278982046991584,0,0.3689884683708535,0.8,1,925.0

In the field, photosynthesis of these poikilohydric organisms might be sensitively monitored by chlorophyll fluorescence. Fluorometric measurements are a part of our long-term research program aimed to the evaluation physiological response to local climate and manipulated warming using open top chambers (OTCs). Within 2007-2009, nine OTCs were established in the Northern part of the James Ross Island in a vicinity of the Czech Antarctic station Johann Gregor Mendel (63 o 50 S, 57o 50 W). The OTCs were installed over typical vegetation cover: (I) moss carpet (Bryum sp.) with several individual spots of lichen, (II) lichens Usnea antarctica and Umbilicaria decussata located on basaltic stones, (III) inicial stages of vegetation succession forming algal biofilms and tiny spots of microlichens on deglaciated stony substrates. Temperature sensors were installed and connected to a multichannel dataloggers. The sensors were put (a) into the height of 30 cm above surface, into the substrate to the depths of (b) 5, (c) 10, (d) 15 cm and also (e) into the surface cover (moss or lichen). Since 2007, the temperature data have been taken in a 30 min step. Additionaly, automatic weather station data recorded in the same interval are used to compare the OTC microclimate with reference outside climate. To estimate photosynthetic processes and physiologically active time in Bryum, several fluorometers were tested and used in the field: (1) modified PAM-210 fluorometer (Heinz Walz), (2) FluorPen FP-100 (Photon Systems Instruments), (3) Moni-PAM (Heinz Walz). The instruments measured effective quantum yield of photosynthetic processes in photosystem II (FPSII) as dependent on hydration/dehydration and microclimatic parameters.

Williams (editors), 2012, Cambridge University Press. 496 pp. £70 (hardback) ISBN: 978‐1‐107‐00130‐5; http://www.cambridge.org After reading this book I regretted having missed the 2009 Southeast Asian Gateway Evolution (SAGE) meeting at Royal Holloway, University of London (UK) on which the content is based. It is clear that biogeographic research is in a new renais‐ sance brought about not only by accumulation of past knowledge, but especially by availability of many new methodologies that help shed light on, and in some cases even solve, some long‐standing questions about Southeast Asia’s complex bio‐ geographic history. The editors have managed to put together a good overview of current research directions and approaches for both the terrestrial and marine realms, based on a multitude of sub‐ jects, including geology, the history of science, pa‐ laeobotany, patterns of species composition and distribution, phylogenetics and modelling of past climates. Reconstructions of plate tectonics and vege‐ tation for the past 60 million years have become better and more detailed, providing important background information for biogeographic recon‐ structions of species dispersal and evolution across the region. However, it is the combination of avail‐ able data sources and methodologies, as exempli‐ fied by many of the chapters in this book, that is currently advancing the field at a rapid rate. Collec‐ tions of species in museums and herbaria can be used to model species’ niches and distributions, while their DNA can be used to construct phylogen‐ ies which can be dated with fossils. This makes it possible to determine where and when taxa evolved, when and how they dispersed across the region and whether and how these patterns are related to geological and environmental changes over time. For plants, my favourite subject, there is now clear evidence that most of the dispersal hap‐ pened from west to east, to such an extent that actually most of the tropical flora of the region, in‐ cluding that of New Guinea and Australia, should be considered of Asian origin. Also, the relatively young age of most of the mountain chains and many of the islands in the equatorial region mean that many floras in the region are rather young, consisting mostly of colonisers from the older re‐ gions, such as Borneo and the Asian mainland. Therefore, reconstructing dispersal pathways, using knowledge of past land configurations, is of prime importance for understanding the biogeography of the region. What I still missed, however, was a thorough analysis of the relationship between dis‐ persal of species across the region and their mor‐ phological, reproductive and ecophysiological traits. Such an approach could provide valuable information on the drivers of the dispersal events. The book ends with a conservation perspec‐ tive, highlighting the dire state the Asian tropics are currently in. I was especially astounded by the scale of the wildlife trade, but also by the continuing lack of ecological responsibility in land‐use develop‐ ment, trade monitoring and environmental law en‐ forcement. It’s a frustrating paradox that, at this time of environmental crisis, when almost no natu‐ ral systems remain and evidence of past bio‐ geographic patterns is destroyed carelessly, our ability to study biological systems is better than ever and developing at an unprecedented pace. Fortunately some signs of ecological responsibility are beginning to develop within the region, brought about by an increasing awareness of the value of the natural world, both ecologically as well as eco‐ nomically, as exemplified by some of the coastal protection projects initiated after the 2004 tsu‐ nami. For anybody interested in the biogeography of the Asian tropics, who wants a quick update of current knowledge and research approaches, this is a must‐read. J. W.

One method that can be done to facilitate policy-making in achieving these goals is to build a web-based food security information system on the basis of a geosmart system. The purpose of this study is to develop a user-friendly information system that provides thematic databases obtained from various sources, particularly remote sensing data, GIS, GPS, and field surveys, with metadata information that has a coordinate system. The development of this system is expected to provide various thematic services on land and land resource information to facilitate visualization, access, and information services in the study area. This study was conducted on a small island of Kaledupa island, in Wakatobi Regency. In addition to biophysical information, it is expected that this system can also provide information services on socio-economic conditions, agricultural commodities, production, agroecology, soil, and crop suitability. The data presented on the website is currently in the form of a thematic map, a plan map in the form of a map of the island’s spatial pattern, and documentation of sampling data. The long-term target of developing this information system is expected to facilitate users and policy makers in Wakatobi Regency in managing land resources, assessing land degradation, and user-friendly agricultural planning in Wakatobi Regency.

The results revealed the prevalence of MPs pollution in the surface seawater and sediment from all studied mangroves during two seasons, where the highest MPs abundance was observed at Sanyahe mangrove. The abundance of MPs varied considerably in surface seawater by seasons and were distinctly modulated by rhizosphere effect. The characteristics of MP also exhibited some pronounced variations across mangroves, seasons and environmental compartments, but the detected MPs were dominated by fiber-shaped, transparent-colored, and smaller-sized (100–500 μm) MPs. The most prevalent polymer types were polypropylene, polyethylene terephthalate and polyethylene. Further analyses revealed positive correlations between MPs abundance and contents of nutrient salts in surface seawater but negative relationships between MPs abundance and water physicochemical properties, including temperature, salinity, pH and conductivity (p < 0.05). The joint use of three evaluation models indicated MPs posed varying degrees of ecological risks to all studied mangroves, whereas Sanyahe mangrove exhibited the highest ecological risk of MP pollution.

1449.0,"THE EFFECT OF NITROGEN FERTILIZATION ON SHORT-TERM FINE ROOT DYNAMICS IN A BARRIER ISLAND DUNE COMMUNITY
","Hutton, John",,Elongation; DNS root zone,,,2001.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Fine root dynamics are an important yet poorly understood component of terrestrial ecosystems. In recent years a number of researchers have focused on fine root dynamics; their work has looked at patterns across one or multiple growing seasons on a scale of monthly measures. The purpose of this study was to add to the overall understanding by looking at fine root dynamics on a shorter temporal scale. Minirhizotron observation tubes were used to assess the effect of nitrogen fertilization on short-term fine root dynamics in a nutrient limited, barrier island dune system. Root length elongation and mortality rates followed expected patterns with soil depth, with the highest values for both occurring in the upper 22 cm. Unexpectedly, soil nutrient analyses did not confirm decreasing nitrogen levels with increasing depth although high variability suggests an inadequate sample size. Total % nitrogen was significantly increased by the fertilization regime and corresponded to significantly higher root elongation and mortality rates. However, mortality rates (0.61 mm cm-2 day-1) greatly exceeded root length elongation rates (0.18 mm cm-2 day-1) in both control and treatment plots. These results support one of the two hypotheses summarized by Hendricks et al. (1993a), namely that fine root turnover rates increase with nitrogen availability. The effect of N fertilization was much more pronounced on mortality rates than on root length elongation rates. This is suggestive of a belowground die back in response to nitrogen fertilization, perhaps associated with a shift in allocation to aboveground production.",,,,,,,,,,,,No,,,,fun,,,0.06418102952884511,0,0.07997667976849791,1.0,0,973.0

Biological invasions, the spread and establishment of species into new regions, have occurred throughout history. Under human influence, however, the rate and spatial scale of invasions have increased to unprecedented levels; they constitute a dominant form of global change. Most invasions cause no discernible impact on the recipient ecosystem, but a small percentage of them (numbering in the thousands and growing) exert significant effects on native biodiversity, ecosystem function, regional economies, and human health. Once introduced into a new region, these high-impact species often show an ability to spread rapidly (i.e., they are invasive). Invasive Species: Vectors and Management Strategies is the first book to focus on the proximate causes of invasions: vectors (modes of transport) and pathways (routes of transport) that transfer organisms. It was developed through contributions from a conference organized by the Global Invasive Species Program—an international, scientifically based effort to understand, anticipate, prevent, and manage invasions. The volume consists of 18 chapters written by 40 authors from seven countries. Despite the diversity of perspectives and regional experiences, the chapters are united by a common premise: if vectors can be controlled, then invasions and their impacts will be reduced. Yet, this is an enormous task. New vectors and pathways are proliferating under the force of international trade, which creates opportunities for species to disperse thousands of kilometers beyond their historical ranges. Owing to these great biological conveyor belts, geographic barriers to species dispersal are becoming increasingly negligible. An ocean is no longer a protective buffer against pests and pathogens residing “far away.” In contrast to the classical concept of biological invasions as being governed by competition and disturbance in the recipient community (Elton 1958), modern concepts emphasize the role of human vectors (MacIsaac et al. 2001). Human vectors not only play essential roles in the large-scale dispersal and (through repeated introductions of colonists) the establishment of most nonindigenous species, they also act as selective filters that ultimately determine what invades the recipient community. These concepts are addressed throughout the book, which is organized into three parts. Part I (nine chapters) is a data-rich compendium of information on vectors and pathways. The first chapter uses a military analogy to argue a complete defense of all points of entry against foreign invaders is impossible; therefore, limited resources must be allocated based on advance knowledge of the most likely vectors (how they will arrive) and pathways (from which direction they will come) and of the nature of the invader itself in order to prioritize impending threats. This is a prelude to later chapters that deal with risk assessment. The author (R. N. Mack) offers many fascinating examples to illustrate the historic role of humans in the inadvertent and deliberate dispersal of plants worldwide. Often transported with plants are disease-causing fungi, many of which are undescribed and become conspicuous only after they cause severe mortality in plant species that have no evolutionary experience with them. This problem is the topic of chapter 2. Other chapters in part I deal with insects, gastropods, freshwater and terrestrial vertebrates, and marine plants. Comprehensive analyses of taxa and geographic ranges are not attempted here. But some common temporal and spatial patterns emerge nonetheless: rates of invasion—regardless of taxon or region—are on the rise and are often exponential; these rates are strongly dependent on human vectors; vectors and pathways determine the composition of exotic species arriving at a given site; and, as the number of sites invaded by a species increases, so do the opportunities that can lead to its further spread. Faced with the myriad invasion opportunities discussed in the first section, one might be discouraged by the enormity of the problem. However, the book offers plans of action. Part II (8 chapters) reviews current invasion management and policies for various taxa and geographic regions (Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, and the United States). Risk-assessment strategies are discussed in three chapters, and probabilistic approaches are illustrated with simple flowcharts and real-world examples (e.g., involving ballast water). Recognizing that invasive species do not respect political boundaries and that international cooperation is therefore required to reduce their spread, there is even a chapter on “environmental diplomacy.” Written from a U.S. perspective, it discusses legal instruments and the emerging social, economic, and environmental trends that will influence future policies. Part III is a single, 46-page chapter that offers an integrative framework for studying and managing invasion vectors. Written by the book's editors (Ruiz and Carlton), this chapter eloquently unites the science and management themes of the book. Here, the authors present a conceptual model that links vector characteristics (e.g., frequency, volume, and speed of transfer) to the probability of species establishment. They discuss factors affecting the “dose-response relationship” between the number of organisms transferred and invasion success. Finally, they propose an adaptive management process aimed at reducing the opportunities for organismal transfer. This process involves an analysis of the invasion history of a given region to identify active vectors and determine their relative contribution to invasions in the region. The results of this retrospective analysis can be used to target the most important vectors, with the aim of disrupting or reducing the flow of organisms in the most efficient manner possible. The efficacy of such management practices can be evaluated by analyses of subsequent invasion patterns. Some minor criticisms can be raised. The book's title, Invasive Species, is misleading because it is used here as a synonym for nonindigenous or exotic (i.e., all species introduced to regions outside of their historic range). The same term is used elsewhere to describe highly successful (widespread) invaders or invaders that have adverse effects on the recipient ecosystem (Colautti & MacIsaac 2004). Data in the book are of variable quality; the time series are not all up to date. On the other hand, there are few redundancies and factual inconsistencies, despite the chapters having been written separately by a diverse group of authors. To its credit, the book uses quantitative rather than anecdotal evidence to inform its audience. There are abundant graphics and tables but no color plates or photographs. Invasive Species is clearly targeted to specialists (graduate student level and upward). With the exception of the final chapter, the book contains little theory, so it would not serve as a course text per se, although it provides a plethora of case studies that can augment lecture material. Nevertheless, this book examines the most important focal points for predicting and controlling invasion threats. It is a rich source of information that will be a valuable reference for researchers, environmental managers, and policy makers.

",,,,"The small Indian mongoose (Urva auropunctata) is a non-native invasive species throughout the Caribbean and the primary terrestrial wildlife rabies reservoir on 4 islands in the region. In the 1970s and 1980s, island-wide attempts to control and eliminate mongoose rabies through culling or poisoning in Cuba and Grenada proved unsuccessful. On some islands, localized population reduction of mongooses is used to mitigate predation on endangered species or to reduce the nuisance and frequency of interactions with humans. However, the short- and medium-term demographic responses of mongooses to local population reduction and the impacts for infectious disease transmission remain unexplored. We conducted an experimental removal of mongooses across a 0.42-km2 area of dry forest in St. Kitts. Employing capture-mark-recapture techniques, we quantified the demographic and behavioral responses of mongooses within the study area. We collected individual-level data using an automated radio-telemetry system, monitoring the daily presence of 19 collared mongooses for 7 months before and up to 7 weeks after experimental removals. The mongoose population density rebounded to pre-removal levels within 7 weeks of the removal, primarily because of the influx of reproductively active females. The proportion of juveniles increased from 1–3% before removals to 14% at 7 weeks after removals yet returned to baseline levels at 6 months after removals. The local immigration of mongooses to the site was evident through changes in capture per unit effort, observed as early as the first week after removals. Tagged mongooses that frequented the study area during the pre-removal period increased their daily presence for 5–30 days after removals. Our results indicate that a localized and intensive mongoose removal program targeting a high-density population has short-term but not long-term residual impacts to the population. Further investigation into contact rates among mongooses and space use among resident and immigrating individuals is essential to advance our understanding of the impacts of localized removals on short- and long-term mongoose population disease dynamics.","0022-541X

",,"BioOne
",,,,"Human–wildlife interactions are projected to increase globally in association with human population growth, expansion of settlements, human access to previously undisturbed areas, and increasing demand for resources. Some of the most expansive and challenging interactions between humans and wildlife will occur in Africa, the continent with the fastest human population growth. This increase in interactions can lead to human–wildlife conflicts over resources, safety, and livelihoods, which can occur on rangelands used for livestock grazing, in farmland, in urban and peri-urban areas, on the fringes of protected areas, but also within protected areas as wildlife, people and livestock cross jurisdictional boundaries to access resources. Balancing the needs of both humans and wildlife is essential for long-term biodiversity conservation. Mitigating human–wildlife conflicts requires robust knowledge of ecological, social, and economic dynamics, and will rely heavily on understanding the patterns, mechanisms, and trends of conflict. While human–wildlife conflicts are expected to grow, conflict patterns will become more complex in dynamic landscapes with shifting land cover and land use, fluctuating intensity of human activities, greater demand for resources, and a changing climate. Highlighting patterns, mechanisms, and trends in human–wildlife conflict as supported by empirical data is required to identify commonalities and to help management decisions and the channelling of funds towards mitigation. This special issue presents original research on human–wildlife interactions from across African terrestrial systems and the terrestrial–aquatic interface, documenting human–wildlife conflicts, and their manifestation, causes and trends. The collection of papers in this special issue not only provides updated scientific information on the human–wildlife interface in Africa, but also emphasizes the vital role of incorporating communities and their perceptions and attitudes in devising conflict mitigation strategies. The contributions are organized into three thematic sections. The first section includes six papers that explore ecological and anthropogenic drivers of human–wildlife conflict. The second section features five papers detailing various approaches and techniques for mitigating these conflicts. Lastly, the third section comprises five papers that investigate perceptions, social impacts, and the effects on human livelihoods associated with human–wildlife conflict. We hope that this special issue will provide valuable insights to facilitate human–wildlife coexistence initiatives in Africa and around the world. Human–wildlife conflict represents a complex interplay between ecological processes and human activities. Animals depend on access to essential resources, including water and seasonal habitats, which often require extensive home ranges and frequent movement across landscapes. However, human land use and infrastructure increasingly disrupt these movements, forcing animals into human-dominated areas like settlements and farmland. This not only threatens the connectivity of less disturbed wildlife habitats but also poses significant risks to human safety and livelihoods. This section explores the multi-faceted drivers of such conflicts through six studies spanning different geographical contexts and species. Taken together, these studies illustrate the interconnectedness of ecological and anthropogenic factors in human–wildlife conflict. Tiller et al. (2024) highlight the importance of wildlife pathways in maintaining landscape connectivity and mitigating human–wildlife conflict, focusing on elephant Loxodonta africana movement between protected and agricultural areas in the Masai Mara, Kenya. The study revealed that pathway use by elephants peaked during the dry season, with elephants adopting risk-avoidance strategies to minimize human encounters. The study also showed that frequently used pathways were near farms and forests, correlating with higher incidents of crop raiding, and emphasizing the need for strategic management to balance habitat connectivity and conflict mitigation. Schmied née Stommel et al. (2024) investigated how dry season water availability, reduced by upstream agricultural activities, affected the distribution of ungulates in Ruaha National Park, Tanzania, highlighting that different species exhibit varying distances from water sources based on their dietary needs. The study found that grazers stayed closest to water, while omnivores maintained the largest distance, aligning with predictions about species' resilience to anthropogenic reduction in surface water. A study by Kral et al (2024) in Botswana's western Kalahari found that cheetahs Acinonyx jubatus adjusted their activity patterns according to the presence of livestock, becoming more crepuscular on cattle farms, perhaps in connection with livestock activity. In contrast, cheetahs were more nocturnal on game farms, possibly in connection to different perception of human-induced mortality risk. The study highlighted how land use, livestock presence and anthropogenic risk may influence carnivore behaviour, suggesting management strategies like temporal zoning of grazing and night-time cattle enclosures to mitigate human–wildlife conflict. Bhardwaj et al. (2024) examined wildlife mortality caused by railway collisions in Balule Nature Reserve, South Africa. The study found that mammals were most at risk during the dry season, amphibians during the wet season, and that the majority of rail-kills occurred in mixed shrublands. The findings underscore the necessity of implementing mitigation measures in high conservation value areas to minimize the impact of railways on local wildlife. Mossad et al. (2024) studied the impact of anthropogenic land cover on waterbird communities along the Nile in Egypt, using bird census data and satellite imagery. They found that landscape characteristics at larger spatial scales explained more of the species' and guilds' presence than smaller scales. Species richness decreased with increased urbanization, particularly affecting waders and red-listed species. The results stress the importance of assessing species-specific responses to human disturbance at multiple spatial scales for effective conservation planning. Coelho et al. (2024) assessed the impact of traditional shell-fishing on migratory shorebirds in the Bijagós Archipelago, Guinea-Bissau. They found that shellfish resources for shorebirds were better managed in areas with formal protection, while traditional management based on cultural beliefs resulted in poorer stock conditions. Shell-fishing peaked during mid-winter, potentially disturbing shorebirds, but declined during the birds' critical fuelling period, easing direct competition for food. The study also showed minimal indirect effects of sediment disturbance, with a slight reduction in prey density but no significant effect on the available biomass for shorebirds. This section includes four papers that evaluate various technical as well as strategic approaches for reducing human–wildlife conflicts. Montero Botey and Perea (2023) explored the use of infrared barriers to detect African savannah elephants in southern Tanzania, finding that the technology reliably detects adult elephants but has limited effectiveness for subadults. The barriers also detected giraffes and large vehicles, suggesting potential applications for both human–wildlife conflict mitigation and anti-poaching efforts. The results suggest infrared barriers as a cost-effective early-warning system to help reduce human–elephant conflicts. Cook et al. (2023) evaluated four methods to protect large trees in South Africa's Greater Kruger National Park from elephant damage, finding that beehives were the most effective, reducing tree mortality substantially, though they come with higher costs potentially offset by honey production. Concrete pyramids also proved effective if placed at a sufficient radius, while wire-netting helped against bark stripping but not more severe damage, and creosote jars showed limited effectiveness. The findings offer a practical toolkit for managers balancing efficacy and cost to mitigate elephant impacts on key savanna trees. A study by Mayengo et al. (2024) highlights the declining populations of the sitatunga Tragelaphus spekii antelope in Africa due to habitat loss, fragmentation, hunting, and other threats, questioning the effectiveness of current wildlife management approaches. The authors advocate for a shift to ecosystem- and landscape-level strategies, better wetland management, and inclusion of human dimensions in conservation planning. Emphasizing non-invasive techniques for genetic monitoring and fostering positive local attitudes toward wildlife are suggested as essential steps for sustainable sitatunga conservation. Twahirwa et al. (2023) examined population trends of large herbivores in Rwanda's Volcanoes National Park, finding notable increases in buffalo Syncerus caffer and bushbuck Tragelaphus sylvaticus densities and minor increases in elephants and black-fronted duikers Cephalophus nigrifrons between 2008 and 2021. The authors attributed the recovery of these species to the conservation efforts focussed on mountain gorillas Gorilla beringei beringei. Overall, herbivore densities have significantly rebounded since a sharp decline in the late 20th century, demonstrating the broader positive impact of protective measures within the Virunga montane ecosystem. The remaining five papers in this special issue used social science approaches to address different aspects of the human dimension and to explore what is needed to achieve sustainable coexistence between humans and wildlife. Ayalew and Melese (2024) examined the impact of human–wildlife conflict on local livelihoods and wildlife conservation around Alitash National Park in Ethiopia, finding that over half of surveyed households experienced crop damage, primarily from species like common warthogs Phacochoerus africanus, African porcupines Hystrix cristata, and common baboons Papio cynocephalus. Livestock losses were also significant, and while attacks on humans were rare, they still generated negative perceptions and resentment toward wildlife. The study suggests that addressing conflict through alternative livelihoods and context-specific conservation strategies, alongside continuous education, could help mitigate the adverse effects on both local communities and wildlife conservation efforts. Tickle et al. (2024) assessed strategies for sustainable coexistence between people and the growing elephant population in Zimbabwe's Hwange National Park, where elephant numbers exceed management goals and contribute to human–wildlife conflicts. Stakeholder feedback showed support for increasing CITES export quotas and local community benefits, including meat and tourism opportunities, with both culling and regulated hunting suggested as management options. The findings underscore the need for balanced approaches that ensure elephant conservation while meeting local community interests. Fabiano et al. (2024) studied human–wildlife conflict and livelihood dynamics in Angola's Iona National Park, where semi-nomadic residents face threats to livestock and crops from various wildlife species, including leopards Pathera pardus, cheetahs, and Chacma baboons Papio ursinus. Findings reveal overstocking issues and differing perceptions of species-related risks, emphasizing the need for conservation management that balances ecosystem capacity with community needs. The research provides critical baseline insights to guide community-based resource management strategies in arid landscapes like Iona, fostering sustainable coexistence between people and wildlife. Aglissi et al. (2023) assessed local community attitudes toward the reintroduction of lions Panthera leo in Côte d'Ivoire's Comoé National Park following their extirpation due to civil war. Results indicate strong community support for lion reintroduction, with many seeing benefits outweighing risks and expressing willingness to coexist with lions again. Acceptance was influenced by factors such as profession, perceived benefits, and current management practices, underscoring the importance of inclusive, participatory approaches in conservation efforts to ensure community involvement and benefit-sharing. Finally, Marker et al. (2024) evaluated the impact of an outreach program aimed at reducing human–wildlife conflict in four communal conservancies in Namibia, finding that workshops significantly decreased livestock losses and improved local perceptions of predator populations. The workshops helped participants better understand predator ecology, which contributed to more accurate perceptions and effective mitigation of livestock depredation. The results highlight workshops as a valuable strategy for promoting conservation awareness and supporting sustainable livelihoods in communities affected by human–wildlife conflict. The studies presented in this special issue provide a comprehensive overview of the complex dynamics that underpin human–wildlife conflict and the evolving strategies aimed at fostering coexistence in African landscapes. From the ecological and anthropogenic patterns and drivers of conflict to the diverse mitigation methods and the critical role of community engagement, these findings underscore the importance of multi-faceted, context-specific approaches that seek to balance the needs of both humans and wildlife. One of the key insights from this collection of studies is the importance of landscape connectivity in mitigating human–wildlife conflict. Tiller et al. (2024) demonstrate that maintaining wildlife corridors is crucial for species such as elephants, which are forced to traverse human-dominated landscapes to access seasonal resources. However, these corridors also bring wildlife into conflict with agricultural activities, as seen in the Masai Mara, Kenya, where elephants' risk-avoidance behaviour leads them into crop-raiding hotspots. Similarly, Kral et al. (2024) and Schmied née Stommel et al. (2024) highlight how human land use, such as livestock farming and water management, alters wildlife movement determining occurrence and activity patterns, and exacerbates competition for resources. These studies collectively point to the need for integrated land-use planning that accounts for both wildlife habitat requirements and human livelihoods. Another critical takeaway is the role of seasonality and habitat specificity in shaping conflict dynamics. For example, Bhardwaj et al. (2024) emphasize how seasonal variation in wildlife mortality due to railway collisions calls for targeted mitigation measures during high-risk periods. Similarly, the study by Mossad et al. (2024) underscores the necessity of understanding the broader landscape context, as urbanization and anthropogenic disturbances impact species distribution, particularly along vital migratory routes. These findings suggest that temporal and spatial dimensions of human–wildlife conflict need to be carefully considered in management strategies, with particular attention paid to the seasonal and habitat-specific needs of wildlife. The studies on mitigation techniques also present valuable examples how innovative, practical solutions can be integrated into conservation efforts. Montero-Botey and Perea (2023) show how infrared barriers could offer a cost-effective tool for early detection of elephants, which could reduce human–elephant conflict in southern Tanzania. Similarly, Cook et al. (2023) present evidence of the effectiveness of beehives in protecting trees from elephant damage, a solution that simultaneously offers economic benefits through honey production. These practical interventions highlight the potential for non-invasive strategies to address human–wildlife conflict, providing valuable tools for managers working in resource-constrained settings. Despite the promise of these strategies, the human dimension of the conflict remains crucial. The studies that focus on local perceptions and social impacts, such as Ayalew and Melese (2024), Fabiano et al. (2024), and Marker et al. (2024), highlight that mitigating conflict goes beyond ecological and technical solutions. Understanding community attitudes and involving local people in decision-making and co-designing mitigation measures are pivotal for the success of conservation strategies. As seen in the case of the lion reintroduction scoping study in Côte d'Ivoire (Aglissi et al. 2023), communities that feel engaged and benefit from conservation initiatives are more likely to support wildlife conservation efforts. Similarly, educational initiatives, such as the outreach program in Namibia (Marker et al. 2024), have proven to significantly improve local perceptions of predators and reduce livestock losses. These findings emphasize that any successful conflict mitigation strategy must incorporate social considerations, address local concerns, and foster positive relationships between people and wildlife. Lastly, the importance of adaptive, ecosystem-level management strategies is highlighted in Mayengo et al. (2024), who advocate for a more holistic approach to conservation that incorporates human dimensions and broader landscape management. Furthermore, these studies demonstrate that human–wildlife conflict is not only a challenge for conservation but also a critical issue for human well-being. The losses of livestock and crops, as described in Ayalew and Melese (2024), have direct economic and social consequences for local communities, particularly in rural and peri-urban areas. Therefore, conservation strategies must be designed with an understanding of the socio-economic context, including the livelihoods of affected communities. As Tickle et al. (2024) suggest, creating opportunities for local people to benefit from wildlife – whether through tourism, sustainable harvesting, or meat from management interventions – can help ensure that wildlife conservation contributes to human well-being. The findings from various studies in this special issue emphasize that effective conflict mitigation requires ongoing research, adaptive management, and strong collaboration across stakeholders, including local communities, conservationists, and policymakers. In conclusion, the studies presented in this special issue demonstrate the complexity of human–wildlife conflict in Africa and provide a range of measures that incorporate both ecological insights and human dimensions. As human–wildlife interactions continue to increase, especially in regions of rapid human population growth and land use change, a combination of landscape-scale planning, technological innovations, and community engagement will be essential for reducing conflict and fostering sustainable coexistence. The lessons drawn from these studies have significant implications not only for Africa but also for other regions facing similar challenges of human–wildlife conflict worldwide. – Contributions to this special issue were invited by Bogdan Cristescu and Ezequiel Fabiano, who also handled most of the submissions through the review process, helped by regular members of the editorial board of Wildlife Biology.

",,,,"Ever since I was “knee-high to a grasshopper” I wanted to be a biologist. Well, not exactly, at first I wanted to be a park ranger, but a supportive sister and outdoorsy dad changed this so that as my love and knowledge of nature matured, I knew I wanted to be a wildlife biologist; Mother Nature's guidance never wavered in me. However, the road I took was anything but straight. My meander to fulfill my passion has been characterized by serendipitous experiences and filled with caring mentors and brilliant colleagues who readily gave their knowledge and expertise and bestowed upon me a modicum of skill that enabled me to become a wildlife biologist. My journey began at the University of Wisconsin-Parkside where I was taught by some of the most erudite educators. A cross-country motorcycle ride and a short stint at a private zoo later, I was accepted into Humboldt State University where I was surrounded by like-minded students whose passion for wildlife was both unparalleled and infectious. Similar to when I was at UW, I was again taught and inspired by a fine cadre of professors. During my graduate studies, I landed my first wildlife job as a hack site attendant for a bald eagle reintroduction on Santa Catalina Island, California. While there, I was introduced to the island's top terrestrial carnivore, the island fox. I fortuitously met my future Ph.D. advisor, Dr. Robert Wayne, from UCLA, while trapping foxes on San Clemente Island. My Ph.D. initially focused on the autecology of island foxes on San Clemente Island, but funding snafus prevented me from working there, so I regrouped and began studying foxes on Santa Cruz Island, an island with an established population of feral pigs. My research centered on monitoring radio-collared foxes and for the first nine months not a single fox died, but over the next 16 months, their cumulative survival plummeted. The carcasses had telltale signs of raptor predation: De-gloved limbs, tendrilous fibrils of left-over tissue, holes in their pelts and skulls, and the perpetrator infrequently left behind evidence of its presence that alighted on the surrounding grass: feathers. Golden eagles were killing island foxes! At first I thought this was a rare occurrence as golden eagles were historically transient visitors to the islands, but this was not a short-lived phenomenon. One day, I made an observation and linked it to two influential papers (Holt 1977, 1984) that enabled me to put two-and-two together. While driving to my study site, I flushed a golden eagle that had a full crop. I then saw a carcass on a hillside and went to investigate. But I did not find a fox, rather a small piglet. Its entire viscera, heart to entrails, all of its ribs, and vertebrae were consumed. The pelt had talon holes and other signs similar to fox carcasses. It was then that I made the mental leap to apparent competition. Pigs were facilitating the decline in foxes by supporting a recently colonized golden eagle population that had a disproportionate impact on the foxes. Without my connection to the research of my predecessors, I am quite certain that my discoveries would have been delayed or perhaps never realized. Now, others, like Jon and his cohort of students, are building upon such previous investigations, making important discoveries of their own, and helping to preserve critically functioning ecosystems.

","Gloser, Jan; Barták, Miloš",,Thallus; Carbon sink,,,2002.0,,,3,4,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Lichens and mosses are the most conspicuous and biologically important elements of terrestrial ecosystems of maritime Antarctica. Their principal role in carbon and nitrogen acquisition, cycling, and in soil formation processes is generally accepted, but detail knowledge of their functioning in field condition is still fragmentary. Growing interest in such research is also motivated by potential use of the vegetation responses for detection of expected long-term climate change in polar regions. The presented results are based on measurements of carbon dioxide fluxes (net photosynthetic uptake, respiratory output) in stands of fruticose lichens (mainly Usnea aurantiaco-atra and U. antarctica) and several species of mosses, which formed closed stands in the surrounding of Peruvian Base situated at the Crepin Point (Admiralty Bay, King George Island, South Shetlands). Evolution of CO2 from newly formed soil under moss carpets was also monitored. The selected plant or soil samples were periodically covered by a transparent plexiglass cuvette. Short-time changes in CO2 concentration within the cuvette were measured using a portable infrared gas analyser. In addition to the measurements of diurnal courses of CO2 exchange, several experiments focused on single-factorial dependence of carbon fluxes on irradiance, plant temperature and hydration, were done. Highest diurnal carbon gain of fruticose lichens was recorded on overcast days with low temperatures (close to zero) and with high air relative humidity (above 80%), particularly when the lichen thalli were moistened by trapped snowflakes. During sunny days, the diurnal carbon balance was seldom positive, not only due to rapid drying of the thalli, but also due to their temperature-induced high respiratory losses. Separation of the relative importance of the two crucial factors was possible by simultaneous measurements of CO2 exchange in intact and in artificially moistened lichens. Prevailing overcast weather with snowing episodes even during Antarctic summer seems to be very favourable for the lichen performance. In addition to the functional traits, some morphological peculiarities of the Usnea antarctica and U. aurantiaco-atra (dense, hair-like structures in the upper part of their thalli functioning as very efficient snow traps) are probably much helpful for survival and abundance of these species at exposed places (perpendicular rocks, stony ridges). Carbon fixation rates (calculated both per area or per plant biomass unit) were much higher in mosses than in lichens, and were less sensitive to the diurnal variation in air humidity. On the other hand, large amount of the newly fixed carbon was lost in respiratory processes, and also long-term carbon balance of moss stands was diminished by microbial decomposition of dead plant parts.",,,,,,,,,,,,No,,,,"trait, fun",,,0.7988129694014787,1,0.3907852654488244,0.8,4,778.0

","Jaelani, Lalu; Liou, Yuei‐An",,Photosynthetically active radiation; Enhanced vegetation index,,,2010.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Net Primary Productivity (NPP) was known as an important index for evaluating the carbon cycling in forest ecosystem. For tropical forest purpose, due to large area and lack of ground measurement data, we use remotely sensed data to estimate three important parameters of NPP such as light use efficiency (LUE), fraction of photosynthetically active radiation absorbed by vegetation (FPAR), and photosynthetically active radiation absorbed by vegetation (PAR). Basically, the Monteith equation [5] is used to model aboveground NPP in the tropical forest. Rahman et al. [7] proposed a micrometeorological model for estimating continuous field‘‘LUE of terrestrial vegetation using MODIS Photochemical Reflectance Index (MODPRI) from the MODIS ocean bands. FPAR is calculated from Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) [2]. PAR is calculated from 0.45 % of incoming shortwave solar radiation (Rs) [4]. In this study, we use data from MODIS in 2000 to 2006 and comparing the result with MODIS17 of NASA Product. The results show that the estimated value for the distribution of NPP over Kalimantan Island by this methods and MODIS17 product were 1185.215 gC/y (2000), 1451.867 gC/y (2001), 1214.269 gC/y (2002), 1294.533 gC/y (2003), 1153.011 gC/y (2004), 1198.719 gC/y (2005), 1224.175 gC/y (2006); 2979.933 gC/y (2000), 3027.867 gC/y (2001), 2884.167 gC/y (2002), 2951.167 gC/y (2003), 2884.250 gC/y (2004), 2921.600 gC/y (2005), 2923.725 gC/y (2006), respectively.

",,"BioMed Central
",,,,"Abstract Species identification within the aphid genus Pemphigus Hartig, 1839 poses challenges due to morphological similarities and host-plant associations. Aphids of this genus generally exhibit complex life cycles involving primary hosts (poplars) and secondary (mostly unrelated herbaceous) host-plants, with some species relying solely on root-feeding generation. An example is a representative of the genus Pemphigus , trophically associated with grass roots, found in the High Arctic Svalbard archipelago. Historical records tentatively identify it as Pemphigus groenlandicus (Rübsaamen, 1898), although its formal classification remains elusive, due to limited material of freshly collected samples. Recent collections from 2007 to 2024 across various Svalbard sites, revealed its presence under stones in sheltered microhabitats, providing valuable specimens for comparative studies. Our molecular analyses indicate that the Svalbard specimens are not a separate species commonly identified as P. groenlandicus , nor an anholocyclic generation of Pemphigus bursarius (Linnaeus, 1758) or P. borealis Tullgren, 1909, but represent a secondary generation of Pemphigus populiglobuli Fitch, 1859, the Nearctic poplar bullet gall aphid. This suggests that they may have lost their primary host associations and adapted to living on grass roots year-round. Our specimens did not host any known facultative symbionts; however, we detected a strain of Pseudomonas Migula, 1894, closely related to a cold-tolerant bacterium abundant in polar regions. The present study also investigates the taxonomic relationships and morphometric characteristics of grass-feeding Pemphigus populations across the Arctic and an isolated locations on the European continent. Specimens from Svalbard were compared with samples from Greenland and Iceland, but identified no substantial morphometric differences among these geographically separated populations. Similarly, analyses of samples of Pemphigus groenlandicus crassicornis Hille Ris Lambers, 1952 from Sweden and Spain reveals a high morphometric similarity to the Arctic population, indicating a strong link between these traits and geographical variability. Despite the limitations in fresh material availability across locations, minor morphometric variations and shared ecological niches (all populations studied inhabiting grass roots, a unique trait within the Pemphigus genus) suggest treating both P. groenlandicus and its subspecies crassicornis as a junior synonym to P. populiglobuli . The study also demonstrates that the secondary generation of P. populiglobuli is a terrestrial microarthropod that overwinters in a postembryonic life-stage in situ in soil and vegetation under harsh Arctic conditions, and its cryptic life complicates its distribution mapping.

1480.0,"Microbial lipid distribution and substrate potential of the organic matter interrestrial Siberian permafrost deposits from NE Siberia
","Stapel, Janina; Mangelsdorf, Kai; Schirrmeister, Lutz; Horsfield, Brian; Wagner, Dirk",,Thermokarst,,,2016.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"The investigation of microbial ecosystems in permafrost sediments is an important approach to understand the role of microbial organic matter transformation in permafrost sediments for past and future climate changes, and is of high relevance in today’s geoscience research (Wagner, 2008) due to the current debate on the temperature vulnerability of permafrost deposits. Especially, the interplay between the organic substrate and the distribution of the living and past microbial communities in Late Pleistocene (Yedoma) and Holocene permafrost deposits, as well as the substrate potential of the organic matter stored in potentially thawing permafrost deposits are in the focus of the current study. Our investigation is part of the BMBF CarboPerm project an interdisciplinary Russian-German cooperation on the formation, turnover and release of carbon from Siberian permafrost landscapes. Sample material derived from terrestrial permafrost cores drilled at the coast of Bour Khaya in the North-Eastern Siberian Arctic. The gathered core material comprises Late Pleistocene to early Holocene deposits separated by an ice wedge. The microbial life markers (intact phospholipids, PLs) prove the presence of currently living microorganisms in the entire permafrost sequence and show the highest concentration in the uppermost sample indicating an abundant microbial life in the active layer. In comparison, the PL profile is strongly decreased in the underlying permafrost deposits. Nevertheless, the inventory of the Phospholipid fatty acids (PLFAs) suggests that the cell membrane temperature adaptation to cold environmental conditions is mainly regulated via the ratio between iso- and anteiso-fatty acids (FAs) as well as the ratio between saturated and unsaturated FAs. The surface samples show higher proportions of anteiso and unsaturated FAs (adaptation to cooler conditions), which might derive from the fact that surface layers are more affected from the harsh Siberian winter conditions than the deeper constantly cold permafrost deposits, where the above-ground temperature extremes are buffered due to the overlying deposits. Indeed within the deeper permafrost sequence the variations of the ratios are rather small, indicating adaptation to similar constantly cold temperature conditions. Other microbial markers (GDGTs), already partly degraded and, therefore, not indicating microbial life, reveal similarities with the TOC content and an increase especially in Late Pleistocene deposits. This suggests increased microbial life during intervals in the Late Pleistocene presumably caused by periods of moisture and temperature increased environments. Pore water analysis reveals the presence of low molecular weight organic acids (LMWOA) such as acetate, being excellent substrates for microbial metabolism. In the Late Pleistocene deposits below the ice wedge the substrate depth profiles show significant similarities to the TOC content. These points to a link between the organic matter and the LMWOA concentrations solved in the pore water and to the potential of those permafrost layers to provide substrates for microbial greenhouse gas production. In contrast, in the active layer the LMWOA concentrations are low, reflecting an active microbial turnover in the surface layers. Ester cleavage experiments on the residual organic matter resulted in the release of ester linked LMWOAs forming a potential substrate pool when released in future. These bound LMWOA profiles are even better correlated to the TOC content suggesting that the deeper permafrost deposits (older organic material)are not significantly different from those in the surface sediment (fresh organic material). Overall this indicates that the organic matter stored in the permafrost deposits and, therefore, removed from the surface carbon cycle is not much different in terms of organic matter quality than the fresh surface organic material. Considering the discussed increase of permafrost thawing, this might imply a strong impact on the generation of greenhouse gases from permafrost areas in future with its feedback on climate evolution. In a second and ongoing study, four terrestrial permafrost cores spanning from the Eemian interglacial into the Holocene form Bol’shoy Lyakhovsky Island are investigated with the focus on the differences and potential of the organic matter by comparing Eemian, Late Pleistocene and Holocene deposits. First results already reveal similar relations between the living and dead microbial communities with respect to the availability of free substrates, and the quality and amount of the total organic carbon. The results on the future potential of these deposits will also be presented.

","Fritz, Michael; Wolter, Juliane; Rudaya, Natalia; Palagushkina, Olga; Nazarova, Larisa; Krautblatter, Michael; Obu, Jaroslav",,Ice wedge; Thermokarst; Aggradation; Ice core,,,2015.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Ice wedge polygons (IWP) are amongst the most typical permafrost phenomena in Arctic lowlands. Within the northern hemisphere, IWP are thought to occupy between 250,000 km² (Minke et al., 2007) and 2,600,000 km² (Mackay 1972) of the tundra and boreal forest, which accounts for 3 to 31% of the arctic land mass including glaciated regions. Besides the wide spatial distribution, IWP have stored large quantities of organic carbon and nitrogen on geological timescales and are therefore regarded as greenhouse gas sinks. Continuous organic matter accumulation and preservation due to syngenetic permafrost aggradation make arctic polygon mires an excellent climate and environmental archive. Here we present the results of a multidisciplinary palaeoenvironmental study on IWP in the northern Yukon, Canada. High-resolution laboratory analyses were carried on a permafrost core together with the overlying active layer (233 cm length) which was drilled in 2012. Based on 14 AMS radiocarbon dates spanning the last 5,000 years, we report high-resolution ground ice stratigraphy, stable water isotopes (δ18O, δD), sedimentary data including grain size distribution and biogeochemical parameters (OC, N, C/N ratio, δ13C), as well as pollen and diatom assemblages. This is accompanied by high-resolution remote sensing data based on airborne LIDAR and on underground investigations using electrical resistivity tomography in different resolutions. The studied low-centered IWP indicates that the whole IWP field was established after a shallow lake had drained at about 3200 cal BP. The diatom assemblage in the lower part of the sedimentary record is dominated by planktonic and pioneer species and by those preferring alkaline conditions. Ice-wedge cracking in water-saturated sediments started immediately after lake drainage and led to the formation of a polygon mire. Downward closed-system freezing of the talik is indicated by continuously decreasing δ18O (δD) values, a δ18O/δD-regression-slope below the Global Meteoric Water Line and a negative relationship between δD and D excess. On the one hand, pollen assemblages in lake sediments have captured a regional signal of vegetation composition and climate. On the other hand, we assume that after lake drainage the pollen record represents a very local signal as it is dominated by the local plant communities growing in the IWP. Therefore, we suggest that the ability to infer regional climate information on temperature and precipitation is good for lake sediments but weak for the overlying peat record. This is indicated by a sudden dominance of Cyperaceae pollen after the transition from lake sediments into terrestrial peat of the IWP. Other IWP along the mainland coast of the Yukon suggest a high temporal diversity in polygon mire origin and behavior. IWP beyond the late Wisconsin glacial limit are mostly high-centered with strong signs of degradation. Coastal cliff exposures with deeply thawed ice wedge surfaces and secondary or even tertiary IW generations support this view. Ice wedge casts dating back until 8,400 cal BP (Fritz et al., 2012) indicate previous periods of ice wedge degradation and meltout. Intermediate forms of IWP (neither low-centered nor high-centered) dominate the mainland coast of the Yukon on the rolling ground moraines. Glacial outwash plains at the former glacial border host mostly low-centered IWP. On Herschel Island, we find many generations of IW and corresponding sedimentary records in the centers although IWP are not as frequent on the high-relief endmoraine, which is Herschel Island, than on the relatively flat mainland coast of the Yukon. Holocene IWP have mostly a surficial expression whereas the older late Wisconsin/Pleistocene/glacial IWP are often buried under a 0.7 to 1.5 m thick sediment cover. Higher than modern summer air temperatures, presumable during the Holocene thermal maximum, caused deeper thaw and led to a truncation of late Wisconsin/Pleistocene/glacial IW. This suggests that remote-sensing based estimations of arctic-wide IWP coverage will give conservative numbers as buried IWP systems will remain invisible.

",,,,,,"The application of newer remote sensing methods, such as aerial and terrestrial lidar scanning and the use of ""Structure-from-motion"" (SfM) photogrammetry, complemented field data collection and enabled 3D mapping of forest fuel layers, greatly simplifying and improving their characterization. However, these methods are not suitable for quantifying forest floor characteristics. For this purpose, it is still necessary to collect data using classical field methods, determining the presence of subhorizons and their depth, while the characteristics of the forest floor: bulk density, load, carbon concentration and carbon stock are determined in the laboratory. Therefore, it is still common practice to create regression equations that allow operatives to determine the amount of available forest floor fuel and the carbon stock it contains based on the depth of the forest floor, which is an easily measurable variable, or to determine forest floor loading by subhorizon and overall. Forest floor information is used in models for predicting forest fire behavior and spread, in fire effects models, in planning and monitoring mechanical fuel reduction, in quantifying fuel consumption and smoke emissions, in quantifying carbon stocks, in describing habitat and its productivity, and in planning for preparedness. As stands of holm oak (Quercus ilex L.) and pubescent oak (Quercus pubescens Willd.) are located in the Mediterranean part of Croatia, where the risk of forest fires is the highest, and the previously published data on the forest floor are not suitable for the models, the main objectives of the research were to determine the depth, bulk density and load of individual subhorizons of the forest floor and to create regression equations that allow estimating the amount of available fuel in the forest floor based on its depth. Sampling of forest floor in holm oak stands (60, 90 and 100 years old) was conducted on the islands of Lastovo and Mljet, while sampling in pubescent oak stands (53 and 90 years old) was conducted in Dugopolje and Biograd na Moru. The amount of forest floor and OC stock in old stands of holm oak and pubescent oak is twice as small as in old stands of Aleppo pine and Dalmatian black pine. This suggests that pine stands have a significantly greater amount of potentially available fuel in the forest floor and are therefore potentially more at risk from fire, but also that they store twice as much carbon in the forest floor. In this study, for the first time in Croatia, bulk densities of individual subhorizons of the forest floor were determined for holm oak and pubescent oak and regression equations were created that allow estimating the amount of available fuel in the forest floor based on its depth per subhorizon and overall. The results of this research have practical value in simpler quantification of forest floor fuel loading, which is important for operational use of models to predict forest fire behavior and spread, but they can also be used in other models mentioned earlier.

Yet, applying these methods at national scale to verify and improve the National Inventory Report (NIR) and support the Paris agreement remains at the frontier of CO2 science.

We use inverse modelling to estimate New Zealand’s carbon uptake and emissions using atmospheric measurements and model. This effort is part of a five year CarbonWatch-NZ research programme, which aims to develop a complete top-down picture of New Zealand's carbon balance using national inverse modelling and targeted studies of New Zealand’s forest, grassland and urban environments. In addition to quantifying New Zealand’s carbon emissions on a national scale, we also focus on identifying the prevailing processes driving CO2 changes in New Zealand to support climate mitigation.

In an initial study based on the inversion system used in CarbonWatch-NZ, a significantly stronger (30-60 %) sink was found relative to the NIR (Steinkamp et al., 2017), suggesting a strong CO2 uptake in Fiordland, a region covered by indigenous temperate rainforest in New Zealand's South Island. Here, we present new results of CarbonWatch-NZ by expanding the studied time period from 2011-2013 to 2020, expanding our atmospheric observing network from two (Baring Head, 41.41°S, 174.87°E and Lauder, 38.33°S, 176.38°E) to a total of eleven in situ greenhouse gas measurement sites and improving our atmospheric model resolution by roughly a factor of ten (NAME model, 1.5 km).

Our new results suggest that the strong sink observed in 2011-2013 did not diminish, but for recent years we have found an even stronger sink than for before. Additional measurements collected in the Fiordland region (i.e., mixing ratios, CO2 isotopes, carbonyl sulphide) also suggest a stronger CO2 uptake, supporting our inversion results. Both the measurements and inversion results show that the CO2 uptake does not seem to shut down completely during winter time, suggesting that there might be something about this ecosystem that we do not yet understand. This winter uptake signal is also present in independent data collected in and around New Zealand as part of the ATom campaigns (Atmospheric Tomography Mission).

",,,,"The book ""Impact of Agriculture on Soil Degradation II: A European Perspective,"" edited by Paulo Pereira, Miriam Muñoz-Rojas, Igor Bogunovic, and Wenwu Zhao (2022), presents a comprehensive examination of soil threats that impact the properties and functioning of agricultural soils in Europe. It is crucial for readers to understand the context of these threats, particularly by considering the definition of land degradation provided by the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD): ""Land degradation is the result of human-induced actions which exploit land, causing its utility, biodiversity, soil fertility, and overall health to decline."" This definition captures both known and emerging soil threats and underscores a topic of growing concern amid the intensification of climate extremes, increasing food demand, and land sealing due to logistics and urbanization. These factors have escalated over recent decades and demand attention as critical components affecting densely populated territories and rural areas that tend to be abandoned. Unlike unmanaged soils formed through natural processes, agricultural soils exhibit much higher spatial variability due to human management practices, which can, in turn, exacerbate soil threats. Across its 12 chapters, the book provides detailed analyses of soil degradation threats in 10 single countries and two multicountry case studies, offering a comprehensive perspective on the most critical issues facing soil sustainability. The book covers the most crucial soil threats at present times. In the majority of cases, the chapters are supported by relevant (country-related) peer-review literature, including the primary driver of climatic conditions, tillage, land use changes, loss of organic carbon, erosion, compaction, overgrazing, salinity, contamination by chemicals and microplastics, structure loss, fire, acidification, flooding, and landslides (Figure 1). A substantial portion of the book is dedicated to elaborating on general concepts of soil degradation, including erosion caused by water and wind, as well as policies aimed at mitigating these effects. It also delves into the changes in soil physicochemical properties and their change over time due to cultivation practices, which are crucial for understanding soil degradation as a significant threat and for developing strategies to adapt and remediate, where possible, to halt further soil degradation. The book is well-presented, featuring informative and helpful diagrams, plots, and figures that succinctly summarize results from scientific peer-reviewed literature. Policy reports and directives are thoroughly referenced, adding to the resource's reliability. Each chapter begins with an introduction that provides a historical overview of agriculture, land conditions, and their impacts on soil traits within a specific country. These introductions highlight the most prominent or well-documented soil threat in the country under discussion. While the structure of each chapter is consistent, which aids the reader's comprehension, there is room for improvement in harmonization. Introducing the concept of each specific soil threat within the broader context of European soils could be advantageous before delving into country-specific research and remediation efforts on agricultural soils. The chapters cover a wide range of soil degradation issues, with diverse examples and in-depth analyses of soil processes, such as salinization in Croatia, Italy, and Hungary, erosion in Germany, Greece, and Portugal. In the Czech Republic, specific processes like soil structure loss, the impact of wildfire, flooding and waterlogging are examined. In Hungary, landslides are discussed, and Iceland presents a country-scale model to assess and monitor anthropogenic degradation. However, a comprehensive quantitative overview of the overall impact on the main physical and chemical properties of soils across Europe and their variability would have been a valuable addition. Several chapters offer detailed explanations of the methodologies used to model soil erosion, measure soil compaction, and assess the impact of inorganic fertilizer loads. They describe the potential effects of soil degradation and include data collection methods for monitoring, spatial representation, and presentation of results with aggregated statistics using NUTS2 level regions. These regions serve as units for policy application and are governed by Regulation (EC) No. 1059/2003, which ensures the consistency of regional statistics over time. The joint chapter on Greece and Portugal exemplifies how experts from multiple countries can collaborate using the same dataset for regional assessments. Out of 10 chapters, soil contamination from chemicals (critical issue in agro-ecosystems) is addressed extensively. The chapter on Germany discusses diffuse pollution from heavy metals, while those in Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania focus on organic pollutants. Slovenia's chapter delves into industrial pollution aspects. These sections cover the primary pollutants of concern, their sources, dynamics in soils, and the factors influencing their concentrations, as well as methodological and legal/regulatory aspects. A summary table of typical concentrations for the most common pollutants in each chapter would be a beneficial supplement. Furthermore, two chapters present zonal statistics derived from the European Soil Data Centre (ESDAC) dataset, based on LUCAS soil module, illustrating pan-European studies adapted from the ESDAC database (esdac.jrc.ec.europa.eu). The loss of organic carbon is a recurring theme throughout the book, yet it is only examined in depth in two chapters. Overall, there seems to be a limited focus on soil biological properties, which could be attributed to the scarcity of data available at the time of publication. Consequently, these biological aspects of soil degradation are not as prominently represented as other threats. Soil erosion is explored in several chapters from different perspectives. The chapter on Ukraine addresses fewer soil threats compared to others, and the ongoing conflict's impact on agricultural soil risk assessment is noted as a topic that would deserve a dedicated sub-chapter in future editions. Chapter 3 underscores the significance of soils in achieving the UN Sustainable Development Goals SDGs, and then narrows its focus to the interplay between agricultural production and economic factors. There is, however, further potential for integrating soil threats monitoring within the framework of the SDGs. Chapter 11 provides a thorough review of the issues associated with overgrazing and the challenges that may arise from the cessation of grazing, such as bush encroachment. This chapter goes beyond agricultural soils, offering clear explanations of remediation processes and techniques. Although the focus is not exclusively on urban soils, a few relevant examples are mentioned. The chapter also discusses regulatory issues concerning contaminated soils, drawing comparisons across different countries. Each chapter of the book concludes by addressing key topics of importance for both urban and societal challenges, including urban agriculture, climate change, soil protection, and land planning. The inclusion of a final glossary of terms is a thoughtful touch that enhances the book's utility. The comprehensive incorporation of peer-reviewed articles and national monitoring initiatives across all chapters positions the book as a valuable resource for environmental managers. While many publications of this nature claim to be accessible to students, certain sections of this book are highly technical and depend on a solid understanding of soil physics, chemistry, and scientific methodology. Despite this, the book provides a detailed overview of soil science aspects pertinent to the recognition and analysis of soil threats, in alignment with cutting-edge scientific literature. Although some sections may lack country-specific information, often relying on EU datasets to summarize soil conditions, this could reflect a broader need for research in these areas rather than a limitation of the book itself. In summary, the book appeals to a diverse readership, including early career researchers, soil science students, and specialists from other disciplines involved in environmental monitoring. In the context of the book review introductory chapter, it is worth mentioning the legacy of the methodologies developed for the assessment of land degradation, the MEDALUS (Mediterranean Desertification and Land Use) project. MEDALUS started in the late 1980's as part of the European Union's research programs to address environmental challenges in the Mediterranean region; being developed in the early 1990's, the input data needed for both natural and socioeconomic factors can now be easily retrieved. But it is still not used for country and continental scales (European Commission 1994; European Commission Directorate-General for Research and Innovation 1999). Several other books and book sections investigate the land degradation and desertification topic either as monographic volumes (Imeson 2011) ""Desertification, Land Degradation, and Sustainability"" which can provide a technical overview of the phenomena at a global, regional, and local scale with a focus on human component mainly for scholars and professionals, and (Barrow 1994) with ""Land Degradation, Development, and Breakdown of Terrestrial Environments"" in which land degradation is characterized in the major biomes and processes are presented for university classes and technicians. Or as a compilation of several case studies and various topics for a large audiences (Zdruli et al. 2010) ""Land Degradation and Desertification: Assessment, Mitigation, and Remediation,"" or by specifically targeting assessment of land degradation in a land cover system (Panwar et al. 2022) ""Land Degradation Neutrality: Achieving SDG 15 by Forest Management,"" to mention a few. Additionally, a recent perspective paper by Chaplot (Chaplot 2021) highlights that the mining of nutrients by soil bacteria, contributes to the depletion of soil organic matter and multifunctionality, exacerbating land degradation and climate warming. Regarding the decision of the authors to focus on some particular threats, although soil sealing is a threat that affects all the countries considered in the book, given the agricultural context, should have taken into account the expansion of agricultural facilities and related infrastructures that, given the context in which we live, grow in a very limited way, the same applies to floods and landslides. As a further remark, in an island, land cover change has been considered since the settlement (second half of the ninth century). Sweden's paragraph on the prohibition of slash-and-burn agriculture sounds a bit odd in the present-day EU configuration, but it is still a land degradation process in place that serves as a monitor for the EU and nearby regions; the landscape we have inherited has been highly shaped by these practices and the protection of natural remnant and extensive complex vegetation communities must not be seen as a high sensibility to the environment conservation or hyper protection but just as the right start to offset climate trends. For future editions, it may be beneficial to consider each country individually. It would also be advantageous to clarify terms such as ""unsustainable practices"" and to base the quantification of the impact of agricultural practices on meta-analytic findings, as opposed to localized studies that may only depict specific, extreme conditions. While the book briefly mentions SDG 15, Target 3.1., which has been investigated at the EU level by (Schillaci et al. 2022), it does include essential discussions on chemical pollution and microplastics in each chapter. This approach broadens the analytical scope and emphasizes these issues significance and societal implications for human health. Data sharing is not applicable to this article as no new data were created or analyzed in this study.

",,,,"In 2012, as Zoology Curator for the University of the West Indies Zoology Museum (UWIZM), based at the St. Augustine campus in Trinidad and Tobago, I ran the first ever bioblitz to be held in Trinidad. Since then, an event has been conducted annually. Each event is organised mainly by staff and students in The University of the West Indies (UWI) Department of Life Sciences alongside members of the Trinidad and Tobago Field Naturalists' Club (TTFNC). A typical event would follow this basic format: choose a new location each year, find a basecamp, set up a search area (usually a 5 km radius circle), promote the event, organise survey teams, start surveying on a Saturday, invite the public along on a Sunday to get involved and then announce the results. Over the years, the bioblitzes have been attended and/or assisted by more than 30 groups and organisations. These included long-established bodies such as the Asa Wright Nature Centre, the Pointe-a-Pierre Wildfowl Trust, and the Zoological Society of Trinidad and Tobago; government bodies like the Institute of Marine Affairs, the Forestry Division and the Environmental Management Authority; and newer, smaller groups such as Trinibats, Turtle Village Trust, Environmental Research Institute Charlotteville (ERIC), the Reptile Conservation Center Of Trinidad and Tobago and The El Socorro Centre for Wildlife Conservation (ECWC) (Fig. 1). The way these groups contributed to the events varied from being basecamp hosts to providing animal encounter experiences, and from granting access to land and giving permits to providing expert wildlife surveyors. Organisations were usually approached by me with an invitation to join a bioblitz, depending on the needs and location of the event. Sponsors for the events were found by writing to local companies, approaching those who already had community funding programmes in place. I left the role of UWIZM curator in 2019, but the Trinidad and Tobago Bioblitz continued and evolved. In 2019, it followed the same pattern as previous events: the organisers partnered with a local school for a basecamp and the usual participants surveyed and welcomed the public. However, in 2020 with the first COVID lockdown, they had to adapt and so changed the bioblitz into an event facilitated online by using the iNaturalist platform: T&amp;T Bioblitz 2020 Backyard Edition. At this stage, people were restricted to their gardens or streets so observation opportunities were limited, but nevertheless there were around 6,500 observations made of almost 1,400 species over one weekend in November. In 2021, restrictions were still in place for large gatherings but people could travel more widely, so the same online format was repeated. Observations could be made in some of the locations of previous events, which led to 2,900 observations and just over 1,000 species. For 2022, the event stayed online but became the Inter-Island Bioblitz as it went regional with participants from Jamaica and Barbados being invited. Almost 600 people took part and recorded over 1,300 species. Finally, in 2023, the bioblitz returned to the original format and an in-person event was again possible; this continued into 2024. The recording of results changed over the years. For example, the use of iNaturalist went from 9 observations in 2012 to over 6,500 observations in 2020. As I was no longer resident in Trinidad, I couldn't take part directly but though iNaturalist, I could contribute by identifying observations, as could many other international identifiers. The majority of records made during the events were observations rather than the collection of specimens, but for some groups it was necessary to collect for further identification. Specimens collected were mostly terrestrial invertebrates, although sometimes roadkill and other specimens found dead during the events were also added to the UWIZM collections. After each bioblitz, a large banner was produced showing a summary of the results (Fig. 2). These were displayed at subsequent events and also as part of other displays in the UWIZM. Likewise, the trails and quizzes made for the bioblitzes were often used during the rest of the year for school groups visiting the UWIZM. Both in the lead up to a bioblitz and in the weeks following the event, the results are promoted in several ways: on social media (Facebook at first and later Instagram and Twitter), in national newspapers, on TV (usually getting a slot on a morning show), and through the TTFNC's Quarterly Bulletin, the final edition of the year being dedicated to that year's bioblitz. A T&amp;T bioblitz website was made, which allowed us to collate all these outputs as well as access to the final reports for each event. Bioblitzes are fantastic events that bring together naturalist experts and the public. They should be a part of any natural history museum's repertoire, helping to promote and popularise the museum, as well as often providing a first exposure of citizen science to people, which can lead to a lifelong connection with nature (Fig. 3).

",,,,"In the summer of 1992, George Demas could be found wading through water in Sinepuxent Bay, Maryland. He and some colleagues were examining soils in tidal marshes and on small islands in the bay. At times, they had to get out of the boat and push it along. As they walked along the material on the bay bottom, they began to notice differences. In some places, the material was soft or muddy while in other areas, it was sandy. Patches of eelgrass grew here and there. As a soil scientist, Demas began to wonder why they had only been examining soils in the marshes and on the islands. Why weren't they looking beyond those places into the bay itself? The obvious answer was because that material wasn't soil. Up to that point, material submerged in shallow water was considered sediment. It wasn't classified or studied as a soil. But the materials Demas and his colleagues were walking on varied like soil and many of them had vegetation growing in them like soils. So why weren't they considered soils? Intrigued by the question, Demas collected some samples of the materials on the bay bottom and took them back to the lab. As he studied the samples and thought more about the definition of soils at the time, he became more and more convinced that these submerged materials should be studied and classified as soils. But as he began to talk to others about this new idea, he was met with some resistance. “George wasn't to be dissuaded, though,” says SSSA Fellow Martin Rabenhorst, a professor at the University of Maryland who would later be Demas's graduate adviser. “He published a paper in 1993 in Soil Survey Horizons, and he mentioned this concept of underwater soils, submerged soils he was calling them.” With his idea published, Demas convinced Rabenhorst that pursuing these submerged soils would make a good doctoral dissertation project. Demas began mapping and sampling the soils of Sinepuxent Bay. In these submerged materials, he was looking for evidence of soil additions, removals, transfers, and transformations—the four components of the theory of soil genesis. He found evidence of all of them. The processes common to the generation of soils on land were also generating the underwater materials in the bay. It became clear through Demas's work that classifying and studying underwater materials as soil could provide multiple benefits to the environments in which he was working. Restoration plans and efforts to restock these areas with vegetation and shellfish were popular at the time. Demas made a clear case for how understanding the soils would benefit restoration efforts and help conserve valuable resources. The findings of his dissertation work were impressive and far-reaching. George Demas “George received the Emil Truog Award, which is the Soil Science Society of America's award for doctoral dissertations,” Rabenhorst explains. “His [dissertation] was a great piece of work, and it really launched things from a soil perspective.” The observations Demas made and his continued efforts to rework the definition of soil lead to a modification of the definition in the 1998 edition of Keys to Soil Taxonomy. The new definition included soils under shallow water, typically less than 2.5 meters deep. Submerged soils, or subaqueous soils as they are more commonly called now, had a place in the world of soils. Sadly, Demas passed away in December of 1999. But with the important groundwork he laid, other soil scientists were quick to enter new areas of research in both estuarine and freshwater subaqueous soils. With this uncharted territory came the need for new techniques to study these soils that were difficult to see unlike subaerial, or terrestrial, soils.

Bottom: Along with the fish finder, readings from tidal gauges are used to correct for changes in tides. Photo by Mark Stolt. “That's the big challenge, right? When you're walking along a subaerial landscape, you can see everything,” says Rabenhorst, who uses the preferred term “subaerial” for terrestrial soils. “But one of the first major challenges when you move into the subaqueous environment is that what you can see is limited.” The first challenging step in studying subaqueous soils is mapping. Soil scientists want to get a picture of the terrain underneath the water by creating bathymetric maps, just as topographic maps are created for subaerial soils. And while the equipment used to create bathymetric maps has improved, technology was limited in the 1990s. During that time, the Department of Defense was scrambling GPS signals as a security measure. Soil scientists hoping to use GPS to map subaqueous soils had to buy expensive units left over from the army. “At the beginning of each day, it would take about 20 minutes to upload the descrambling signals from the satellites,” Rabenhorst explains. “Once you got that, though, you could collect data that was good within a meter in real time out on the water.” Now, with better technology available, the equipment necessary for creating bathymetric maps is much cheaper. A simple fish-finding unit can provide water depth measurements and location information simultaneously. “You can basically use a fish finder to measure the distance from the top of the water column to the subaqueous soil interface,” says SSSA member Mark Stolt, a professor at the University of Rhode Island. “You just drive the boat, and every 10 seconds or so, it takes a reading.” While this process is now fairly straightforward in freshwater areas, there is another variable in estuarine systems—tides. With tides going up and down, the measurements from the top of the water column to the soil underneath can vary at different times of the day. So along with the fish finder, readings from tidal gauges are used to correct for changes in tides. With these data, scientists are able to map the subaqueous terrain and create a picture of the landforms underwater. The landforms that can be visualized from the bathymetric maps help scientists delineate landscape units. Attributes of the landscape such as slopes and surface shapes help describe the boundaries of landscape units such as flood tidal deltas or washover fans. And once these landscape units are defined, soil samples can be collected to see how the soil types align with the different landforms. “We can recognize the landscapes, and then we run transects for sampling,” Rabenhorst explains. “We cut across the gradient or across the landforms to see how the soils change systematically. This is the way we do it in the uplands too.” Adds Stolt, “For the most part, soils will follow those lines, just like they do in subaerial soils.” Actually sampling the soils can be done in multiple ways depending on the characteristics of the soil and how much analysis the scientists want to do. If the soil is soft and fluid, a Macaulay peat sampler can do the trick. This sampler is a fast, efficient way to get 50- or 100-cm increments of the soil profile. With a push and twist in the soil, a half core of soil can be collected. The next increment can be collected simply by pushing the sampler down further. The researchers can then lay out these individual pieces of the profile and look at them immediately. If the soils to be sampled are dense or sandy, or if researchers plan to do detailed analysis on the sample, a vibracore is often used. The aluminum irrigation pipe used to collect the sample must be long enough to pass through the water and go into the soil profile to the desired depth. The vibracore vibrates the pipe allowing it to be pushed into the soil. By topping off the pipe with water and capping it, a vacuum is created. When the pipe is removed from the soil, the sample stays in the pipe, and the researchers have an intact soil profile. “You can take the pipes and split them in half with some shears,” Stolt says. “And there you've got your profile in front of you just like it is underwater.” Without being able to directly observe them, the mapping, collection, and analysis of subaqueous soils can be time-intensive and difficult. The water creates an extra barrier to the study of such soils compared with subaerial soils. But sometimes an unexpected event allows researchers to actually see the soil under the water. One such event occurred in Rhode Island at Trustom Pond. Top: Vibracore soil sample. Photo by Martin Rabenhorst. Bottom: An area of bouldery Napatree soils exposed following the breach of Trustom Pond in South Kingstown, RI. Photo by Jim Turenne. In October of 2012, Hurricane Sandy hit the east coast of the United States. Trustom Pond is a coastal freshwater pond with no man-made inlet or outlet. But as Hurricane Sandy hit the coast, Trustom Pond overwashed and breached. The water drained from the pond through the newly made outlet, and water levels dropped 5 to 6 ft. For Jim Turenne, Rhode Island assistant state soil scientist, the drained pond provided a unique opportunity. Much of the soil that was underwater when he mapped it in 2007 was now exposed, allowing Turenne, an SSSA member and Certified Professional Soil Scientist, to check his maps and directly see the soils. “It was actually like being able to drain a pond and map it that way,” Turenne recalls. “I spent a day out there just walking the pond and getting profile descriptions and good photos of the area. It was an opportunity to dig a hole and not just vibracore to collect some data.” While few scientists will have opportunities to observe subaqueous soils as Turenne did in Trustom Pond, reliable procedures and techniques can now be used to study soils underwater. The processes used to study subaqueous soils are similar to those used for subaerial soils, but what about the soils themselves? Subaqueous soils are similar to soils found in marshes or some flood plains, Rabenhorst says. From a geological timeframe, subaqueous soils are young and weakly developed. The soils may be only 100 or 200 years old, or sometimes up to 2,000 years old, still young from a soils standpoint. Because these soils are young, they rarely have significant B horizons, which develop over time. “You have A horizons that form, and in certain circumstances, you might see some weak B horizons, but then they go into mostly C horizons,” Rabenhorst explains. “But the horizons are distinct and distinguishable.” Stolt led an effort to develop new taxa to classify these soils, and the 11th edition of the Keys to Soil Taxonomy, published in 2010, included two new suborders. These are Wassents and Wassists, which correspond with subaqueous Entisols and Histosols. Below these suborders are great groups and subgroups into which Wassents and Wassists are further divided based on characteristics of the soils. The presence of sulfides, the texture of the soils, and varied horizons within the soil all help scientists classify these subaqueous soils as they have done for years with subaerial soils. And in more fully classifying the soils, both researchers and practitioners can better tie soil type to possible soil uses. Subaqueous soil profile. Photo by Mark Stolt. Subaqueous soil uses, or interpretations as they are called by soil surveyors, can include conservation projects, restoration efforts, basic ecosystem services, and infrastructure support. A better classification system for subaqueous soils helps us all understand the importance of these soils and the services they can provide. In fact, NOAA now recommends the subaqueous soils approach when interpreting the use and management of shallow subtidal soils. “We can do a soil survey like we do on all the upland landscapes,” Rabenhorst says, “and then we can figure out all the marvelous interpretations we can make once we get that soils information.” The tie between soil classification and use was clear to Demas back in the 1990s. And it only becomes increasingly important as more people move to the coasts and as our coastal waters become even more valuable resources. For example, knowing the characteristics of the subaqueous soils used to support docks and other structures people build along the coasts is crucial when determining if those structures will be secure. Another example of how classification can help manage these soils is seen with dredging. Dredging of subaqueous soils is commonly done to deepen waterways and replenish beaches. However, sulfides, which can accumulate in these soils, can cause problems. When sulfide-containing soils are dredged and placed on subaerial soils, the sulfides oxidize and lower the pH of surrounding soils. These soils then become uninhabitable for both plants and animals. Such problems can be avoided if sulfide-containing soils are mapped and characterized. A somewhat unseen, but increasingly important, service provided by subaqueous soils is carbon sequestration. As climate change concerns and atmospheric carbon dioxide increase, scientists have become more and more interested in sinks and sources of carbon. Stolt recently published a paper in which he and his co-authors found that different subaqueous soils sequestered carbon at different rates among various landscape units. Average rates were equivalent to those seen in subaerial forest soils. “Clearly one of the services these soils provide would be carbon sequestration,” Stolt states. One of the more obvious benefits of understanding subaqueous soils, and one that Demas championed from the beginning, is their role in estuarine restoration. Estuarine managers are charged with restoring the health of these aquatic environments, and while water quality has often been considered and addressed, the underlying soils have been overlooked. “Re-establishing submerged aquatic vegetation in these areas is a very expensive process,” Rabenhorst says. “You're talking about maybe $50,000 per acre to plant these. If you put them in soils that aren't well suited for their growth, that's a waste of a lot of money.” Re-establishment of vegetation, such as eelgrass, on appropriate soils can go far to benefit the aquatic ecosystem and restore that environment. With eelgrass come many other organisms that depend on the grass, and therefore, on the soils.

Bottom: In many areas, the quality of the aquaculture and the number of shellfish that can be supported are greatly affected by the soils. Photo by Graham Siener/Flickr. “Eelgrass is important for harboring lots of aquatic animals,” Stolt explains. “Finfish, crabs, scallops, and so forth come into these systems and live in the eelgrass meadows. The soil is supporting the aquatic plants, and the plants are harboring very important parts of the estuarine ecosystem.” In addition to vegetation restoration, shellfish aquaculture and leasing are environmental and financial resources in many areas. The quality of the aquaculture and the number of shellfish that can be supported are greatly affected by the soils that are there. In addition to harvesting the shellfish for profit, the presence of oysters, clams, or scallops can benefit water quality. They filter a lot of water, removing nutrients and other compounds that come into the estuarine systems. Knowing which soils will best support those organisms is vital to their success. “These types of questions may be typically asked in subaerial areas. Do we grow this crop or that one? Do we manage it this way or that way? These are not questions that had been asked from a soils perspective in aquaculture,” Stolt says. That soils perspective is what Rabenhorst hopes soil scientists can continue to bring to studies of estuarine ecology. And he is quick to recognize the extensive work that benthic ecologists have done in this area of study. Rabenhorst has developed collaborations with benthic ecologists and encourages other soil scientists to work in interdisciplinary teams. He hopes that enhanced dialog among soil scientists, ecologists, and marine geologists will provide a more complete picture of what's happening in these subaqueous systems. “There's nothing comparable to a comprehensive soil survey,” Rabenhorst says. “I think that is the main contribution we're bringing into this system—a pedological perspective.” Stolt agrees that soil scientists can, and should, approach these environments from their distinct angle. It's an angle that has been used for years in subaerial environments and the angle that Demas took as he brought the definition of soil underwater. “We have a unique approach as soil scientists to mapping out our resources and using those maps to help manage,” Stolt says. “How can we best manage these estuaries, lakes, or ponds but also conserve what's there? We're trying to classify the resource that's out there so we can do a better job of both managing and conserving it. It's really not different than what is done in a subaerial system.”

Furukawa Agric. Exp. Stn., **Exp. Farm, Grad. Sch., Tohoku Univ. (Jpn. J. Soil Sci. Plant Nutr., 77, 507–515, 2006) The application of organic matter to arable land is important in promoting soil fertility. Excessive application of organic matter, however, causes adverse effects on the nutrient condition of the soils and ground water pollution. We propose subsoil application of cattle manure composts (CMC) to strongly acidic andisols in which elongation of crop roots are inhibit, since CMC have ameliorate ability of acid injury soil. It's probable that the CMC have a slowly decomposing character when mixed with water treatment residuals (WTR) containing aluminum (Al). Aluminum cattle manure composts (AlCMC) having a slowly decomposing character were expected to have an organic sequestration effect when they were applied to subsoil. This study was carried out to confirm the nitrogen and carbon mineralization characteristics of AlCMC, and also the effect of AlCMC application on soil chemical properties and sorghum growth. 1) Incubation at 50 after mixing CMC with WTR accelerated oxidation of manganese ion (Mn2+) which is otherwise harmful to plants. Exchangeable manganese decreased to one-tenth of the initial amount over ten days. The available phosphorus in CMC was fixed by Al contained in the AlCMC (containing 50% WTR) and decreased to 33% of that in CMC. Exchangeable potassium in CMC was not fixed by AlCMC. 2) The carbon dioxide (CO2) emission from CMC mixed with WTR was compared with the sum of CO2 emissions from unmixed CMC and WTR. When the mixing rate of WTR–CMC was 1–1 or 1–2, CO2 emission decreased to 87% or 71% respectively of that from the unmixed treatment after 86 d. The nitrogen mineralization in the 1–1 mixing treatment after 70 d decreased to 75% in comparison with the unmixed treatment. 3) The acid soil used in the pot culture experiment was ameliorated. Soil pH increased to more than 5.7. The available phosphorus after the pot experiment was lower in the AlCMC treatment compared with that of the CMC treatment. The exchangeable manganese was sufficiently low to prevent harm. The cation exchange capacity increased after treating with Al compost. 4) The applications of the AlCMC increased the dry matter of sorghum compared to non-treated compost, owing to soil acidity amelioration. Sorghum growth in the AlCMC treatments was equivalent to that of CMC treatment. In conclusion, the rate of the mineralization of carbon and nitrogen, and the amount of available phosphorus of CMC was suppressed by mixing with WTR. Application of AlCMC to soil improved soil acidity, cation exchange capacity and soil nutrient status. Key words: acid soil, cattle manure compost, phosphorus fixation, suppressed mineralization, water treatment residuals Trends in nitrogen flow since the 1980s in the food and feed system in Japan Kenjiro ODA, Natl. Inst. Agro-Environ. Sci. (Jpn. J. Soil Sci. Plant Nutr., 77, 517–524, 2006) Nitrogen flows five-year intervals during for the period from 1982 to 1997 were estimated by “Domestic Nutrition Balance Estimation System” that represents the flow of production-processing-consumption-disposal of foods and feeds in Japan. The trend over this period can be summarized as follows: 1) Total nitrogen discharge to the environment (total annual consumption) recorded the peak at 1,706 Gg in 1992, and it slightly decreased in 1997. On the supply side, domestic production of nitrogen has been decreasing since 1987, and the shortage is supplied from continuously increasing import. 2) As regards the increase of import in the “Livestock industry”, the relative importance of feed imports decreased, while that of imports in the form of products such as dressed carcasses and unprocessed milk increased. In addition, trends of the increasing dependence on foods from overseas are recognized in every phenomenon, such as an increase in import ratio in the supply to the “Food processing” and a decrease in “Crop residues” in domestic production. We examined the accuracy of the estimation of discharge from “Human food consumption” and “Livestock industry”, which accounted for approximately 86% of total discharge to the environment in 1997 by evaluating the goodness of fit to the relevant organic waste data. Out of the nitrogen discharge from “Human food consumption” (643 Gg), 601 Gg was considered to be discharged from domestic wastewater. The difference between this figure and a value of 543 Gg estimated using the nitrogen basic unit in sewage was about 10%. In addition, the nitrogen discharge from livestock excreta was estimated at approximately 731 Gg out of that from “Livestock industry” to the environment. This figure was equal to a value of 721 Gg estimated using the nitrogen basic unit in excreta of domestic raising livestock in 1999. Key words: accuracy of estimation, discharge to the environment, food and feed system in Japan, nitrogen flow Surface chemical composition of soil aggregates as a controlling factor of water repellency of forest soils Masahiro KOBAYASHI and Hiroaki MATSUI, For. For. Prod. Res. Inst. (Jpn. J. Soil Sci. Plant Nutr., 77, 525–531, 2006) Nondestructive surface chemical analysis using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was conducted to clarify the effect of outer-surface chemical composition of soil aggregates on the water repellency of forest soils. The ratios of carbon to oxygen (C/O) and nitrogen to oxygen (N/O) were higher on the outer surface than in the interior of soil aggregates, indicating that soil organic matter tends to accumulate on the outer surface of aggregates. The surface C/O ratio determined by XPS was not necessarily proportional to the total carbon content (TC) measured by the thermal combustion method. TC did not sufficiently explain the degree of soil water repellency expressed by the ethanol percentage (EP) (R2 = 0.34), whereas the surface C/O ratio by XPS sufficiently explained water repellency (R2= 0.74). The shapes of C1s spectra differed between strongly water-repellent soils under Japanese cypress and weakly water-repellent soils under deciduous broad-leaved trees. Soils with strong water repellency had C1s spectra rich in components of small chemical shift (small binding energy). These components correspond to carbon of nonpolar functional groups (C-C or C = C), i.e., not bound to atoms with high electronegativity, such as oxygen or nitrogen. The ratio of carbon with a small chemical shift to oxygen on the outer surface of soil aggregates could be regarded as a strong controlling factor of soil water repellency (R2= 0.86). Key words: forest soil, soil aggregate, surface chemical composition, water repellency, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy Adsorption characteristics of ammonium and phosphate in food industrial wastewater onto aluminosilicate Satoshi ASAOKA, Megumi KAWAI and Motomu AONO, Lab. Environ. Anal. Chem., Dept. Environ. Biosci., Fac. Agric., Meijo Univ. (Jpn. J. Soil Sci. Plant Nutr., 77, 533–539, 2006) Eutrophication has been a serious environmental problem all over the world. Nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus discharged into enclosed water bodies are major factors in eutrophication. The purpose of this study is to characterize the removal of ammonium and phosphate from food industrial wastewater with aluminosilicate. In batch experiments, adsorption kinetics of NH+ 4-N were described by the pseudo second order kinetic model. The adsorption isotherm for NH+ 4-N fit the Langmuir plots with 8.21 mg-N g−1 adsorption maximum and Henry plots was suitable for PO4 adsorption. The NH+ 4-N adsorption onto aluminosilicate was ion exchange reaction between Na+ and NH+ 4. The removal percentage of NH+ 4-N from 50 mL of 5 mg-N L−1 standard solution was greater than 85% at the initial pH 4–10. The NH+ 4-N removal decreased in the presence of the competitive ions and interference with competitive ions followed in the order of Ca2+ > Mg2+ > K+ > Na+. The removal percentage of PO4 from 50 mL of 5 mg-PO4 L−1 standard solution was highest at pH 3.7 and low values at pH < 1.5 and 5.6 < . However, the removal percentage of PO4 from 50 mL of 5 mg-PO4 L−1 mixed solution contained Ca2+, Mg2+, NH+ 4 was 28.4% and the PO4 in food industrial wastewater was removed well even if the pH value was 5.9–8.0, which removal mechanism still remains to be solved. The removal percentages of NH+ 4-N and PO4 from food industrial wastewater were 20.6–74.3% and 73.5–80.0%, respectively. Key words: adsorption, aluminosilicate, ammonium, food industrial wastewater, phosphate Effects of clinker ash on the properties of Jagaru soil, and growth and mineral composition of lettuce Hideo KUBOTERA, Natl. Agric. Res. Cent. for Kyushu Okinawa Region (Jpn. J. Soil Sci. Plant Nutr., 77, 541–548, 2006) A gray Terrestrial Regosol called “Jagaru” that corresponds to Udorthent in the Soil Taxonomy is widely distributed in the southwestern islands of Japan. Jagaru is a heavy-textured smectitic soil and shows problematic physical properties such as severe hardening by air-drying. In order to improve the physical properties, the effects of clinker ash, which is the coarse fraction of coal ash, on the properties of Jagaru, and growth and mineral composition of lettuce were investigated. Physical and chemical analysis of clinker ash revealed that it is a mixture of grains of various particle sizes and chemical composition. Total elemental composition of bulk clinker ash was similar to Jagaru. Application of clinker ash increased available water content and reduced solid ratio, bulk density and the strength of air-dried soil blocks of Jagaru, and clinker ash was more effective for the improvement of these physical soil properties than river sand of the same quantity. On the other hand, pot cultivation experiments showed that the application of clinker ash does not increase the yield of lettuce, and heavy application of the ash caused a slight reduction of yield. The yield was remarkably small in the plot that was not watered before planting in order to reduce the salinity caused by ash. According to the effect of clinker ash for improvement of the physical properties of soil greater than usual sand and the inverse effect for lettuce growth and cost for the transportation of ash, a suitable amount of application was assumed to be around 10% of topsoil which corresponds to 240 t ha−1. No problematic effect such as heavy metal accumulation in the plant was caused by ash application. Key words: clinker ash, heavy soil, Jagaru, physical properties improvement Possible uptake of protein-like organic nitrogen in a soil by some vegetables and tea plants Nobuyuki MIURA*, Noriharu AE**, Koji UCHIMURA* and Shingo MATSUMOTO*** *Kagoshima Tea Exp. Sta., New name:Tea Div., Kagoshima Prefect. Inst. Agric. Develop., **Nat. Inst. Agro-Environ. Sci., Present address:Fac. Agric., Kobe Univ., ***Fac. Life Environ. Sci., Shimane Univ. (Jpn. J. Soil Sci. Plant Nutr., 77, 549–554, 2006) In order to examine a possible uptake of protein-like organic nitrogen in a soil by tea plants (Camellia sinensis L.) and 6 vegetables species (cucumber (Cucumis sativus L.), chingensai (Brassica campestris L.), leaf lettuce (Lactuca sativa L.), broccoli (Brassica oleracea L. var. italica), spinach (Spinacia oleracea L.) and maize (Zea mays L.)), HPSEC analysis of the xylem saps collected from these 7 plants was conducted. One series of these 7 plant species were grown on a pot filled with soil supplemented with organic matter, while another series of 7 plant species were grown on solution culture or vermiculite-filled pot with chemical fertilizer only. Our findings were as follows: The concentration of mineral nitrogen found in the xylem saps collected from the 6 vegetables in plots with chemical fertilizer were higher than in plots with organic matter. This result showed that the uptake of mineral nitrogen in a soil of these 6 vegetables in plots with chemical fertilizer were higher than in plots with organic matter. Substances with the same molecular weight as protein-like organic nitrogen (estimated molecular weight 4,000–5,000 Da) extracted with water and potassium chloride in soils were detected from the xylem saps of the 6 vegetables and the tea plants by HPSEC analysis. Interestingly, the HPSEC peak height of same substances of protein-like organic nitrogen from the xylem saps of 6 vegetables and the tea plant (cv. Saemidori) were higher in plots with organic matter than in plots with chemical fertilizer. Moreover, the same HPSEC peak of substances of protein-like organic nitrogen in the xylem saps collected from the tea plants (cv. Yabukita and Yutakamidori) in the general manuring practice, which were cultivated in the tea plantation managed at Chiran region in Kagoshima Japan, were also detected. These results indicated that there was a possibility of a direct uptake of protein-like organic nitrogen in a soil not only by vegetables but also by tea plants in addition to mineral nitrogen in a soil. Key words: HPSEC, protein-like organic nitrogen, tea plant, vegetable, xylem sap Optimization of nutrient supply in drip-application (Fertigation) Culture. 1. Phosphorus application adjusted with the soil phosphorus status Yasuhito HAYASHI, Masahiko KATOH, Arata KOBAYASHI and Shozo KUBO, JA ZEN-NOH R&D Cent. (Jpn. J. Soil Sci. Plant Nutr., 77, 555–561, 2006) In the drip-application (fertigation) culture, plant nutrients are supplied both from nutrient solution and from soil media. In this study, the effect of phosphorus contents in the soil or in the nutrient solution on the growth of melon (Cucumis melo) and tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum) was examined. The soil used in this study was allophanic andosol which had high phosphorus fixation capacity. 1) When the Truog-P content was approximately 200 mg P2O5 kg−1 or more in the soil, the yield of melon (one fruit per plant) and tomato (in the fifth cluster stage culture) was almost the same regardless of the phosphorus contents in the nutrient solution. 2) When the Truog-P content was approximately 1,000 mg P2O5 kg−1 or more in the soil, the absorption of phosphorus in melon and tomato was almost the same regardless of the phosphorus contents in the nutrient solution. 3) In the soil highly enriched with the phosphorus as frequently observed in farmers"" greenhouse soils, there is no need to supply any further phosphorus in the nutrient solution because its recovery is very low. Curtailment of phosphorus is certainly helps to make the soil phosphorus status more appropriate and to reduce the fertilizer cost for the farmers. 4) As to the nutritional diagnostic criteria for the phosphorus concentration, we propose 150 mg P L−1 in the sap of melon petioles collected at the thinning in the spring-summer season, and 200 mg P L−1 in the sap of tomato petioles just under the first cluster fruits of 2–3 cm diameter in the fifth cluster stage culture in autumn-winter season. 5) Phosphorus concentration of the petiole sap reflected the phosphorus nutritional status very well. Therefore, by adjusting the nutrient composition of the solution with the soil testing before planting and with petiole sap diagnosis during the plant growth periods, we can achieve the optimized fertilization in the drip-application culture. Key words: drip-application, fertigation, melon, phosphorus, tomato Relationship between soil iodine and “Akagare” disease of rice plant Hidekazu YAMADA, Yuji ONAGAWA, Takeo ADACHI*, Katsuyuki TAKAHASHI* and Koyo YONEBAYASHI** Kyoto Prefect. Univ., *Kyoto Prefect. Agric. Res. Inst., **Ishikawa Prefect. Univ. (Jpn. J. Soil Sci. Plant Nutr., 77, 563–568, 2006) Rice plants accumulate iodine and display a physiological disorder due to the toxicity of iodine. The disorder is called “Akagare” disease. The relationship between soluble iodine in soil and “Akagare” disease of rice plants was examined. Seedlings of rice plants 20 d after germination were grown in soils rich in iodine for 29 d. In addition, the difference in response to “Akagare” disease among varieties of rice plants was compared. 1. Soluble iodine was evaluated by incubating a mixture of 2 g of soil and 10 mL of 2.8 × 10−2 mol L−1 glucose solution for 10 to 20 d at 30. The concentration of iodine absorbed by rice plants correlated positively with the concentration of soluble iodine in soil. 2. Height and dry weight of shoots of rice plants decreased with the increase in the concentration of iodine in rice plants due to the toxicity of iodine. 3. The symptom of “Akagare” disease became remarkable when the concentration of iodine in rice plants (shoots) was over 300 mg kg−1 (dry weight basis). Iodine concentration in rice plants exceeded 300 mg kg−1 when the concentration of soluble iodine in soil surpassed 6–8 mg kg−1. From these results, it was indicated that the possibility of incidence of “Akagare” disease was predicted on the basis of the concentration of soluble iodine in soil. 4. A remarkable difference in response to “Akagare” disease among varieties of rice plants was recognized. Key words: “Akagare” disease, iodine, soil iodine, soluble iodine Effects of the kind and amount of SO2− 4 and Cl− in organic and inorganic fertilizers on nitrate concentration in leaf vegetables Masahiko KATOH, Yasuhito HAYASHI and Hiromasa MORIKUNI, JA ZEN-NOH R&D Cent. (Jpn. J. Soil Sci. Plant Nutr., 77, 569–575, 2006) We examined effects of SO2− 4 and Cl− concentration in fertilizers on NO− 3 concentrations in spinach (Spinacea oleracea L.) and ching guang juai (Brassica chinensis L.) in the isolation floor cultivation. By combining ammonium sulfate, ammonium chloride, urea or rapeseed meal as N fertilizer and potassium sulfate or potassium chloride as K fertilizer, various treatments were prepared in this experiment. Multi-phosphate was uniformly applied as P fertilizer. They were applied as basal fertilizers at the rates of 15 g of N per m2, 6.5 g of P per m2, and 12.5 g of K per m2. The main results obtained were as follows. 1) There were no differences in yield and nitrogen uptake of spinach and ching guang juai among the treatments. Nitrate concentration in plants decreased with the increase in the amount of Cl− applied to the soil with highly negative correlation. In contrast, there was no relationship between NO− 3 concentration in plants and the amount of SO2− 4 applied to the soil. These findings indicate that application of chlorides to the soil lowers NO− 3 concentration in leaf vegetables without any effect on their growth. 2) As there was no significant difference in NO− 3 concentration in plants between ammonium sulfate and rapeseed meal applications, the effect of the form of fertilizers, inorganic or organic, was concluded to be minor to that of anions in fertilizer, SO2− 4 or Cl−, on NO− 3 concentration in leaf vegetables.
