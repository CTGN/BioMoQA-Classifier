However, metrics of phylogenetic diversity ( PD ) reflect a community's evolutionary potential and reveal the potential for additional conservation value above that based purely on SR . Although PD is typically correlated with SR , localized differences in this relationship have been found in different taxa. Here, we explore geographical variation in global avian PD . We identify where PD is higher or lower than expected (from SR ) and explore correlates of those differences, to find communities with high irreplaceability, in terms of the uniqueness of evolutionary histories. Location Global terrestrial. Methods Using comprehensive avian phylogenies and global distributional data for all extant birds, we calculated SR and Faith's PD , a widely applied measure of community PD , across the terrestrial world. We modelled the relationship between avian PD for terrestrial birds and its potential environmental correlates. Analyses were conducted at a global scale and also for individual biogeographical realms. Potential explanatory variables of PD included SR , long‐term climate stability, climatic diversity (using altitudinal range as a proxy), habitat diversity and proximity to neighbouring realms. Results We identified areas of high and low relative PD ( rPD ; PD relative to that expected given SR ). Areas of high rPD were associated with deserts and islands, while areas of low rPD were associated with historical glaciation. Our results suggest that rPD is correlated with different environmental variables in different parts of the world. Main conclusions There is geographical variation in avian rPD , much of which can be explained by putative drivers. However, the importance of these drivers shows pronounced regional variation. Moreover, the variation in avian rPD differs substantially from patterns found for mammals and amphibians. We suggest that PD adds additional insights about the irreplaceability of communities to conventional metrics of biodiversity based on SR , and could be usefully included in assessments of site valuation and prioritization.",1,0,0.038548097,openalex

In particular, they treat dispersal as a secondary process rather than an equal to vicariance and cite Brown & Lomolino (1998) and myself (Wilkinson, 2001a) as examples from the current literature that they believe overemphasize the importance of dispersal. They suggest that dispersal biogeographers have ignored the importance of Earth processes such as plate tectonics and they suggest that biogeography suffers from ‘a plethora of methods’ and as such is ‘not seen as a field in its own right’ (Ebach & Humphries, 2003, p. 959). Before addressing their main points, this more general comment about ‘a plethora of methods’ deserves some consideration. Ebach and Humphries appear to believe that there should be a tight definition of biogeography, which clearly differentiates the subject from related disciplines (something they see as currently lacking). From this definition should follow a correct method for approaching these carefully defined biogeographical problems, a method which they see as grounded in cladistics and vicariance. While this is a caricature of their views, resulting from my attempts to describe their main arguments with brevity, like most good caricatures I believe it preserves the key features. Biogeography, however, is just one part of our attempt to understand the Universe, and the classification of this attempt at understanding into multiple disciplines (biogeography, ecology, geology, cosmology, chemistry, etc.) is an artificial one designed for our convenience. Indeed the philosopher Midgley (1989, 2001) has strongly argued that we have impeded our understanding of the world by overemphasizing these unnatural divisions. Biogeography does not need a rigorous definition beyond a general statement that it is about the distribution of organisms in space and time. Indeed such a definition could be harmful by potentially excluding much that is relevant as outside the scope of the subject. It seems to me that complex subjects are likely to yield best to ‘a plethora of methods’ with different methods being more or less suitable to different questions within the general field of enquiry. So a cladistic approach may be useful for some, but by no means all, biogeographical questions. The above argument is nicely illustrated by Ebach and Humphries’ central point that the dynamic view of the Earth, produced by our understanding of plate tectonics, is central to biogeography and dispersal-centred explanations are largely an outdated survivor from a static view of the Earth's continents. This view fails to appreciate that the relative importance of dispersal and vicariance (driven by plate tectonics) differs depending on the biogeographical question under investigation. For example, if I am interested in the biogeography of the tiger Panthera tigris, and if we assume that this species had a point of origin in space–time in the recent geological past, then dispersal will be one of the key relevant mechanisms in understanding its current distribution, with plate tectonics of little importance. However, if I am interested in the distribution of the order Carnivora then plate tectonics becomes more important. The larger the geological time-scale of interest and the higher the taxonomic unit being studied, the more likely it is that vicariance is important. However, most of the studies published by this Journal have time-scales of the Quaternary, or less, and focus on the species level. Here dispersal and extinction are usually more important than vicariance and as such cladistic methods are less useful. At the Quaternary time-scale the most dramatic dynamic aspect of the Earth have been the glacial/interglacial cycles. Fossil evidence suggests that dispersal (along with extinction) has been a key mechanism by which species respond to these changes (Huntley & Webb, 1989; Bennett, 1997). The comments about scale, both taxonomic and temporal, made above apply to the large organisms that dominate most biogeography textbooks (e.g. Brown & Lomolino, 1998; Cox & Moore, 2000) and most papers in this Journal. However, much of the Earth's biodiversity is microbial (Margulis & Schwartz, 1998) and these microbes are crucial to most ecological processes (Wilkinson, 1998; Newman & Banfield, 2002). For these organisms it seems likely that the ease of their dispersal swamps vicariance in importance. It has long been a maxim in microbiology that ‘everything is everywhere, the environment selects’. The idea being that free living microbes are so small and numerous that they can disperse everywhere and unlike larger organisms are only absent from sites because of unsuitable habitats. There is now much evidence in support of this idea (Finlay, 2002), although the largest microbes may be an exception to this general rule (Wilkinson, 2001b). While this view of cosmopolitan microbial biogeography is not universally accepted (e.g. Mann & Droop, 1996; Foissner, 1999) it seems unlikely that the vicariance-inspired cladistic approach will be useful for microbes. The importance of dispersal is illustrated most dramatically by isolated volcanic islands such as Ascension Island and St Helena in the south Atlantic, Christmas Island in the Indian Ocean and Guadalupe in the Pacific (Whittaker, 1998). Without dispersal all these islands would be devoid of terrestrial life! A theoretical base for biogeography that was inapplicable to such fascinating islands would be sadly lacking. In conclusion, for some groups, such as microbes, universal dispersal appears to rule out a significant role for vicariance. For other groups it depends on the question asked (especially the taxonomic and temporal scales). Even at scales that appear ideal for a vicariance-inspired explanation, dispersal can turn out to provide a better answer. For example, recent work on chameleons has concluded that ‘Oceanic dispersal – not Gondwanan break up – facilitated species radiation’ (Raxworthy et al., 2002). Darwin (1859) may have showed great good sense in emphasizing the importance of dispersal, not merely because he did not know about plate tectonics, but because dispersal is a fundamental process in understanding much of biogeography. I thank Jim Brown and Brett Riddle for useful discussions. David Wilkinson has wide interests in biology, environmental science and the history of science. His theoretical work has concentrated on biogeography, evolutionary ecology and the Earth system (Gaia). His more empirical studies have included work on Quaternary palaeoecology, environmental archaeology (especially around the English Lake District) and the ecology of protozoa.",1,0,0.0038297994,openalex

Recent studies found that specialist species were more affected by fragment size and isolation than generalists. However, the mechanisms underlying different effects of area and isolation among specialists and generalists are unknown. We tested the predictions of IBT on butterfly assemblages in Tokyo, Japan, and hypothesized that the effects of fragment size and isolation would be stronger for specialists than for generalists. We classified butterfly species into specialists and generalists for each of two dimensions (food range and voltinism) and according to tolerance to the matrix. We recorded 26 feeding specialists and 27 generalists, 24 seasonal specialists and 29 generalists, 32 low matrix-tolerant species and 21 high matrix-tolerant species in 20 forest fragments. We used generalized linear models to relate the number of species in a fragment to fragment size and isolation (distance to the mainland). The averaged models based on AICc showed that fragment size had positive and significant effects on both specialist and generalist and high matrix-tolerant butterfly species richness. However, the negative effects of isolation on species richness were only found in specialist and low matrix-tolerant species. Our results demonstrate that patch isolation only affects specialist species. This suggests that when applying IBT to terrestrial fragmented landscapes, researchers should be careful not to overlook patch area and isolation effects on specialists.",1,0,0.0039207563,openalex

We demonstrated the use of a stable isotope mixing model for measuring the ecological niches of consumers. In particular, we used the model IsotopeR to estimate the resource use of two species with complex, omnivorous diets: invasive Norway rats from the Aleutian Islands, AK , and American black bears from Yosemite National Park, CA . Marginal posterior distributions for major food sources (for populations, groups and individuals) described the resource axes that partly define the realized niches of these omnivores. We used measures of these resource axes to inform resource management in the Aleutians and Yosemite. Results from our analyses confirm that coastal rats did not rely on marine birds on rat‐infested islands in the Aleutians. Instead, rats foraged primarily on terrestrial plants and preferred amphipods when they were available. We also use stable isotopes to confirm that plants and acorns are the largest contributors to black bear nutrition in Yosemite and learned that female bears foraged for acorns and pine nuts more heavily than males. Although it is unclear if Norway rats can maintain viable populations in the Aleutians without access to marine‐derived animal protein, results from our analyses suggest their dependence on such nutrients. In addition, sex‐specific differences in foraging for high‐fat acorns and pine nuts in Yosemite suggest black bear populations in the Sierra Nevada may be limited by the productivity and health of hard mast species. As demonstrated here, stable isotope analysis has wide applicability for investigating the resource use and ecological niches of animals. We anticipate and encourage its rapid development in this fundamental field of ecology.",1,0,0.0057439413,openalex

Adults in two exposed breeding ponds preferred deep, vegetated areas. In a heavily shaded pond, the males segregated from the females and preferred nonvegetated areas, and in a pond with bluegills, the adults preferred shallow zones. On land, most resident salamanders remained close to a breeding pond that was immediately surrounded by a steep bank and woods, whereas few stayed close to exposed ponds with little ground cover. Salamanders were facultative emigrators, making major emigratory movements during spring, fall, or both, or not migrating at all. Two displaced salamanders showed normal pond activity but atypical terrestrial movements. Frequent predation occurred in small-mammal runways, most likely by short-tailed shrews. Salamanders excavated tunnels for temporary refuge but used small-mammal runway systems for long-term refuge.

For proper nematode management, it is essential to know the spatial distribution of economically important plant-parasitic nematodes and free-living nematodes that play important roles in terrestrial ecosystems. We aimed to reveal nematode fauna and soil properties in 85 sugarcane fields of three major sugarcane producing islands in Japan, and to examine their relationship by using the mixed-effect model and by visualizing the spatial distributions using the inverse distance weighting (IDW) approach. The nematode community structures were analyzed by non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS). Among plant-parasitic nematodes in sugarcane, the root-lesion nematodes (Pratylenchus sp.) and the stunt nematodes (Tylenchorhynchus sp.) were widely distributed in these islands, yet the abundance and the species varied geospatially. Soil pH was significantly correlated with the abundance of Pratylenchus and Tylenchorhynchus species. The abundance of Pratylenchus and Tylenchorhynchus species were significantly correlated with soil pH. The abundance of Pratylenchus was significantly correlated with the abundance of free-living nematodes, the number of free-living nematode species, and exchangeable cation K+, as were the abundance of Tylenchorhynchus to the clay content and that of non-Tylenchorhynchus.

The small land areas and low elevation render the terrestrial communities susceptible to local extinctions from overwash and inundation due to tropical cyclones. Such recurring catastrophic disturbances should be expected to drive strong priority effects and historical contingency in species assembly, thus also promoting species turnover within atolls. This stands contradictory to the received wisdom of atolls consisting of numerous uniform, replicated island systems. We tested the hypothesis that the individual islets within an atoll exhibit compositional turnover and that this species turnover within atolls is related to cyclone frequency. Location: Atolls worldwide. Time Period: Present. Taxa Studied: Vascular plants, reptiles, birds. Methods: We compiled a global dataset at the level of islets for species presence/absence within atolls. We obtained long-term (80 year) tropical cyclone frequency data for each atoll from the NOAA hurricane database and used Bayesian regression to estimate the effects of tropical cyclone frequency on species turnover within atolls. Results: We consistently measured high within-atoll species turnover (i.e., between the individual islets within an atoll) on atolls worldwide. The degree of within-atoll species turnover increases with increasing tropical cyclone frequency. Atolls that are more frequently hit by tropical cyclones show higher species turnover between their islets than those that occur outside the tropical cyclone belt. Main Conclusions: Tropical cyclones are a significant driver of the community assemblages on atolls. These catastrophic disturbances promote a heterogenous atoll landscape, which challenges perceptions that the islets within an atoll are identical replicates of the entire atoll terrestrial community. Biodiversity surveys undertaken at the islet-level (alpha-diversity) might therefore not be representative of the entire atoll metacommunity (gamma) diversity. © 2023 The Authors.

However, the generality of this phenomenon has not been tested with similarly complete data from other taxonomic groups. In this study we describe three statistical patterns of body size in snakes, all of which indicate an optimal length of 1.0 m. First, a distribution of largest body lengths of 618 snake species had a single mode at 1.0 m. Second, we found a positive relationship between the size of the largest member of an island snake assemblage and island area and a negative relationship between the size of the smallest member of an island snake assemblage and island area. Best-fit lines through these data cross at a point corresponding to 1.0 m in body length, the presumed optimal size for a one-species island. Third, mainland snake species smaller than 1.0 m become larger on islands whereas those larger than 1.0 m become smaller on islands. The observation that all three analyses converge on a common body size is concordant with patterns observed in mammals and partial analyses of four other disparate animal clades. Because snakes differ so strikingly from mammals (ectotherms, gape-limited predators, elongate body shape) the concordant patterns of these two groups provide strong evidence for the evolution of an optimal body size within independent monophyletic groups. However, snakes differ from other taxonomic groups that have been studied in exhibiting a body size distribution that is not obviously skewed in either direction. We suggest that idiosyncratic features of the natural history of ectotherms allow relatively unconstrained distributions of body size whereas physiological limitations of endotherms constrain distributions of body size to a right skew.",1,0,0.02657111,openalex

Penguin numbers along the southern and central coast of Peru (97% of the total) did not differ significantly between 1999 and 2000; the average number was 4,425 individuals. In 1999, the proportion of juveniles (one-year-old birds) was only 0.2% compared with 7% in 2000, probably as a result of the 1997-98 El Niño. Penguins were found from La Foca Island (512’S) to Punta Coles (1742’S). However, the majority (78%) were clustered in five localities, Punta San Juan (36%), San Juanito Islet (11%), Hornillos Island (10%), Pachacamac Island (12%) and Tres Puertas (9%). The size and distribution of penguin colonies have changed over the last 15 years. Penguins have abandoned sites at Punta Corio, Sombrerillo and Morro Sama, and have decreased significantly in numbers in Punta San Fernando and Punta La Chira, where human disturbance has increased, mainly due to local fisheries activities. Penguins have increased at Punta San Juan, San Juanito Islet and San Gallan Island, all of which are partially protected. Half of the penguins were located in guano bird reserves, primarily at Punta San Juan. Guano bird reserves provide some protection against terrestrial predators and human disturbance; however, periodical guano extraction decreases their breeding success. Most penguin sites were found in inaccessible and marginal areas, which were vulnerable to occasional and unpredictable flooding from ocean swells. The methodology recommended by the Population and Habitat Viability Assessment workshop for a consistent census of penguins in Peru and Chile during the molting period was validated at the Punta San Juan Reserve.

Decision-support tools, such as life cycle assessment (LCA), are widely used for developing strategies to achieve such objectives. Currently available life cycle impact assessment (LCIA) methods apply the countryside species-area relationship (c-SAR) to quantify habitat conversion impacts on species richness. However, additional effects of habitat fragmentation are yet ignored in these assessments. We use the species-habitat relationship (SHR), an adaptation of the c-SAR that considers both habitat conversion and fragmentation effects, to develop a new set of land-use characterisation factors for 702 terrestrial ecoregions (in 238 countries), four land-use types (urban, cropland, pasture, and forestry), and four taxonomic groups (amphibians, birds, mammals, and reptiles; plus the aggregate of these vertebrate groups). The SHR generally predicts higher per-area impacts of land-use than the impacts estimated by the c-SAR (a median relative difference of +9%), indicating that land-use impacts may be systematically underestimated when ignoring fragmentation effects. Whereas per-area impacts of land-use on regional species richness are highest in temperate regions, reflecting the diminished extent of natural habitat, per-area impacts of land-use on global species richness are highest in the subtropics, reflecting the importance of tropical regions and islands to global vertebrate species diversity. The large variety in magnitude of land-use impacts across the world's regions emphasizes the importance of regionalised assessments.

Wildlife responses to urbanization, however, are greatly variable and, paradoxically, some threatened species may achieve much larger populations in urban than in natural habitats. Urban conservation hotspots may therefore help some species avoid regional or even global extinctions, but not conserve their often overlooked ecological functions in the wild. We aim to draw attention to this issue using two species of globally threatened parrots occurring in the Dominican Republic: the Hispaniolan amazon (Amazona ventralis) and the Hispaniolan parakeet (Psittacara chloropterus). Methods: We conducted a large-scale roadside survey in June 2017 across the country to estimate the relative abundance of parrots in natural habitats, rural habitats, and cities. We combined this with informal interviews with local people to collect information on past and current human impacts on parrot populations. We also looked for foraging parrots to assess their potential role as seed dispersers, an ecological function that has been overlooked until very recently. Results: Relative abundances of both parrot species were negligible in rural areas and very low in natural habitats. They were generally between one and two orders of magnitude lower than that of congeneric species inhabiting other Neotropical ecosystems. Relative abundances were six times higher in cities than in natural habitats in the case of the Hispaniolan parakeet and three times higher in the case of the Hispaniolan amazon. People indicated hunting for a source food and to mitigate crop damage as causes of parrot population declines, and a vigorous illegal trade for parrots (131 individuals recorded, 75% of them poached very recently), mostly obtained from protected areas where the last small wild populations remain. We observed parrots foraging on 19 plant species from 11 families, dispersing the fruits of 14 species by carrying them in their beaks and consuming them in distant perching trees. They discarded undamaged mature seeds, with the potential to germinate, in 99.5% of cases (n = 306), and minimum dispersal distances ranged from 8 to 155 m (median = 37 m). Discussion: The loss of ecological functions provided by some species when they disappear from natural habitats and only persist in cities may have long-term, unexpected effects on ecosystems. Our example demonstrates how two cities may soon be the last refuges for two endemic parrots if overharvesting continues, in which case their overlooked role as seed dispersers would be completely lost in nature. The functional extinction of these species could strongly affect vegetation communities in an island environment where seed-dispersal species are naturally scarce. While conservation plans must include urban populations of threatened species, greater efforts are needed to restore their populations in natural habitats to conserve ecological functions. © 2018 Luna et al.",1,0,0.099719,positives

 The Mediterranean Basin (MB) is a species-rich biogeographical region with many endemic taxa. We analysed the historical patterns of temporal and geographical diversification of Mediterranean Blaps (Tenebrionidae), a diverse group of flightless beetles, estimated their date of origin and colonization of the MB, and tracked temporal changes in diversification rates.
 
 Location
 Mediterranean Basin.
 
 Methods
 We reconstructed the phylogenetic relationships of Mediterranean Blaps using four mitochondrial genes and 47 morphological characters. Divergence-time estimates were investigated with a Bayesian relaxed clock approach that was calibrated with both fossil and geological constraints. Biogeographical analyses were performed using the dispersal–extinction–cladogenesis likelihood model associated with a stratified palaeogeographical scenario. Diversification rate analyses allowed the investigation of diversity dynamics through time as well as rate shifts during major Cenozoic climate events.
 
 Results
 The Bayesian relaxed clock analysis suggests that Blaps first appeared in the MB about 28 Ma. The most likely scenario is that Mediterranean Blaps originated in the Arabian and north-east African regions and then dispersed progressively westwards and northwards, using temporary land bridges to colonize the northern shores of the MB. Island endemics are more likely to be the products of recent dispersals than of old vicariance events. Birth–death analyses suggest that diversification rates in the Miocene and Pliocene are consistent with a ‘museum model’, in which most of the extant diversity is best explained by a steady accumulation of lineages under constant diversification rates. Although major Cenozoic climatic events do not seem to have influenced the diversification of Mediterranean Blaps, a decrease in diversification rates was detected during the Pleistocene.
 
 Main conclusions
 Our results suggest that Mediterranean Blaps lineages diversified between the Oligocene and the Pliocene, with current distribution patterns mostly accounted for by early vicariance and late dispersal events. Diversification rates were relatively constant through time, but decreased during Pleistocene glaciation cycles. This scenario may be applicable to other Mediterranean terrestrial animal taxa.",1,0,0.0059757056,openalex

The Hellshire Hills constitute a dry limestone forest reserve on the south coast of Jamaica that is of high conservation value. In order to describe the structure and composition of this forest and assess the extent to which the population structures of its tree species do characterize their regeneration ecologies, pre-disturbance structure, floristics and seedling populations were compared with post-disturbance species responses in twelve 15 m x 15 m permanent sample plots which were laid out in a blocked design in April 1998, giving a total sample area of 0.27 ha. These plots were subjected to disturbance in April 1999 (cutting) with each of four blocks being assigned with two randomly allocated treatment plots (partially and clear cut) and one control plot (uncut). A total of 1278 trees (≥2 cm DBH) and 7863 seedlings and saplings (0-2 mm and 2-20 mm root collar diameter (RCD) respectively), comprising 60 and 52 species, respectively, were sampled in the plots prior to disturbance. The species-area curve for trees reached a maximum at 0.20 ha, and abundance was widely distributed amongst the species (26 had importance values greater than 1%); four species were notably codominant (with importance values between 7 and 8%). The forest stand structure had a reverse J-shaped curve for tree and for seedling/sapling size-class distributions, which indicated that the forest as a whole was probably regenerating adequately. From an analysis based on adult and sapling size-class distributions (SCDs), 21 species with 15 or more individuals were classified into 3 groups. Many of the species (15 of the 21), had flat adult SCDs that deviate from the whole-community reverse J-shaped SCD. However, sapling SCDs for 6 of the 15 species were strongly positive indicating the potential for their populations to be sustained by recruitment from the saplings present. No general association was found between these SCD species groupings and the actual ability of the species to recover from disturbance. Analysis of post-disturbance response revealed that for only 9 of the 21 species did adult SCDs provide adequate prediction, but for an additional 6 of the species information on sapling SCDs improved the accuracy of prediction if the 'release' of saplings or smaller individuals predominated recovery. However in this forest, recovery following disturbance which left stem and roots in place is predominantly by coppice regrowth, and there were no significant correlations found between adult SCDs and the species' ability to coppice. © Springer 2005.",1,0,0.00971275,positives

It is often addressed as a “miracle tree” for offering a wide variety of ecosystem services and possessing strong ecological attributes. The multiple uses of leucaena in agroforestry, livestock, and restoration practices led to the worldwide distribution of its ssp. glabrata and leucocephala . However, following its introduction into non-native regions, the commercial value of ssp. leucocephala was challenged by its large-scale spread outside the cultivation zone. It has assumed a status of an environmental weed and invasive plant in many regions across Africa (17 countries and Island nations), Asia (17), Europe (1), Oceania (23), North America (12), and South America (7). The plant is enlisted in the top five terrestrial invasive plant species with the greatest international presence. The species is now considered one of the 100 worst invaders in the world. The plant mainly invades roadsides, wastelands, cultivated lands, riverbanks, and forest edges, and suppresses the growth of other woody and herbaceous species. Its infestations alter the patterns of vegetation, plant succession, and community assembly in the introduced habitats. Propagation of ssp. leucocephala , without considering the environmental risks associated with it, may result in major repercussions and irreparable losses. Therefore, it is important to discuss its invasive propensities and the possible alternatives that may replace the weedy species without encumbering its economic benefits. This review aims to thoroughly evaluate the ecological and invasive attributes of leucaena, promote awareness about the ecological costs associated with its spread, and suggest suitable options for its management.",1,0,0.0040542376,openalex

In this context, Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC), home to 60% of the global biodiversity, play an important role in the development of an integrative biodiversity monitoring platform. In this review, we explore to what extent LAC has advanced in the adoption of remote sensing for biodiversity monitoring and what are the gaps and opportunities to integrate local monitoring into global efforts to halt biodiversity loss. Location: Latin America and the Caribbean. Time period: 1995 to 2022. Taxa studied: Terrestrial organisms. Methods: We reviewed the application of remote sensing for biodiversity monitoring in LAC aiming to identify gaps and opportunities across countries, ecosystem types and research networks. Results: Our analysis illustrates how the use of remote sensing in LAC is disproportionately low in relation to the biodiversity it supports. Main conclusions: Build upon this analysis, we present, discuss and offer perspectives regarding four gaps identified in the application of remote sensing for biodiversity monitoring in Latin America and the Caribbean, namely (1) alignment between remote sensing data resolution and ecosystem structure; (2) investment in research, institutions and capacity building within researchers and stakeholders; (3) decolonized practices that promote access to publishing outlets and pluralistic participation among countries that facilitate exchange of experiences and capacity building; and (4) development of networks within and across regions to advance in ground surveys, ensure access and to foster the use of remote sensing data. © 2024 The Authors.

The aim of this study was to infer diversification processes and mechanisms of Cenozoic diversity dynamics using woody angiosperms. Location East Asian continental islands and global. Time period Cenozoic. Major taxa studied Woody plants. Methods We compiled Cenozoic fossil and modern records for woody angiosperm genera to reconstruct biodiversity patterns. To evaluate the relative importance of TNC and OTT, we investigated extinction/survival patterns and latitudinal range dynamics for each genus, in combination with their clade age (mean family age), cold tolerance and per‐genus species richness. Results We found diversity decreasing with latitude in modern‐day flora, but not in the warmer periods of the Neogene and Palaeogene. The percentage of genera surviving decreased with latitude through the Cenozoic. Older genera with less cold tolerance and/or species‐poor genera went extinct locally at high latitudes in response to post‐Pliocene global cooling. Evolutionarily younger temperate genera dispersed from the extratropics to lower latitudes and the Southern Hemisphere after the Neogene. Main conclusions The latitudinal diversity gradient (LDG) has rapidly steepened post‐Pliocene through: (a) selective extinction in higher latitudes of old, less‐diversified tropical genera with low freezing tolerance, and (b) equatorward distributional shift of temperate genera. Both these processes were driven by the high‐latitude cooling. Such major roles of TNC and OTT, wherein temperate genera in the Northern Hemisphere expanded through the tropics into higher latitudes of the Southern Hemisphere across climatic boundaries without losing their temperate presence, are in contrast to OTT processes in marine systems. Cenozoic patterns of terrestrial woody angiosperm biodiversity indicate the importance of TNC and high‐latitude processes, including the extinction of tropical genera and range contraction or shift of temperate genera.",1,0,0.17820153,openalex

The richness in different areas, as well as the distributions of all 40 genera and 311 species were analysed, the patterns examined and possible mechanisms discussed. The published data of freshwater crab species and their distributions in East Asia were analysed by using clustering, diversity index and graphical methods. Six biogeographical districts were recognized for the East Asian freshwater crabs based on similarity of distribution: (I) Hengduanshan Area, including Yunnan and Tibet; (II) Karst Area of Guizhou; (III) Yangtze River Basin, extending to Yellow River basin, with three subdivisions; (IV) Wuyishan Area and Pearl River Basin in Southeast and South China; (V) Hainan Island; and (VI) East Asian Islands, with subdivisions of Taiwan, Ryukyus and mainland Japan. The most diverse genera are the potamids Sinopotamon (84 species) and Geothelphusa (54 species), as well as the gecarcinucid Somanniathelphusa (27 species). Yunnan has the highest species richness (48 species) and diversity (Shannon index 2.21) in continental China, while Taiwan has the highest species richness (42 species) of the island systems. The distribution of the species of the potamid Sinopotamon and other genera along China's longest drainage, the Yangtze River, can be subdivided into several zones corresponding to the upper, middle and lower reaches of the river basin. The freshwater crab fauna of continental China, the East Asian islands and Hainan Island were all different from each other, and this finding agreed with the findings of molecular phylogenetic studies. The distribution of freshwater crabs in the Yangtze River showed a similar pattern with other freshwater organisms in this drainage. The present biogeographical interpretation contrasts sharply with the traditional zoogeographical patterns proposed that are based on Chinese terrestrial vertebrates. The present analyses of crab distributions suggest that Yunnan is a possible centre of origin for the Potamidae of China and perhaps the whole of East Asia. The freshwater crab species richness in Yunnan is probably the result of its generally warmer climate, more diverse habitats and a long history of cladogenesis.",1,0,0.010440415,openalex

In the present study, we conducted a 7-month survey within a 5-km stretch in the urbanised Attanagalu-Oya river area to study habitat associations, mesohabitat use and behaviour of V. salvator in urban landscapes. The greatest number of monitor sightings was made in aquatic habitats, followed by terrestrial and arboreal habitats within the riparian zone. Sightings of different life history stages of V. salvator across major habitat types varied significantly. The adults and subadults associated mostly with aquatic and terrestrial habitats, whereas hatchlings and juveniles associated mostly with aquatic and arboreal habitats. Given variable sighting frequencies of distinct life history stages across different major habitat types, it is likely that there is substantial age-structured niche partitioning in V. salvator. The urban population of V. salvator studied seemed to be fairly abundant, and resilient to anthropogenic stressors and adversity of urbanisation.

Location Europe. Methods Numbers of naturalized alien species of plants, insects, herptiles, birds and mammals occurring in 10 habitats defined according to the European Nature Information System (EUNIS) were obtained from 115 regional data sets. Only species introduced after ad 1500 were considered. Data were analysed by ANCOVA and regression trees to assess whether differences exist among taxonomic groups in terms of their habitat affinity, and whether the pattern of occurrence of alien species in European habitats interacts with macroecological factors such as insularity, latitude or area. Results The highest numbers of alien plant and insect species were found in human‐made, urban or cultivated habitats; if controlled for habitat area in the region, wetland and riparian habitats appeared to support relatively high numbers of alien plant species too. Invasions by vertebrates were more evenly distributed among habitats, with aquatic and riparian, woodland and cultivated land most invaded. Mires, bogs and fens, grassland, heathland and scrub were generally less invaded. Habitat and taxonomic group explained most variation in the proportions of alien species occurring in individual habitats related to the total number of alien species in a region, and the basic pattern determined by these factors was fine‐tuned by geographical variables, namely by the mainland–island contrast and latitude, and differed among taxonomic groups. Main conclusions There are two ecologically distinct groups of alien species (plants and insects versus vertebrates) with strikingly different habitat affinities. Invasions by these two contrasting groups are complementary in terms of habitat use, which makes an overall assessment of habitat invasions in Europe possible. Since numbers of naturalized species in habitats are correlated among taxa within these two groups, the data collected for one group of vertebrates, for example, could be used to estimate the habitat‐specific numbers of alien species for other vertebrate groups with reasonable precision, and the same holds true for insects and plants.",1,0,0.020714995,openalex

Intensive sampling on ten of the islands, using an assortment of passive traps and limited hand collecting, resulted in the capture of 6,194 specimens, comprising 128 species. Among these species were seven new state records for Massachusetts (Acupalpus nanellus, Amara aulica, Amara bifrons, Apenes lucidulus, Bradycellus tantillus, Harpalus rubripes and Laemostenus terricola terricola-the last also a new country record; in passing we report also new state records for Harpalus rubripes from New York and Pennsylvania, Amara ovata from Pennsylvania, and the first mainland New York records for Asaphidion curtum). For most islands, there was a clear relationship between species richness and island area. Two islands, however, Calf and Grape, had far more species than their relatively small size would predict. Freshwater marshes on these islands, along with a suite of hygrophilous species, suggested that habitat diversity plays an important role in island species richness. Introduced species (18) comprised 14.0% of the total observed species richness, compared to 5.5% (17 out of 306 species) documented for Rhode Island. We surmise that the higher proportion of introduced species on the islands is, in part, due to a higher proportion of disturbed and open habitats as well as high rates of human traffic. We predict that more active sampling in specialized habitats would bring the total carabid fauna of the Boston Harbor Islands closer to that of Rhode Island or eastern Massachusetts in richness and composition; however, isolation, human disturbance and traffic, and limited habitat diversity all contribute to reducing the species pool on the islands relative to that on the mainland. © Robert L.

Within each stream, three positions (upper, middle and lower reaches) were delimited and within each position two areas were selected. Within each area two plots (each composed of six microplots of 0.2 m2) were sampled, one in the within-stream habitat (submerged all year round), and the other in the stream-border habitat (submerged only in winter). We found that species composition of the riparian bryophytes is affected by the habitat and position in the stream, but not by the main aspect (northern versus southern slope). Concerning species richness, we found that the stream-border community was clearly richer than the within-stream community, upstream plots were richer than plots downstream, and plots on the northern slope of the island were richer than plots on the southern slope. Habitat type was the most significant factor in determining the richness of the threatened species with more species present in the stream-border habitat. Additive partitioning showed that the between-stream component contributed most to total species richness, especially to the richness of the infrequent and threatened species. However, for the common species, the lowest level, i.e. the within-area component, was the most important. Although northern upstream areas are climatically favourable for many bryophyte species due to their higher humidity, the clear effects found may not only be climate-induced, as these areas are also less disturbed and mostly covered by the natural laurel forest. In the southern, downstream parts only a few species were present. Human impacts are largest in the latter situations and probably contributed to the low species richness. As the streams differed considerably in terms of their bryophyte flora, and most of the species were rare, changes in the riparian areas can greatly affect the bryoflora. Therefore, in order to protect the riparian bryophytes as comprehensively as possible, we emphasize the need for careful monitoring of any changes. © 2010 British Bryological Society.",1,0,0.007894972,positives

We applied culture and molecular methods to investigate fungal diversity at the terminus of this glacier. Analysis of the mycoflora composition showed that the Walker Glacier isolates separated into two clusters: the surface of the glacier ice and the glacier foreland. The recently exposed sediments of the foreland had a lower fungal diversity and different species from those on the ice, with the exception of five species that occurred in both habitats. This loss of glacial ice in the Arctic is therefore resulting in the loss of habitats for cold-dwelling fungal species. Fungal diversity is a potentially rich biological resource of glacial ecosystems, with unique taxa.

Assessing and modeling the structure and characteristics of forests, e.g., Leaf Area Index (LAI), volume, biomass, etc., can lead to a better understanding and management of these resources. In recent years, Terrestrial Laser Scanning (TLS) has been recognized as a tool that addresses many of the limitations of manual and traditional forest data collection methods. In this study, we propose a density-based approach for estimating the LAI in a structurally-complex forest environment, which contains variable and diverse structural attributes, e.g., non-circular stem forms, dense canopy and below-canopy vegetation cover, and a diverse species composition. In addition, 242 TLS scans were collected using a portable low-cost scanner, the Compact Biomass Lidar (CBL), in the Hawaii Volcanoes National Park (HAVO), Hawaii Island, USA. LAI also was measured for 242 plots in the site, using an AccuPAR LP-80 ceptometer. The first step after cleaning the point cloud involved detecting the higher forest canopy in the light detection and ranging (lidar) point clouds, using normal change rate assessment. We then estimated Leaf Area Density (LAD), using a voxel-based approach, and divided the canopy point cloud into five layers in the Z (vertical) direction. These five layers subsequently were divided into voxels in the X direction, where the size of these voxels were obtained based on inter-quartile analysis and the number of points in each voxel. We hypothesized that the intensity returned to the lidar system from woody materials, like branches, would be higher than from leaves, due to the liquid water absorption feature of the leaves and higher reflectance for woody material at the 905 nm laser wavelength. We also differentiated between foliar and woody materials using edge detection in the images from projected point clouds and evaluated the density of these regions to support our hypothesis. Density of points, or the number of points divided by the volume of a grid, in a 3D grid size of 0.1 m, was calculated for each of the voxels. The grid size was determined by investigating the size of the branches in the lower portion of the canopy. Subsequently, we fitted a Kernel Density Estimator (KDE) to these values, with the threshold set based on half of the area under the curve in each of the density distributions. All the grids with a density below the threshold were labeled as leaves, while those grids above the threshold were identified as non-leaves. Finally, we modeled LAI using the point densities derived from the TLS point clouds and the listed analysis steps. This model resulted in an R 2 value of 0.88. We also estimated the LAI directly from lidar data using the point densities and calculating LAD, which is defined as the total one-sided leaf area per unit volume. LAI can be obtained as the sum of the LAD values in all the voxels. The accuracy of LAI estimation was 90%, with an RMSE value of 0.31, and an average overestimation of 9 % in TLS-derived LAI, when compared to field-measured LAI. Algorithm performance mainly was affected by the vegetation density and complexity of the canopy structures. It is worth noting that, since the LAI values cannot be considered spatially independent throughout all the plots in this site, we performed semivariogram analysis on the field-measured LAI data. This analysis showed that the LAI values can be assumed to be independent in plots that are at least 30 m apart. As a result, we divided the data into six subsets in which the plots were 30 m spaced. The R 2 values for these subsets, based on modeling of the field-measured LAI using leaf point density values, ranged between 0.84–0.96. The results bode well for using this method for efficient, automatic, and accurate/precise estimation of LAI values in complex forest environments, using a low-cost, rapid-scan TLS.",1,0,0.16061129,openalex

Marine populations are typically open, and local production may have little impact on local recruitment, such that long-distance dispersal is an important determinant of population ecology. Since oceanic islands form discrete patches of habitat surrounded by a structurally different environment, we tested the general hypothesis that processes operating at the scale of islands have a greater influence on these populations than the processes operating at smaller, intra-island scales. A hierarchical design examined the patterns of abundance and distribution of conspicuous taxa at 3 tidal heights at a range of spatial scales, ranging from a few meters to hundreds of kilometres apart in the rocky intertidal of the Azores. Both uni- and multivariate analyses showed that at the largest scale (islands), significant variation was detected in the lower and mid-shore communities, but not on the upper shore. Along the vertical gradient of immersion there was a trend for increasing small-scale patchiness towards the top of the shore. The potential role of local environmental stress gradients and broad-scale oceanographic patterns of recruitment in structuring these assemblages is discussed. This study corroborates the suitability of the analytical tools used here to examine patterns of distribution over a range of spatial scales and its applicability in the field of island marine ecology.

Results: Moderate levels of genetic diversity (H E = 0.522 to 0.628) were found in all populations except in Jeju Island, South Korea, where the diversity was lowest(H E= 0.386). Western populations showed relatively low genetic diversity and higher degrees of genetic differentiation compared with eastern populations (mean Ar = 3.54 (east), 2.81 (west), mean F ST = 0.122). Bayesian-based clustering analysis revealed the existence of three genetically distinct groups (clusters) for Siberian roe deer, which comprise of the Southeastern group (Mainland Korea, Russian Far East, Trans-Baikal region and Northern part of Mongolia), Northwestern group (Western Siberia and Ural in Russia) and Jeju Island population. Genetic analyses including AMOVA (F RT = 0.200), Barrier and PCA also supported genetic differentiation among regions separated primarily by major mountain ridges, suggesting that mountains played a role in the genetic differentiation of Siberian roe deer. On the other hand, genetic evidence also suggests an ongoing migration that may facilitate genetic admixture at the border areas between two groups. Conclusions: Our results reveal an apparent pattern of genetic differentiation among populations inhabiting Asia, showing moderate levels of genetic diversity with an east-west gradient. The results suggest at least three distinct management units of roe deer in continental Asia, although genetic admixture is evident in some border areas. The insights obtained from this study shed light on management of Siberian roe deer in Asia and may be applied in conservation of local populations of Siberian roe deer. © 2015 Lee et al.",1,0,0.6781325,positives

They live in a variety of settings, from sandy to rocky and pebble beaches, to river and lake banks, and to leaf litter and caves. A common feature is the absence of a planktonic larval stage to facilitate passive dispersal over long-distances. However, some species have broad distributions. Genetic studies over the past 25 years have tried to explain this apparent contradiction by assessing patterns of species genetic structuring on different geographical scales. Here, we review the molecular studies available to date and focus on the population genetics of talitrids. Most of these studies considered populations in the Mediterranean area, but also along the Atlantic coast and in Canary Island caves. From this review, the group emerges as a potential model to understand processes of dispersal and divergence in non-highly-vagile supralittoral organisms. At the same time, studies on these issues are still too restricted geographically: a worldwide scale including different regions would provide us with a better perspective on these problems.
 
 La famiglia Talitridae è l’unica, all’interno dell’ordine Amphipoda, ad essere rappresentata da specie che hanno colonizzato l’ambiente emerso. Queste si possono trovare in una grande varietà di habitat: dalle spiagge sabbiose, rocciose e ciottolose, alle rive dei fiumi e dei laghi, fino alle lettiere delle foreste umide o agli ambienti cavernicoli. Una caratteristica comune a tutti gli anfipodi è l’assenza di uno stadio larvale planctonico che faciliti o promuova una dispersione passiva su distanze medio-lunghe. Nonostante questo, alcune specie presentano un areale piuttosto esteso. Gli studi genetici condotti negli ultimi 25 anni hanno cercato di spiegare questa apparente contraddizione attraverso stime ed analisi della struttura genetica di specie diverse su scale geografiche più o meno estese. In questo lavoro ci proponiamo quindi di riassumere gli studi molecolari condotti sino ad oggi ed aventi come oggetto la genetica di popolazione degli anfipodi talitridi. La maggior parte dei lavori a disposizione in letteratura considera popolazioni e specie dell’area Mediterranea, ma alcuni coprono anche le coste atlantiche nord-orientali e le grotte delle isole Canarie. Da questi studi emerge chiaramente la grande potenzialità dei talitridi come gruppo-modello ideale per comprendere i processi di dispersione e di divergenza in organismi caratterizzati da bassi livelli di vagilità. Allo stesso tempo, le conclusioni fin qui ottenute si riferiscono ad aree geografiche relativamente limitate: da qui la necessità di ampliare la scala spaziale. Questi lavori rappresenterebbero un contributo sostanziale, consentendo, da un lato, di migliorare la nostra conoscenza dei modelli di strutturazione genetica di questo gruppo di crostacei, e dall’altro di meglio comprendere le dinamiche evolutive che regolano le comunità degli ambienti costieri.",1,0,0.064936385,openalex

However, there are few direct comparisons of the structure and functioning of scavenging communities in different ecosystems. Here, we monitored the consumption of 23 fish (seabream Sparus aurata) and 34 bird (yellow-legged gull Larus michahellis) carcasses on a small Mediterranean island (Isla Grosa, southeastern Spain) and surrounding waters in summer to compare the structure of the scavenger assemblages and their carrion consumption efficiencies in terrestrial and shallow water habitats. Scavenging was highly efficient both in marine and terrestrial environments, especially in the presence of a highly abundant vertebrate scavenger species, the yellow-legged gull. The vertebrate scavenger community was richer in the marine environment, whereas the invertebrate community was richer on land. The scavenger network was usually well-structured (i.e., nested), with the exception of the community associated with fish terrestrial carcasses, which were almost monopolized by yellow-legged gulls. In contrast, gulls left conspecific carcasses untouched, thus allowing longer persistence of gull carcasses on land and their exploitation by a diverse insect community. Our study shows important differences in the scavenging process associated with environment and carcass type. Promising avenues for further eco-evolutionary and applied research arise from the comparison of scavenging processes in terrestrial and marine ecosystems, from small islands to continents.",1,0,0.016361946,openalex

The northern South China Sea is rich in intertidal crabs, but the research progress varies considerably across different regions. Compared with eastern Guangdong, Beibu Gulf, and Hainan Island, our understanding of the intertidal crab fauna in western Guangdong remains relatively limited. To bridge this knowledge gap, it is crucial to explore the intertidal crab fauna on Donghai Island and Naozhou Island, located on eastern side of the Leizhou Peninsula. These islands play a vital role in unveiling the nearshore zoobenthic biogeography of western Guangdong and the northern South China Sea. In this study, we present the findings of a comprehensive field survey and incorporate previous studies to report on the species diversity and distribution patterns of intertidal crabs from these two islands. Methods: During the period of 2021–2022, intertidal crabs were collected from 22 sampling sites located Donghai Island and Naozhou Island. And the taxon recoded in previous studies were revised by literature review. A comprehensive and current checklist of intertidal crabs in the two islands was conducted, and an analysis was conducted to determine the distribution patterns of each species along the coasts of the China Seas. Results: A total of 91 species of brachyuran crabs were collected, representing 26 families and 62 genera during the field survey. Within this collection, 52 species were previously undocumented in the study area. The updated checklist now encompasses 150 intertidal crab species, originating from 33 families and 91 genera. Out of them, 108 species (72.0%) are characterized as the tropical and/or subtropical, with their distribution spanning from the northern South China Sea to the Taiwan Strait or the East China Sea. The remaining 42 species (28.0%) are considered widespread, with each of them being found across from the northern South China Sea to the Yellow and Bohai Seas. The intertidal brachyuran fauna of the study area is tightly related to other areas of the South China Sea. Among these 150 species, 136 species (90.7%) have also been documented on Hainan Island, 124 species (82.7%) in the Beibu Gulf, 123 species (82.0%) on Taiwan Island, and 109 species (72.7%) in Southeast Asia. Conclusions: The results indicate a strong connection between the intertidal crab population on the eastern coast of Leizhou Peninsula and the northern coast of Hainan Island. Both regions fall within the Subtropical Provinces in terms of nearshore zoobenthic biota. Interestingly, it appears that neither the Leizhou Peninsula nor the Qiongzhou Strait significantly hinder the dispersal of intertidal crabs. The results offer fresh perspectives on the biogeographical classification of nearshore zoobenthic biota in China, as well as the sustainable utilization and preservation of marine biological resources. © 2023, Chinese Academy of Sciences.

Scotland, were compared using a combination of observations at haul-out sites, VHF and satellite-link telemetry, and analyses of diet composition. 2. Terrestrial abundance of both grey and harbour seals was highest during the summer but there were marked differences in the extent to which the two species moved between different haul-out sites. Harbour seals showed local seasonal changes in distribution, but all 21 radio-tagged seals moved only to alternative haul-out sites within a range of 75km. In contrast, four of the five grey seals tracked from the Moray Firth moved to haul-out sites 125-365 km away, and provided evidence of interchange between the Moray Firth and other grey seal breeding areas in Orkney, the Fifth of Forth and the Farne Islands. 3. All harbour seals foraged within 60 km of their haul-out sites, but showed seasonal variation in their foraging areas which was related to changes in their terrestrial distribution. In contrast, those grey seals which foraged within the Moray Firth travelled up to 145 km from haul-out sites. Nevertheless, there was some overlap in the foraging areas used by harbour seals and grey seals in more inshore areas. 4. Sandeels, gadoids, flatfish and cephalopods formed over 95% of the diet of both species. However, dietary data, particularly for grey seals, may be biased toward those individuals which fed in more inshore areas. 5. These results suggest that Moray Firth harbour seals can be considered as a relatively discrete population, with clear links between breeding, feeding and resting areas, and little exchange of adults between this and adjacent breeding areas in Orkney and the Tay Estuary. In contrast, grey seals from several different breeding sites appear to move into the Moray Firth in summer and use the area primarily for foraging and non-breeding haul-out.",1,0,0.014708711,openalex

Isolation of biological communities on reservoir islands induces local extinctions and degradation of remnant communities. ""Good practice"" dam development guidelines propose using reservoir islands for species conservation, mitigating some of the detrimental impacts associated with flooding terrestrial habitats. The degree of species retention on islands in the long-term, and hence, whether they are effective for conservation is currently unknown. Here, we quantitatively review species' responses to isolation on reservoir islands. We specifically investigate island species richness in comparison with neighbouring continuous habitat, and relationships between island species richness and island area, isolation time, and distance to mainland and to other islands. Species' responses to isolation on reservoir islands have been investigated in only 15 of the > 58,000 large-dam reservoirs (dam height > 15m) operating globally. Research predominantly originates from wet tropical forest habitats and focuses on mammals, with species richness being the most widely-reported ecological metric. Terrestrial taxa are, overall, negatively impacted by isolation on reservoir islands. Reservoir island species richness declines with isolation time, and although the rate of loss is slower on larger islands, all islands exhibit depauperate species richness < 100 years after isolation, compared to continuous mainland habitats. Such a pattern of sustained and delayed species loss following large-scale habitat disturbance is indicative of an extinction debt existing for reservoir island species: this pattern is evident across all taxonomic groups and dams studied. Thus, reservoir islands cannot reliably be used for species conservation as part of impact mitigation measures, and should instead be included in area calculations for land impacted by dam creation. Environmental licensing assessments as a precondition for future dam development should explicitly consider the long-term fate of island communities when assessing biodiversity loss vs energy output. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.",1,0,0.011197634,positives

Louisiana's barrier islands provide unique habitats for waterbirds throughout the year. Unfortunately, barrier islands such as those within the Isles Dernieres Barrier Island Refuge (IDBIR) are rapidly degrading, and critical waterbird habitats are disappearing. The majority of waterbird research projects in the northern Gulf of Mexico have focused on important breeding habitats, but little information exists on preferred habitats during the nonbreeding wintering period. The goal of this study was to identify important waterbird habitats on barrier islands during the nonbreeding period to enhance barrier island management for year-round use by waterbirds. Biweekly surveys were conducted at the IDBIR during the 2010-2011 and 2011-2012 nonbreeding seasons to determine waterbird use of beach habitats. Habitat maps of the IDBIR were also created to calculate bird densities and species richness among habitat types, including bayside intertidal, flats, gulfside intertidal, nonintertidal, and rock structures. This study also quantified availability of food resources by collecting benthic core samples from substrates at each habitat type. Forty-seven waterbird species were observed during waterbird surveys. Wine Island had the greatest species richness and bird density (5.5 species/ha and 325.6 birds/ha) among the islands, as well as the greatest density of foraging waterbirds. Rock structures and gulfside intertidal habitats had the greatest species richness and bird densities among habitat types. East and West Raccoon islands and intertidal habitats had the greatest availability of invertebrate prey. There was a moderate correlation (r2 = 0.32) between invertebrate biomass and abundance of foraging shorebirds.

In ice-affected Arctic regions, seasonal or permanent ice cover provides a bridging mechanism for dispersal, allowing water gaps to be crossed more rapidly and with less energy cost than is entailed in swimming. Consequently, islands that might be out of reach if waters were open become much more readily colonised in the presence of ice. We reviewed the distribution of terrestrial mammals on selected islands throughout the Arctic and analyse historical data for several sites in the Canadian Arctic where mammal populations have undergone extirpation and re-colonisation. We use these data to assess the value of ice for the dispersal of Arctic terrestrial mammals. Given observed dispersal distances we estimate the likely impact of future ice reduction on island faunas. We predict that, as ice cover duration shortens, immigration will decline leading to increased extinctions of island populations and potentially, in the long-term, local genetic differentiation. The eventual disappearance of ice bridges, preventing the immigration of southern species, may leave certain arctic archipelagos as the last refuge for typical Arctic mammals.",1,0,0.2742618,openalex

 Questions
 Abandonment of anthropogenic ecosystems threatens biodiversity in rural areas globally. Successional responses in anthropogenic ecosystems have been shown to differ from those in natural ecosystems because of the legacy of continuous management activities. However, few studies have focused on successional changes in anthropogenic freshwater ecosystems following abandonment. Focusing on two drivers (water depletion and cessation of anthropogenic disturbance), we tested whether water depletion plays a larger role than years since abandonment in determining the both plant functional diversity and composition in farm ponds.
 
 Location
 Awaji Island, western Japan.
 
 Methods
 We investigated flora at 200 farm ponds, which had experienced long-term continuous anthropogenic disturbance. We interviewed 100 managers of the surveyed ponds and local farmers to identify the ponds’ management status. To capture community processes during succession, we focused on functional richness and functional trait composition. We assessed the relative contribution of the two successional drivers in determining functional richness by adopting a linear model. We classified the survey ponds into five groups based on the two successional drivers and performed PERMANOVA to test differences in functional composition among the groups.
 
 Results
 Water depletion played a larger role than elapsed time since cessation of anthropogenic disturbance in determining functional richness. Functional composition of water-depleted ponds significantly differed from that of managed ponds, regardless of years since abandonment.
 
 Conclusions
 Our results indicate that water depletion has a larger effect on successional changes in ponds than cessation of anthropogenic disturbance; that is, water depletion drives succession and overrides the legacy of continuous anthropogenic disturbance. The results suggest that, in freshwater ecosystems, the functional change in a community is greater in the transition from macrophytes to terrestrial plants than it is in the transition from stress-tolerant species to competitive species.",1,0,0.0031654674,openalex

However, the full scope of biodiversity and the niche-neutral processes underlying these communities remain unclear. In this study, we combine multivariate analyses, co-occurrence networks and fitted species abundance distributions on an extensive set of bacterial, micro-eukaryote and archaeal amplicon sequencing data to unravel soil microbiome patterns of nine sites across two east Antarctic regions, the Vestfold Hills and Windmill Islands. To our knowledge, this is the first microbial biodiversity report on the hyperarid Vestfold Hills soil environment. Results Our findings reveal distinct regional differences in phylogenetic composition, abundance and richness amongst microbial taxa. Actinobacteria dominated soils in both regions, yet Bacteroidetes were more abundant in the Vestfold Hills compared to the Windmill Islands, which contained a high abundance of novel phyla. However, intra-region comparisons demonstrate greater homogeneity of soil microbial communities and measured environmental parameters between sites at the Vestfold Hills. Community richness is largely driven by a variable suite of parameters but robust associations between co-existing members highlight potential interactions and sharing of niche space by diverse taxa from all three microbial domains of life examined. Overall, non-neutral processes appear to structure the polar soil microbiomes studied here, with niche partitioning being particularly strong for bacterial communities at the Windmill Islands. Eukaryotic and archaeal communities reveal weaker niche-driven signatures accompanied by multimodality, suggesting the emergence of neutrality. Conclusion We provide new information on assemblage patterns, environmental drivers and non-random occurrences for Antarctic soil microbiomes, particularly the Vestfold Hills, where basic diversity, ecology and life history strategies of resident microbiota are largely unknown.

 To enhance our knowledge of the diversity of microalgae, a phycological survey of the Canary Islands (Spain) was undertaken. Here we report the discovery of a (semi)terrestrial green filamentous alga isolated from a steep volcanic canyon on La Palma. This alga is continually exposed to changing weather conditions (floods vs. droughts) and thus provides a good opportunity to investigate possible adaptations to a semiterrestrial habitat with large fluctuations of environmental parameters.
 
 METHODS:
 We used axenic cultures, simulated flood and drought stresses and studied their effect on the life history of the alga using light, confocal laser scanning and scanning electron microscopy including fluorescent staining. Furthermore, phylogenetic analyses using rDNA sequence comparisons were performed.
 
 KEY RESULTS:
 Three specific life-history traits that likely represent adaptations to the fluctuating environment of the canyon were observed: (1) fragmentation through “filament splitting”, a unique branching mechanism not reported before in algae and initiated by formation of oblique cross walls, (2) aplanospore formation, and (3) reproduction by multiflagellate zoospores with 4–24 flagella arranged in groups of four. Phylogenetic analyses identified the alga as Barranca multiflagellata gen. et sp. nov. (Barrancaceae fam. nov., Chaetophorales, Chlorophyceae). Moreover, the Chaetophoraceae Greville, 1824 was emended and a new family, Uronemataceae (fam. nov.) erected.
 
 CONCLUSIONS:
 The discovery of Barrancaceae fam. nov. highlights the importance of investigating nonconventional habitats to explore microalgal diversity. The reproductive versatility demonstrated by Barranca suggests adaptation to a semiterrestrial habitat with large fluctuations in water availability.",1,0,0.02786553,openalex

We found that the micrometazoans inhabiting the algae consist of remarkably abundant bdelloid rotifers (subclass Bdelloidea), followed by tardigrades. We did not find nematodes. The rotifer assemblages were characterized by low diversity (only six species). Nevertheless, rotifer densities were extremely high: mean densities ranged from 75 to 3030 individuals per 100 mg of the dry sample weight and the maximum value numbered in excess of 8000 per 100 mg of the dry sample weight. These data show that terrestrial algae, along with mosses, are a very attractive habitat for rotifers and tardigrades in the Antarctic. The statistical analysis showed a lack of correlations between rotifer and tardigrade densities and nutrients (N, C, P, K and Na).

To inform biodiversity management in FWS treating agricultural runoff, we surveyed the vegetation and fauna assemblages in five established FWS in a lowland, pastoral landscape in the central North Island, New Zealand. The FWS had been established for between 3 and 19 years, planted with a restricted range of native plant species, and fenced to exclude livestock access. Larger wetlands hosted significantly more plant and mammal species. However, other than wetland size, we found few other significant relationships between wetland habitat, landscape characteristics, and measures of biodiversity (total species, proportion of native species, number of wetland specialists, or threatened species). We recorded one-hundred and thirteen plant, twenty bird, five mammal, eighty-five terrestrial invertebrates, forty-seven aquatic invertebrates, six fish, and two amphibian species inhabiting the FWS. Native species comprised 96% of the total aquatic invertebrate fauna identified. For other taxa, native flora and fauna accounted for half or less than half of all species identified: 53% terrestrial invertebrates, 50% fish, 45% birds, 32% plants, and 0% amphibian and mammal species. Few wetland specialists (aquatic or wetland-adapted) or threatened native species were detected, probably reflecting the limited range of wetland plant species in initial plantings and the difficulties native taxa face when colonising new habitat where potential reservoirs of colonist species are also depauperate or too distant. FWS support native biodiversity, but further enhancements may require active management of exotic and pest species to minimise competition or predation on native species.",1,0,0.22601943,openalex

 Phylogenetic endemism (PE) identifies geographic concentrations of evolutionarily isolated and spatially restricted biota. Locations with high PE hold elements of biodiversity with little representation elsewhere and whose loss would impact disproportionately on phylogenetic diversity. We aim to determine the global distribution of PE for the world's mammals and to test hypotheses regarding the role of past and present environment and isolation in creating current patterns of evolutionary and spatial isolation.
 
 Location
 Global land.
 
 Methods
 IUCN range polygons were combined with a mammal supertree to estimate PE and related measures at three resolutions. We tested the relationship between PE and predictors representing current and Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) environment and isolation in a model selection framework, for all terrestrial mammals and separately for bats.
 
 Results
 We identified 12 centres of mammal PE, with implications for conservation decisions. Endemism of mammal evolutionary diversity peaks predominantly in tropical and Southern Hemisphere island and montane regions. PE was most strongly associated with energy availability, isolation, elevation and low variability of current climate. Post LGM climate stability was a surprisingly weak predictor of PE compared with LGM climate itself. When controlling for current species ranges, PE is more strongly explained by past climate and past isolation.
 
 Main conclusions
 While present conditions better explain species endemism, past climate and isolation are central to explaining PE. Isolation at the LGM was a significantly stronger predictor of PE than current isolation, confirming the key role of persistent barriers, even narrow ones such as Wallace's Line. This global evaluation of PE offers an innovative and effective way to capture and test the evolutionary underpinning of whole-clade biogeography. With improving spatial and phylogenetic information, integrative measures such as PE offer a substantial contribution toward comprehending and conserving evolutionary diversity.",1,0,0.26783285,openalex

To better understand the diversity and distribution of Antarctic terrestrial algae, we performed a pilot study on the surface soils of Meseta, an ice-free plateau mountain crest of Fildes Peninsula, King George Island, being hardly influenced by the marine realm and anthropogenic disturbances. It is openly exposed to microbial colonization from outside Antarctica and connected to the much harsher and dryer ice-free zones of the continental Antarctic. A temperate reference site under mild land use, SchF, was included to further test for the Meseta algae distribution in a contrasting environment. We employed a paired-end metabarcoding analysis based on amplicons of the highly variable nuclear-encoded ITS2 rDNA region, complemented by a clone library approach. It targeted the four algal classes, Chlorophyceae, Trebouxiophyceae, Ulvophyceae, and Xanthophyceae, representing key groups of cold-adapted soil algae. A surprisingly high diversity of 830 algal OTUs was revealed, assigned to 58 genera in the four targeted algal classes. Members of the green algal class Trebouxiophyceae predominated in the soil algae communities. The major part of the algal biodiversity, 86.1% of all algal OTUs, could not be identified at the species level due to insufficient representation in reference sequence databases. The classes Ulvophyceae and Xanthophyceae exhibited the most unknown species diversity. About 9% of the Meseta algae species diversity was shared with that of the temperate reference site in Germany. In the small portion of algal OTUs for which their distribution could be assessed, the entire ITS2 sequence identity with references shows that the soil algae likely have a wide distribution beyond the Polar regions. They probably originated from soil algae propagule banks in far southern regions, transported by aeolian transport over long distances.

In this study, natural recovery of a local marine food web from a historic terrestrial source of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) at Saglek Bay is examined. PCBs were measured in marine sediments, shorthorn sculpin (Myoxocephalus scorpius), and black guillemots (Cepphus grylle) to assess ecosystem recovery over an eight-year period after cleanup of the source. Surface sediment measurements indicate decreases in both the extent and average concentrations of PCBs throughout Saglek Bay. Sculpin collected near the former contaminated beach in 2006 had significantly lower PCB burdens than those collected in 1998/99. PCB levels have also decreased significantly in black guillemot nestlings collected from the former contaminated beach area, as well as Island (6−8 km from the source) and Reference (greater than 18 km from the source) locations. This study demonstrates the utility of using indicator species, especially the black guillemot, to monitor PCB uptake in benthic food webs.

We hypothesised that: (1) topography, accessibility and spatial isolation drive the diversity and composition of plant communities in the CBNP and that (2) isolated areas contribute to high floristic regional diversity by supporting unique species assemblages. We expected high tree species diversity within the tropical limestone forests of the CBNP, but also that: (3) the abundance of non-tree species negatively affects tree regeneration diversity and abundance. Data were obtained from 90 random sample plots (500 m2) and 450 sub-sample plots (25 m2) in three areas of the CBNP. We differentiated four different plant species communities and found a total of 302 species belonging to 112 families. Tree species contributed 50% to total species richness. The distribution of different plant communities in the CBNP was driven mainly by topography; that is, the percentage of rock surface and slope and concomitant differences in soil depth. Contrary to our expectations, isolated areas did not contribute greatly to the CBNP’s plant species diversity. It seems that isolated areas and, as in our case, rough topography, may act as natural barriers to seed dispersal, creating an environmental filter for tree species. Across the CBNP, there was no effect of non-tree species on tree species regeneration, but regeneration patterns differed between communities. In species-rich communities growing under favourable site conditions (e.g. low rock surface and slope), greater coverage by non-tree species had an increasingly negative effect on tree species richness and abundance in the regeneration layer. The opposite was observed in communities growing under harsh site conditions. We conclude that plant species diversity in the CBNP is high, particularly in easily accessible lowland areas where tree species contribute greatly to biodiversity. However, here, non-tree species can even restrict tree regeneration. Copyright Van Vien Pham et al.",1,0,0.002724524,positives

Due to the heterogeneous distribution of vegetation elements, structural complexity underpins ecological dynamics, species composition, microclimate, and habitat diversity. Field measurements and Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data, such as airborne (ALS) and terrestrial (TLS), can assess structural characteristics of forest and agroforestry systems at various spatial scales. This assessment is urgently needed for monitoring ecosystem restoration in degraded lands (e.g., in oil palm landscapes), where it is not well-known how structural measures derived from these different approaches relate to each other. Here, we compared the degree of correlation between individual and multivariate datasets of vegetation structural complexity metrics derived from ALS, TLS, and ground-based inventory approaches. The study was conducted in a 140 ha oil palm monoculture, enriched with 52 plots in the form of tree islands representing agroforestry systems of varying sizes and planted diversity levels in Sumatra, Indonesia. Our datasets comprised 25 ALS, five TLS, and nine ground-based inventory metrics. We studied correlations among metrics related to traditional stand summary, heterogeneity, and vertical and horizontal stand structure. We used principal component analysis for data dimensionality reduction, correlation analysis to quantify the strength of relationships between metrics, and Procrustes analysis to investigate the agreement between datasets. Significant correlations were found between ALS and TLS metrics for canopy density (r = 0.79) and maximum tree height (r = 0.58) and between ALS and ground-based inventory measures of stand heterogeneity and height diversity (r between 0.60 and −0.63). Further, we observed significant agreements between the ordinations of multivariate datasets (r = 0.56 for ALS − TLS; and r = 0.46 for ALS – ground-based inventory). Our findings underline the ability of ALS to capture structural complexity patterns, especially for canopy gap dynamics and vegetation height metrics, as captured by TLS, and for measures of heterogeneity and vertical structure as captured by ground-based inventories. Our study highlights the strength of each approach and underscores the potential of integrating ALS and TLS with ground-based inventories for a comprehensive characterization of vegetation structure in complex agroforestry systems, which can provide guidance for their management and support ecosystem restoration monitoring efforts.",1,0,0.264789,openalex

Many studies related the invasion of dune habitats to anthropic causes, but less is known about the role of soil properties and plant traits in plant invasion. In this study, we tested the relationships between soil features and alien plant invasion in dune systems, focusing on the interplay between soil nutrients, soil salinity and plant functional traits. Methods Study sites were sandy barrier islands of the Marano and Grado lagoon (northern Adriatic Sea). One hundred plots (4 m × 4 m) were selected within 10 areas according to the main habitats occurring along the ecological gradient of dune system (foredune, backdune and saltmarsh). In each plot, we recorded all plant species occurrence and abundance and we collected a soil core. For each soil sample, soil texture, conductivity (as proxy of soil salinity), organic carbon and nitrogen content were analyzed and related to the species number and cover of native and alien plants. Variation of main reproductive and vegetative functional traits among habitats was also analyzed for both alien and native species. Important Findings Soil properties were strongly related to overall plant diversity, by differently affecting alien and native species pools. In backdune, the most invaded habitat, a high soil conductivity limited the number of alien species, whereas the content of soil organic carbon increased along with alien plant abundance, suggesting also the occurrence of potential feedback processes between plant invasion and soil. We found a significant convergence between native and alien plant functional trait spectra only in backdune habitat, where environmental conditions ameliorate and plant competition increases. Our findings suggest that in harsh conditions only native specialized plants can thrive while at intermediate conditions, soil properties gradient acts in synergy with plant traits to curb/facilitate alien plant richness. © The Author(s) 2020.

Location: Global. Methods: Meta-analysis and phylogenetic regressions based on 216 studies were used to examine the effects of 96 non-native plant species on species richness of resident plants and animals while considering differences in non-native species traits (life-form, clonality or vegetative reproduction, and nitrogen-fixing ability) and characteristics of the invaded site (ecosystem type, insularity and climatic region). Results: Plots with non-native plants had lower resident plant (-20.5%) and animal species richness (-26.4%) than paired uninvaded control plots. Nitrogen-fixing ability, followed by phylogeny and clonality were the best predictors of the magnitude of impacts of non-native plants on native plant species richness. Non-nitrogen-fixing and clonal non-native plants reduced species richness more than nitrogen-fixing and non-clonal invaders. However, life-form and characteristics of the invaded sites did not appear to be important. In the case of resident animal species richness, only the phylogenetic position of the non-native and whether invaded sites were islands or not influenced impacts, with a more pronounced decrease found on islands than mainlands. Main conclusions: The presence of a phylogenetic signal on the magnitude of the impacts of non-native plants on resident plant and animal richness indicates that closely related non-native plants tend to have similar impacts. This suggests that the magnitude of the impact might depend on shared plant traits not explored in our study. Our results therefore support the need to include the phylogenetic similarity of non-native plants to known invaders in risk assessment analysis. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",1,0,0.09436387,positives

This pattern is generally attributed to ongoing dispersal (by wind, water, or migrating birds) or relict Gondwanan distributions. Few of these terrestrial taxa have extant representatives in Antarctica, but such taxa would contribute to our understanding of the evolutionary origins of the continental Antarctic fauna. Either these taxa have survived the harsh climate cooling in Antarctica over the last 23 Myr (Gondwanan/vicariance origin) or they have dispersed there more recently (<2 MYA). In this context, we examined mtDNA (COI) sequence variation in Cryptopygus and related extant Antarctic and subantarctic terrestrial springtails (Collembola). Sequence divergence was estimated under a maximum likelihood model (general time reversible + I + Γ) between individuals from subantarctic islands, Australia, New Zealand, Patagonia, Antarctic Peninsula, and continental Antarctica. Recent dispersal/colonization (<2 MYA) of Cryptopygus species was inferred between some subantarctic islands, and there was a close association between estimated times of divergences based on a molecular clock and proposed geological ages of islands. Most lineages generally grouped according to geographic proximity or by inferred dispersal/colonization pathways. In contrast, the deep divergences found for the four endemic Antarctic species indicate that they represent a continuous chain of descent dating from the break up of Gondwana to the present. We suggest that the diversification of these springtail species (21–11 MYA) in ice-free glacial refugia throughout the Trans-Antarctic Mountains was caused by the glaciation of the Antarctic continent during the middle to late Miocene.",1,0,0.22466749,openalex

Second edition,"The Society for Ecological Restoration (SER) is an international non-profit organization with members in 70 countries. SER advances the science, practice and policy of ecological restoration to sustain biodiversity, improve resilience in a changing climate, and re-establish an ecologically healthy relationship between nature and culture. SER is a dynamic global network, linking researchers, practitioners, land managers, community leaders and decision-makers to restore ecosystems and the human communities that depend on them. Via its members, publications, conferences, policy work, and outreach, SER defines and delivers excellence in the field of ecological restoration. Document development. International Principles and Standards for the Practice of Ecological Restoration (the Standards) was developed through consultation with professionals within the Society for Ecological Restoration and their peers in the global scientific and conservation communities. The first edition was launched in 2016 at the United Nations Biodiversity Conference in Cancún, Mexico. This event brought together key stakeholders from across the international policy arena, many of whom had been instrumental in driving the global initiatives to implement large-scale environmental restoration programs. Because the Standards were written as a living document to be modified and expanded through consultation and use by stakeholders, the launch included an open invitation for stakeholder input, to both improve the document and promote broad use. Subsequently, over a multi-year consultation period, SER invited input and review from a diverse spectrum of people and organizations contributing to ecological restoration. Key stakeholders contacted for comment included the secretariats of the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD) including its Science-Policy Interface, Global Environment Facility, the World Bank, and members of the Global Partnership on Forest Landscape Restoration (GPFLR). In 2017, SER partnered with the IUCN Commission on Ecosystem Management to deliver an invited Forum on Biodiversity and Global Forest Restoration at which the SER Standards were reviewed (SER and IUCN-CEM 2018). SER also organized a symposium on the SER Standards and an open Knowledge Café at the 2017 SER World Conference on Ecological Restoration. Additional input was received at other events, including the 9th Ecosystem Services Partnership World Conference in Shenzhen, China in 2017. To capture the perspectives of the SER community, SER invited online feedback via its website and sent an online survey to SER members, affiliates, and stakeholders. SER has also considered and responded to feedback from published critiques in its journal, Restoration Ecology. All comments received during the consultative review process were considered in the revision process. The second edition of the Standards was approved by the SER Science and Policy Committee, and the SER Board of Directors on 18 June 2019. As with the first edition, this version will be revised and improved as the discipline evolves through science, practice, and adaptive management. The Standards are compatible with and expand on the Open Standards for the Practice of Conservation (Conservation Measures Partnership 2013) and complement the REDD+ Social and Environmental Standards (REDD+ SES 2012), and other conservation standards and guidelines.

Cassandra Rosa compiled detailed notes and reviewed comments from >100 respondents of the SER survey on the Standards. Ecological restoration, when implemented effectively and sustainably, contributes to protecting biodiversity; improving human health and wellbeing; increasing food and water security; delivering goods, services, and economic prosperity; and supporting climate change mitigation, resilience, and adaptation. It is a solutions-based approach that engages communities, scientists, policymakers, and land managers to repair ecological damage and rebuild a healthier relationship between people and the rest of nature. When combined with conservation and sustainable use, ecological restoration is the link needed to move local, regional, and global environmental conditions from a state of continued degradation, to one of net positive improvement. The second edition of the International Principles and Standards for the Practice of Ecological Restoration (the Standards) presents a robust framework for restoration projects to achieve intended goals, while addressing challenges including effective design and implementation, accounting for complex ecosystem dynamics (especially in the context of climate change), and navigating trade-offs associated with land management priorities and decisions. The Standards establish eight principles that underpin ecological restoration. Principles 1 and 2 articulate important foundations that guide ecological restoration: effectively engaging a wide range of stakeholders, and fully utilizing available scientific, traditional, and local knowledge, respectively. Principles 3 and 4 summarize the central approach to ecological restoration, by highlighting ecologically appropriate reference ecosystems as the target of restoration and clarifying the imperative for restoration activities to support ecosystem recovery processes. Principle 5 underscores the use of measurable indicators to assess progress toward restoration objectives. Principle 6 lays out the mandate for ecological restoration to seek the highest attainable recovery. Tools are provided to identify the levels of recovery aspired to and to track progress. Principle 7 highlights the importance of restoration at large spatial scales for cumulative gains. Finally, ecological restoration is one of several approaches that address damage to ecosystems and Principle 8 clarifies its relationships to allied approaches on a ""Restorative Continuum"". The Standards highlight the role of ecological restoration in connecting social, community, productivity, and sustainability goals. The Standards also provide recommended performance measures for restorative activities for industries, communities, and governments to consider. In addition, the Standards enhance the list of practices and actions that guide practitioners in planning, implementation, and monitoring activities. The leading practices and guidance include discussion on appropriate approaches to site assessment and identification of reference ecosystems, different restoration approaches including natural regeneration, consideration of genetic diversity under climate change, and the role of ecological restoration in global restoration initiatives. This edition also includes an expanded glossary of restoration terminology. SER and its international partners produced the Standards for adoption by communities, industries, governments, educators, and land managers to improve ecological restoration practice across all sectors and in all ecosystems, terrestrial and aquatic. The Standards support development of ecological restoration plans, contracts, consent conditions, and monitoring and auditing criteria. Generic in nature, the Standards framework can be adapted to particular ecosystems, biomes, or landscapes; individual countries; or traditional cultures. The Standards are aspirational and provide tools that are intended to improve outcomes, promote best practices, and deliver net global environmental and social benefits. As the world enters the UN Decade on Ecosystem Restoration (2021–2030), the Standards provide a blueprint for ensuring ecological restoration achieves its full potential in delivering social and environmental equity and, ultimately, economic benefits and outcomes.

BLANK PROJECT EVALUATION TEMPLATES (FOR PRACTITIONER USE)45 The International Principles and Standards for the Practice of Ecological Restoration (the Standards) provide a guide to practitioners, operational personnel, students, planners, managers, regulators, policymakers, funders, and implementing agencies involved in restoring degraded ecosystems across the world—whether terrestrial, freshwater, coastal, or marine. They place ecological restoration into a global context, including its role in recovering biodiversity and improving human wellbeing11 Terms in boldface are defined in the Glossary section. in times of rapid global change. Humanity recognizes the planet's native ecosystems as having irreplaceable ecological, societal, and economic value. In addition to their intrinsic value, such as biodiversity and spiritual or aesthetic importance, healthy native ecosystems assure the flow of ecosystem services. These services include: provision of clean water and air, healthy soils, culturally important artifacts, and the food, fiber, fuel, and medicines essential for human health, wellbeing, and livelihoods. Native ecosystems can also reduce the effects of natural disasters and mitigate accelerated climate change. Ecosystem degradation, damage, and destruction (hereafter, collectively referred to as degradation) diminish the biodiversity, functioning, and resilience of ecosystems, which in turn negatively affects the resilience and sustainability of social–ecological systems. Although protecting remaining native ecosystems is critical to conserving the world's natural and cultural heritage, protection alone is insufficient, given past and current degradation. To respond to current global environmental challenges and to sustain the flow of ecosystem services and goods essential for human wellbeing, global society must secure a net gain in the extent and functioning of native ecosystems by investing not only in environmental protection, but also in environmental repair including ecological restoration. This repair must be implemented at multiple scales to achieve measurable effects worldwide. Awareness of the need for environmental repair is growing, resulting in a global escalation of ecological restoration and related efforts (see also Section 4, Part 3). For example, the United Nations (UN) Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) for 2030 call for restoration of marine and coastal ecosystems (Goal 14) and terrestrial ecosystems (Goal 15) that have been degraded to ""protect, restore and promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, sustainably manage forests, combat desertification, and halt and reverse land degradation and halt biodiversity loss."" The Convention on Biological Diversity (2016) calls for the ""restoration of degraded natural and semi-natural ecosystems, including in urban environments, as a contribution to reversing the loss of biodiversity, recovering connectivity, improving ecosystem resilience, enhancing the provision of ecosystem services, mitigating and adapting to the effects of climate change, combating desertification and land degradation, and improving human well-being while reducing environmental risks and scarcities."" And, the United Nations General Assembly has declared 2021–2030 the ""Decade on Ecosystem Restoration."" The concept of restoration in many of these initiatives and agreements is very broad and includes many approaches to ecosystem management and nature-based solutions, all of which are valuable. The Standards address the relationship between ecological restoration and other ecosystem management and nature-based solutions, and clarify the specific role of ecological restoration in contributing to the goals of conserving biodiversity and improving human wellbeing worldwide. Repairing degraded ecosystems is a complex task requiring significant time, resources, and knowledge. Ecological restoration contributes in substantial ways to protecting biodiversity and human wellbeing, but many restoration projects and programs, however well intentioned, have underperformed. The Standards recognize that appropriate design; good planning and implementation; sufficient knowledge, skill, effort and resources; understanding of specific social contexts and risks; appropriate stakeholder involvement; and adequate monitoring for adaptive management will contribute to improved outcomes. Application of principles and standards can increase effectiveness of ecological restoration efforts by establishing criteria for technical implementation across different ecosystem types. They also provide a framework that engages stakeholders and respects socio-cultural realities and needs, which can be applied to both mandatory (i.e. required as part of consent conditions) and non-mandatory restoration (i.e. the voluntary repair of damage). These criteria can improve ecological restoration outcomes, whether used to guide agencies, companies, or individuals engaged in planning, implementation, and monitoring; to guide regulators in developing agreements for mandatory restoration and evaluating whether those agreements have been met; or to guide policymakers in designing, supporting, funding, and evaluating restoration projects at any scale. Thus, the use of clear and carefully considered principles and standards underpinning ecological restoration can reduce the risk of unintended damage to ecosystems and native biodiversity, and help to develop high-quality projects and programs amenable to monitoring and assessment. This document expands upon and joins SER's collection of foundation documents including the SER International Primer on Ecological Restoration (SER 2004), Guidelines for Developing and Managing Restoration Projects (Clewell et al. 2005), Ecological Restoration—a Means of Conserving Biodiversity and Sustaining Livelihoods (Gann & Lamb 2006), and Ecological Restoration for Protected Areas: Principles, Guidelines and Best Practices (Keenleyside et al. 2012). It also utilizes SER's Code of Ethics (SER 2013) and specifically draws on material and models in the two editions of National Standards for the Practice of Ecological Restoration in Australia (McDonald et al. 2016a, 2018). Several books were influential including Restoration Ecology: The New Frontier (Van Andel & Aronson 2012), Ecological Restoration: Principles, Values and Structure of an Emerging Profession (Clewell & Aronson 2013), Foundations of Restoration Ecology (Palmer et al. 2016), Routledge Handbook of Ecological and Environmental Restoration (Allison & Murphy 2017), and Management of Ecological Rehabilitation Projects (Liu & Clewell 2017). We have drawn content from the editorial Ecosystem Restoration is Now a Global Priority (Aronson & Alexander 2013), and the policy documents Ecosystem Restoration: Short-term Action Plan of the CBD (Convention on Biological Diversity 2016), Partnering with Nature: The Case for Natural Regeneration in Forest and Landscape Restoration (Chazdon et al. 2017), and Restoring Forests and Landscapes: The Key to a Sustainable Future by the Global Partnership on Forest and Landscape Restoration (GPFLR; Besseau et al. 2018). Works published in SER's journal Restoration Ecology, book series on The Science and Practice of Ecological Restoration (Island Press), and Restoration Resource Center, as well as many other documents have informed development of this edition. While Sections 1 through 3 are mostly free of references for brevity's sake, Section 4 (Leading Practices), Appendix 1, and Supplement S1 include citations. To better address the diverse roles people play in restoration and how the goals of Indigenous groups fit into the overall picture of ecological restoration, we have reorganized the Principles to better incorporate social-economic and cultural factors that can greatly affect outcomes of restoration. Principle 1 expands on social goals and includes a ""Social Benefits Wheel"" tool to help convey social targets and goals of a project. Principles and Key Concepts are merged into a single section on Principles. A compilation of historical documents used to synthesize the Principles is provided in Supplement S1. Scaling-up ecological restoration and the relationship between ecological restoration and allied activities included in Section 4 of the first edition are incorporated into Principles 7 and 8 in this version. Key topics related to reference models and restoration approaches are included in a new section on Leading Practices (Section 4), which also considers integration of ecological restoration into global restoration initiatives. We added a technical appendix on sourcing of seeds and other propagules for restoration. SER defines ecological restoration as the process of assisting the recovery of an ecosystem that has been degraded, damaged, or destroyed. It is distinct from restoration ecology, the science that supports the practice of ecological restoration, and from other forms of environmental repair in seeking to assist recovery of native ecosystems and ecosystem integrity. Ecological restoration aims to move a degraded ecosystem to a trajectory of recovery that allows adaptation to local and global changes, as well as persistence and evolution of its component species. Ecological restoration is commonly used to describe both the process and the outcome sought for an ecosystem, but the Standards reserve the term restoration for the activity undertaken and recovery for the outcome sought or achieved. The Standards define ecological restoration as any activity with the goal of achieving substantial ecosystem recovery relative to an appropriate reference model, regardless of the time required to achieve recovery. Reference models used for ecological restoration projects are informed by native ecosystems, including many traditional cultural ecosystems (see Principle 3). Ecological restoration projects or programs include one or more targets that identify the native ecosystem to be restored (as informed by the reference model), and project goals that establish the level of recovery sought. Full recovery is defined as the state or condition whereby, following restoration, all key ecosystem attributes closely resemble those of the reference model. These attributes include absence of threats, species composition, community structure, physical conditions, ecosystem function, and external exchanges. Where lower levels of recovery are planned or occur due to resource, technical, environmental, or social constraints, recovery is referred to as partial recovery. An ecological restoration project or program should aspire to substantial recovery of the native biota and ecosystem functions (contrast with rehabilitation below). When full recovery is the goal, an important benchmark is when the ecosystem demonstrates self-organization. At this stage, if unexpected barriers or lack of particular species or processes take recovery off course, further restoration actions may be required to ensure that the trajectory ultimately continues toward full recovery. Once fully recovered, any ongoing activities (e.g. to maintain disturbance regimes) would be considered ecosystem maintenance or management. Specific activities, such as prescribed fire or the control of invasive species, may be used in both restoration and maintenance phases of a project. The goal of rehabilitation projects is not native ecosystem recovery, but rather reinstating a level of ecosystem functioning for renewed and ongoing provision of ecosystem services potentially derived from nonnative ecosystems as well. Rehabilitation is one of many restorative activities aligned along a continuum that includes ecological restoration and its allied and complementary activities, all of which contribute to improving ecosystem integrity and social–ecological resilience (see Principle 8). A few assumptions about the role of ecological restoration underpin the Standards. First, restoration of most native ecosystems is a challenging process, and substantial recovery usually requires long periods of time. Consequently, many ecological restoration projects are still far from achieving the levels of biodiversity, ecosystem functioning, and delivery of services of intact ecosystems. Thus, while compensation may be mandated as a result of ecosystem loss or degradation, the potential for ecological restoration should never be invoked as a justification for destroying or damaging existing native ecosystems or for unsustainable use. Similarly, any potential to translocate rare species should not be used to justify destruction of existing intact habitat. Where compensation is mandated, however, the level of compensation should be far in excess of the estimated ecosystem loss or degradation, and care should be exercised to ensure offsets do not cause additional degradation. Second, the Standards clarify the use of a native reference ecosystem as a model for the ecosystem being restored. The reference model, derived from multiple sources of information, aims to characterize the condition of the ecosystem as it would be had it not been degraded, adjusted as necessary to accommodate changed or predicted change in biotic or environmental conditions (e.g. climate change). The Standards also make clear that appropriate reference models for ecological restoration are not based on immobilizing an ecological community at some past point in time, but rather increasing potential for native species and communities to recover and continue to reassemble, adapt, and evolve. Finally, ecological restoration is part of a larger set of ecosystem management practices designed to conserve and, where appropriate, sustainably utilize native ecosystems. These practices range from regenerative agriculture, fisheries, and forestry to ecological engineering, including those invoked in the Convention on Biological Diversity, the United Nations 2030 Sustainable Development Goals, and by Forest Landscape Restoration (FLR) projects and a multitude of local and regional programs. As such, ecological restoration complements other conservation activities and nature-based solutions and vice versa. The following Principles provide a framework to explain, define, guide, and measure the activities and outcomes of ecological restoration practice (Fig. 1). They represent a distillation of principles and concepts presented in SER foundational documents, scientific literature, and practitioner experience (Appendix S1). Ecological restoration is undertaken for many reasons including to recover ecosystem integrity and to satisfy personal, cultural, social-economic, and ecological values. This combination of ecological and social benefits can lead to improved social–ecological resilience. Humans benefit from a closer and reciprocal engagement with nature. Participating in restoration projects can be transformative, for example, when children involved in restoration projects develop personal ownership over restoration sites, or when community volunteers seek new career or vocational paths in restoration practice or science. Communities located within or near degraded ecosystems may gain health and other benefits from restoration that improves the quality of air, land, water, and habitats for native species. Indigenous peoples and local communities (both rural and urban) benefit where restoration reinforces nature-based cultures, practices, and livelihoods (e.g. subsistence fishing, hunting, and gathering). In addition, restoration can provide short-term and long-term employment opportunities for local stakeholders, creating positive ecological and economic feedback loops. Stakeholders can make or break a project. Recognizing the expectations and interests of stakeholders and directly involving them is key to ensuring that both nature and society mutually benefit. Stakeholders can help prioritize distribution of restoration actions across the landscape, set project goals (including desired level of recovery), contribute knowledge about ecological conditions and successional patterns to improve development of reference models, and engage in participatory monitoring. Additionally, stakeholders can provide political and financial support for long-term project sustainability, as well as moderating conflicts or disagreements that may arise.

This argument rests on the premise that native and alien species in general do not differ in their impacts. Although there are numerous cases that suggest alien predators and herbivores can sometimes cause severe declines or even local extinctions of native species, very few studies have compared the impacts of native and alien consumers on native populations. Location World‐wide. Methods We have conducted a meta‐analysis on a global dataset to compare the effects of native and alien predators and herbivores on native populations occupying a broad range of terrestrial and aquatic environments. Results The distribution of positive, negative and neutral effects on native prey abundance differed significantly by consumer origin, with alien consumers associated with more negative and fewer positive effects than expected, opposite the finding for native consumers. The effect size of alien consumers was 2.4 times greater than that of native consumers and did not differ between predators and herbivores. The impact of alien consumers did not differ significantly in aquatic (lakes, rivers, oceans) versus terrestrial (continental, island) habitats. Similarly, there was no significant interaction between consumer origin and location, as consumers had similar effects in insular (freshwater, island) and open (continental, marine) systems – contrary to the notion that alien species impacts are mainly problematic for island biota. Main conclusions We hypothesize that the ecological naïveté of native biota facilitates their enhanced suppression by alien predators and herbivores relative to native enemies. Our results counter the assertion that the biogeographical origin of species has no bearing on their ecological impact.",1,0,0.00095832604,openalex

In the United States, the economic cost of non-indigenous species invasions is estimated to be between US$128 and US$147 billion annually (Pimentel, Zuniga, & Morrison, 2005), but the total cost is likely to be greater if ecosystem damage is also considered (Lovell, Stone, & Fernandez, 2006). Of this, economic losses from the effects of invasive fish in aquatic systems are believed to comprise US$1–5.7 billion annually (Pimentel et al., 2005). In New Zealand, a number of invasive fish species occur and are, in some places, particularly abundant. The acknowledged epicentre and only formally defined containment area for invasive koi carp (an ornamental strain of Cyprinus carpio) in New Zealand is located in the North Island in the Lower Waikato River Basin (LWRB; Grainger, 2015). Eutrophic conditions combined with a temperate climate and connected shallow riverine lakes and wetlands provide ideal conditions for the proliferation of this (Bajer et al., 2015; Vilizzi, Tarkan, & Copp, 2015) and other invasive fish such as the brown bullhead catfish Ameiurus nebulosus and goldfish Carassius auratus. In this paper, we describe an invasive fish management programme where unwanted organisms are removed from the aquatic habitat and converted into beneficial products to address or support environmental issues and initiatives related to conservation and/or restoration. The underlying closed loop philosophy of the programme is also to demonstrate core values of traceability and sustainability in the development, deployment and performance of these products. In particular, we discuss the importance of nutrient transfer between ecosystems, from aquatic organism capture through to uptake in terrestrial and coastal environments to illustrate the integrated framework within two case studies. The first study describes the use of processed invasive fish as a replacement for imported synthetic fertiliser tablets typically used in small-to-medium scale replanting programmes by restoration managers and community groups. For this case, we describe an experiment conducted across a regional dune restoration planting programme. The second is the use of invasive fish material as a lure in trapping programmes to control other introduced pests (e.g. introduced rats and mustelids) which have undesirable impacts on native terrestrial plant and animal taxa in New Zealand. Invasive fish for both these case studies were harvested at our invasive fish “demonstration site” using a fixed semi-automated fish cage (Figure 1). The fish cage is fitted with a customised mesh shape and size to minimise native fish by-catch while retaining the smallest invasive fish possible (David, 2015). Following euthanasia, fish are processed on site in a bacterial digester. Historically marine seabird nesting sites were abundant throughout coastal New Zealand dunes and the marine-derived nutrients that birds brought back to nesting sites were important for fuelling growth of native sand-binding dune plants (Hawke & Newman, 2007). These plant species have undergone substantial population declines, however, due to a range of human-induced stressors (Hawke & Newman, 2007). Nitrogen is now recognised to be the limiting nutrient for plants in these dune systems (Bergin & Kimberley, 1999) and planting programmes aimed at restoring dune plants generally use artificial fertiliser tablets to replace depleted nutrients and improve long-term plant survival and growth. A wide range of fertiliser tablets are available to consumers varying in nutrient and trace element composition, and different tablets are often used interchangeably by community groups in restoration planting programmes. However, tracing the source(s) of components used in artificial fertiliser manufacture, the majority of which are imported from overseas, can be a formidable challenge (Wood & Cowie, 2004). The production and distribution of artificial fertilisers, particularly those containing nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and potassium (K), are energy intensive (Bindraben, Dimpka, Nagarajan, Roy, & Rabbinge, 2015). Atmospheric N is typically synthesised into a useable form via the Haber–Bosch process, and the energy source used to drive the process (typically natural gas or gassified coal) results in emissions which purportedly vary considerably from 3.42 (EU) to 11.06 (China) kg CO2/kg N produced (Fertilisers Europe 2016, http://www.yara.dk/godning/miljo/reducing-carbon-footprint/fertilizer-life-cycle-perspective/life-cycle-analysis-of-ammonium-nitrate/). Phosphate on the other hand is typically mined from finite resources. Both processes generate considerable greenhouse gas emissions and other waste products (Wood & Cowie, 2004). Therefore, understanding the life cycle of components (footprint) used to assemble and produce an artificial tablet (that may subsequently be used in a restoration project) is in our view an important consideration. Recently proposed regulations for fertilisers by the European Commission to encourage use of recycled materials (e.g. biowaste) and to reduce, for example, soil accumulation of cadmium (an element commonly found in artificial fertiliser; Fertiliser Matters 2016) supports this perspective. Our proposed approach is a low footprint, locally produced recycling process where the infeed materials comprise predominantly unwanted organism protein (invasive fish) and other local recycled by-products (e.g. untreated sawdust, Figure 1). In terms of ecosystem energetics, fish provide a valuable nutrient recycling service in freshwater because these fish convert ingested material into biomass as they grow (Andersson, Granéli, & Stenson, 1988; Drenner, Day, Basham, Durward Smith, & Jensen, 1997). For instance, a study by Kitchell, Foonce, and Tennis (1975) calculated that up to 70% of phosphorus in the pelagic zone of Lake Wingra, USA, was embodied in fish biomass and that decomposition of dead post-spawned fish was likely to contribute substantially to the supply of phosphorus in lakes. Although carp also liberate nutrients during defecation and suctorial feeding (Morgan & Hicks, 2013), comparative phosphorus contributions from excretion of live fish are likely to be much lower (Andersson et al., 1988). The ability to remove this nutrient-rich biomass and reuse it elsewhere may be particularly beneficial to systems like the LWRB where substantial nutrient losses from intensive agriculture into water bodies have resulted in water quality declines driven predominantly by increases in total phosphorus and nitrate (Vant, 2008). In this case study, we compared the performance of recycled invasive fish fertiliser against artificial tablets for fuelling two species of dune plants—the New Zealand endemic sand-binding pingao Ficinia spiralis and native spinifex Spinifex sericeus. These species were planted in three coastal New Zealand dune systems to compare growth (plant spread and vigour) in response to nutrient additions at the time of planting (i.e. invasive fish and commercial fertiliser tablets vs. no fertiliser controls). The pelletised invasive fish had a lower nitrogen content than the tablets (Table S4), so to ensure comparability in trials, 72 g of fish pellets was equivalent to a 10 g commercial fertiliser tablet. Three dose rates were tested (1, 2 or 3 tablets, 72, 144 or 216 g pellets, Figure 2). More specific methodological and result details for this case study including experimental design, planting plot layouts and replication can be found in the supplementary information provided (Supplementary information 1, Figures S1 and S2). In summary, in most cases, invasive fish pellets produced a similar boost in plant growth and vigour to that achieved using commercial fertiliser pellets at all three sites and all fertilised plants grew significantly greater with respect to vigour and spread than no fertiliser controls (ANOVA, 0.05, Figures 3 and 4, Tables S1–S3, Figure S3). There was little additional growth at the medium- and high-dose rates for either fertiliser type suggesting that a single dose of either tablets or pellets is sufficient for growth performance while maintaining manageable field deployment logistics (material transport and application, Bergin & Bergin, 2016). Furthermore, stable isotope analysis of the nitrogen in dried dune plant material indicated clear uptake of nutrients into plant tissues from both pellets and tablets. Plants supplied with either fertiliser type (pellets or tablets) exhibited consistent but significantly different δ15N signatures, reflective of the origin and composition of the added nutrient source (Table 1). In effect, locally produced invasive fish pellets appear to be a viable and comparably performing alternative to imported artificial fertiliser tablets for dune restoration planting initiatives. In contrast to artificial tablets, information regarding the origin, composition and life cycle process to manufacture the fish pellets is transparent and traceable for consumers. We have also demonstrated that it is possible to regionally reposition nutrients embodied in invasive fish obtained from an ecosystem in which they are in excess and undesirable, into one in which they are presently depleted but were historically more naturally abundant. Flora and fauna in New Zealand exhibit high levels of endemism and organisms evolved in an environment that was historically free of terrestrial mammalian predators (Bull & Whitaker, 1975). Following relatively recent human occupation and the coincident introduction of numerous mammalian pests, catastrophic and widespread declines in biodiversity occurred (Atkinson, 1989), and continue today. Unsurprisingly, a wide range of governmental and community-based mammalian pest control and eradication programmes are in place throughout New Zealand and play an important role in biodiversity conservation (Ewen, Adams, & Renwick, 2013). Protein-based baits are typically used as lures for terrestrial pest control programmes. In particular, introduced mustelids (stoat Mustela erminea, weasel Mustela nivalis, ferret Mustela furo), feral cat Felis catus, rat species (Norway rat Rattus norvegicus, ship rat R. rattus), house mouse Mus musculus and European hedgehog Erinaceus europaeus are the primary targets for protein lures. Currently, the most effective lure is considered to be a commercially available rabbit-based product (“Erayz,” Connovations, NZ, C. Gillies, pers. comm.) that is typically deployed by conservation groups in kill traps. Chicken eggs are often used in tandem with rabbit jerky as an additional visual lure for mustelids. In this case study, a new line of 50 kill traps (DOC 250's, Curtis Metal Products, NZ—double-ended spring-loaded, http://www.predatortraps.com/) were established around the perimeter of the National Wetlands Centre, North Island, New Zealand. A combination of egg and rabbit or invasive fish pellet baits was placed in alternating kill traps by a local conservation community group with bait type (rabbit/egg or fish) in the first trap determined randomly. Traps were checked approximately monthly by volunteers (Figure 5) and results of any kills documented and reported. Preliminary results after 9 months of trapping suggest that invasive fish baits are attractive to some terrestrial pests, in particular hedgehogs and rats (Table 2). Currently, traps with fish bait have a greater number of confirmed kills for hedgehogs (Friedman rank sum test, p = .014), and a comparable number for rats (p = .479), compared to traps with rabbit/egg baits. Thus far, only stoats (p = .025) and mice (p = .045) have been preferentially lured by traps with rabbit/egg baits. Based on these results, invasive fish baits appear to be a durable, promising and complementary lure for controlling rats and hedgehogs in particular. Further ongoing testing is expected to provide more robust conclusions on the long-term effectiveness of fish-based bait for this purpose. Internationally many examples exist where invasive animals are commercially harvested from non-native habitats and various components reused. In most cases, the end products tend to support other human needs and wants with the majority of invasive product outputs related either directly or indirectly to food consumption (e.g. Nuñez, Kuebbing, Dimarco, & Simberloff, 2012) and or clothing production (e.g. http://thefishleather.co/). For example, there are cookbooks dedicated to the consumption of invasive species (e.g. Franke, 2007). As exemplified in the two trial case studies presented, the general philosophy of the “CarpN-neutral project” has been to use invasive species products for addressing other conservation problems rather than more typically creating products that directly benefit human consumption or use. Whether used as an alternative fertiliser or as a complementary lure in terrestrial pest control, the material has a low footprint and the products are likely to be organically certifiable. In New Zealand, organic certification can be obtained from two primary service providers: BioGrow NZ and AssureQuality. Each have minimum requirements to meet the standard for “compost” which predominantly relates to heavy metal concentrations and the presence of pesticides in the final invasive fish pellet product, both which have been extensively tested for with results suggesting that requirements could be met (Tables S5 and S6). An operational model whereby the running costs of this regional programme (currently paid for by regional ratepayers) could be recovered is possible with an increase in scale of our existing demonstration site (Figure 1). At present, managers and community groups pay an average of NZD 15 cents/artificial imported fertiliser tablet. Thus, to fertilise c. 350 dune plants with artificial fertilisers would cost around NZD $50 (c. 3.5 kg tablets)—for invasive fish pellets, NZD $50 equates to a 25 kg bag to deliver the same dose of nutrients to the same number of plants. The actual cost to produce 1 tonne (including pelletising and bagging but excluding harvest labour) is c. NZD $400. For pest lures or baits, rabbit jerky currently costs NZD 45c/piece/trap while the fish lure costs NZD 14c/trap (c. 70 g pellets/trap). However, it is acknowledged that commercialisation of such organisms can result in incentivising or facilitating further spread (Nuñez et al., 2012) which could result in a potential net environmental loss rather than gain (e.g. Barbier & Knowler, 2006). Consequently, our proposed regional government concept adopts a non-profit philosophy to remain cost neutral in this regard to discourage potential for profiteering through invasive species spread. A common argument regarding security of supply in such cases concerns the sustainability of the programme if harvest volumes decline due to intensive harvest pressure. Evidence from elsewhere in the Southern Hemisphere where invasive fish harvest has been commercialised suggests that, while temporary reductions in catch may occur within a given waterbody subject to intensive harvest, the wider population recovers rapidly once harvest pressure is reduced with little evidence of reductions in either distribution or biomass being sustained by harvest at larger scales (Koehn, Brumley, & Gehrke, 2000). Information relating to harvest impact is valuable for river managers as it clearly indicates that harvest pressure can reduce local biomass, and therefore, conservation priority catchments can be targeted for ongoing harvest pressure to achieve localised conservation outcomes (assuming other contributing anthropogenic pressures are also addressed). Meanwhile, a wider strategy which allows for a centralised processing facility and safe disposal point for harvest occurring in other areas, or by other entities (e.g. commercial operators, recreational anglers) could ensure security of supply of material. For instance during 2016, the CarpN Neutral programme provided a fish disposal service for the New Zealand Bowhunters Society at the annual “Koi Carp Classic” (http://www.nzbowhunters.nz/events/koi-carp-classic/) where c. 5 tonnes of invasive fish were harvested from the river by members during the event. These fish were then processed into pellets and later used in regional dune restoration planting. Although the scale of our dune planting trials was relatively small (2,400 plants in total), annual nursery propagation of sand-binding dune plants in New Zealand is estimated to be around 250,000 plants. If each of these plants was provided with 72 g fish pellets, c. 18 tonnes of invasive fish fertiliser (equivalent to c. 40 tonnes of processed wet weight fish) could be repositioned into dunes annually potentially replacing c. 2.5 tonnes of artificial fertiliser tablets. An important consideration of our concept is traceability and sustainability through various parts of the programme including: minimising by-catch of native fish species (David, 2015), using an energy efficient method to process invasive fish onsite (thermophilic bacteria), minimising carbon use in both production and distribution by using the material locally (Figures 1 and 6) and incorporating carbon into the product in the form of sawdust. As part of the dune planting experiment, we undertook chemical analyses of two other commercial fertiliser tablets commonly used in New Zealand. We noted that there was high variability in different trace and heavy metal elements between these two tablets (Tables S4 and S5). Although quality manufacturing standards for commercial artificial fertiliser production exist, disclosing all components within them (e.g. compounds for binding) appears to be voluntary. Taking our concept one step further, we are currently trialling the incorporation of biochar, a by-product of pyrolysis from corn production, into digested invasive fish. Biochar has been shown to increase nitrogen retention and lower greenhouse gas emissions when added to animal compost (Agyarco-Mintah et al., 2016). With respect to the use of biochar in fish pellets, the objective is to test its performance as a slow release fertiliser and also as a means of long-term carbon replacement and storage in sand and soil. Significant potential to further develop raw invasive fish flesh and liquid for use in other conservation projects also exists. For instance, foliar application of digested invasive fish “juice” as a potential liquid fertiliser and anti-lagomorph (e.g. rabbit) browse/repellent in native planting programmes is currently underway. New dune plantings can be heavily browsed by introduced herbivores during early growth. It is proposed that the oily content and strong “sulphurous” smell of this liquid may possess useful compounds as suggested by Trent, Nolte, and Wagner (2001), to reduce herbivorous browsing during early plant growth. At present, a U.S. produced bovine blood-based product is commonly applied in New Zealand for this purpose; http://www.plantskydd.com/rabbit-repellent.html.Other alternatives such as installing plant guards and fences to deter browsing in dunes are logistically challenging and costly to implement. Irrespective of the application, we posit that the simple approach of turning such outputs back into restoration programmes (and using products from one invasive animal to control another) creates potential to reduce overall costs for biodiversity enhancement and biosecurity while simultaneously dealing with unwanted organisms in areas where they are problematic. This project demonstrates a practical method of processing pest fish for use in restoration of other degraded ecosystems or put simply it is about “turning something bad into something good.” We consider this concept to be an alternative approach to restoration whereby an aquatic biosecurity problem is specifically being used to improve indigenous biodiversity outcomes across a range of other ecosystem types. We propose that this project is a useful vehicle to demonstrate genuine sustainability and promote awareness of the origin and fate of nutrients within and between ecosystems. It also illustrates alternate ways in which invasive products can be applied to these systems for positive environmental outcomes. A similar philosophy should be applicable to problematic and abundant invasive species elsewhere, particularly where those organisms are susceptible to either point source control or efficient mass harvest.

 Resolving the tree of life is among the greatest challenges for modern biology, yet genetic data for many species are lacking to infer their position in the tree with confidence. In fact, little is known about what the missing species are and where to look for them. I identify main hotspots that host the most unsampled vertebrate species and test the hypothesis that local diversity determines the degree of sampling effort.
 
 Location
 Global.
 
 Taxon
 Terrestrial vertebrates (amphibians, birds, mammals, reptiles).
 
 Methods
 I use published distributional data and search DNA sequence repositories to identify taxa with no genetic data available. I map spatial patterns of the unsampled diversity and sampling effort to test the effect of species richness on sampling completeness. I examine the dependence of country-level sampling completeness on the country's socio-economic development.
 
 Results
 About 24% of living terrestrial vertebrate species have no genetic data available. The Andes, Central Africa and the Malay Archipelago are the most unsampled. Sampling effort is highest in North America, continental South-East Asia and Amazonia. In contrast, Central Africa, the Horn of Africa, Malay Archipelago and Andes are consistently the least sampled regions. Regions of low diversity are better sampled than biodiversity hotspots.
 
 Main conclusions
 The most unsampled species are in the tropics. I pinpoint several key regions that are least represented in the tree of life and where sampling should be prioritized. Country's wealth seems to be an informative proxy for its sampling completeness.",1,0,0.008435622,openalex

While such approaches have been applied to large terrestrial and aquatic vertebrate species, their application to other traded organisms has not been extensively explored. Here, we examined the utility of these techniques for identifying source populations of aquarium ornamental invertebrates, using members of the Hawaiian atyid genus Halocaridina as a study system. These shrimps, restricted to anchialine habitats of the Hawaiian Islands, are popular in the aquarium trade due to their ability to survive in hermetically sealed containers for extended periods of time. However, commercial harvesting, coupled with habitat destruction and strong regional endemism, could lead to the depletion/extinction of unique populations. Because the land district of Kona, along the west coast of the island of Hawai'i, has the state's highest concentration of anchialine habitats, we hypothesized that commercially available Halocaridina originated from this region. To test this, mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I gene sequences from 96 individuals, obtained from six vendors, were compared with 580 homologous sequences from previous studies covering the known distribution range of Halocaridina. Recovery of identical, regional-specific haplotypes, network analyses and statistical assignment tests identified these commercially acquired specimens as belonging to either the Kona, Ka'ū, (western and southern coasts, respectively, island of Hawai'i) or Kina'u (southern coast, island of Maui) genetic groups of these shrimps. Although 39 of the 96 individuals originated from the Kona genetic group as hypothesized, our finding that commercially available Halocaridina are from three genetic groups spanning two islands suggests that other populations also warrant potential management consideration. While this study represents the first application of molecular genetics in identifying source populations of aquarium ornamental species, we feel that these techniques are amenable more broadly as they are dependent on only a few caveats.",1,0,0.19375886,openalex

 2.
 We sampled fish assemblages and conducted supralittoral vegetation surveys at 27 beaches on the west coast of Vancouver Island, British Columbia. Thirteen of the beaches had supralittoral vegetation characteristic of old-growth coastal forests and 14 had been previously subjected to logging or other disturbances.
 
 3.
 Physical features (e.g. substrate, salinity, etc.) were recorded at each beach to determine whether there were significant associations between supralittoral vegetation and beach characteristics as well as between beach characteristics and fish assemblages.
 
 4.
 Across all 27 beaches, 1832 individuals of 31 species of nearshore fish were collected, primarily juvenile cottids and salmonids. Mean species richness did not differ between beaches with old-growth versus secondary-growth supralittoral vegetation; however, a higher cumulative number of species was found at beaches with old-growth supralittoral vegetation.
 
 5.
 Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA) showed that beach characteristics and supralittoral vegetation were not significantly associated. Separate CCA for fish associations with beach characteristics and fish associations with supralittoral vegetation explained ∼55% of the variance in fish assemblage composition, suggesting that fish assemblage composition is significantly affected by substrate, submerged vegetation, and physico-chemical conditions as well as by the community composition of vegetation in adjacent supralittoral habitats.
 
 6.
 Specifically, we found associations between supralittoral vegetation and penpoint gunnels (Apodichthys flavidus Girard), tidepool sculpins (Oligocottus maculosus Girard), Pacific staghorn sculpins (Leptocottus armatus Girard), arrow gobies (Clevelandia ios Jordan and Gilbert), shiner perch (Cymatogaster aggregata Gibbons) and kelp perch (Brachyistius frenatus Gill). Juvenile chum (Oncorhynchus keta Walbaum) and coho (Oncorhynchus kisutch Walbaum) salmon were strongly associated with supralittoral vegetation characteristic of mature coastal forests such as mosses and western red cedar (Thuja plicata) suggesting that some nearshore fish species may be affected by processes originating in terrestrial ecosystems.

Native forests on oceanic islands are important refugia for endemic species, many of which are rare and highly threatened. Long-term monitoring schemes for those biota and ecosystems are urgently needed: (i) to provide quantitative baselines for detecting changes within island ecosystems, (ii) to evaluate the effectiveness of conservation and management actions, and (iii) to identify general ecological patterns and processes using multiple island systems as repeated ‘natural experiments’. In this contribution, we call for a Global Island Monitoring Scheme (GIMS) for monitoring the remaining native island forests, using bryophytes, vascular plants, selected groups of arthropods and vertebrates as model taxa. As a basis for the GIMS, we also present new, optimized monitoring protocols for bryophytes and arthropods that were developed based on former standardized inventory protocols. Effective inventorying and monitoring of native island forests will require: (i) permanent plots covering diverse ecological gradients (e.g. elevation, age of terrain, anthropogenic disturbance); (ii) a multiple-taxa approach that is based on standardized and replicable protocols; (iii) a common set of indicator taxa and community properties that are indicative of native island forests’ welfare, building on, and harmonized with existing sampling and monitoring efforts; (iv) capacity building and training of local researchers, collaboration and continuous dialogue with local stakeholders; and (v) long-term commitment by funding agencies to maintain a global network of native island forest monitoring plots. © 2018, The Author(s).",1,0,0.4141899,positives

The lagoon is surrounded by the largest mangrove stand in Java and is under constant anthropogenic pressure, mainly due to logging, land conversion for agriculture, overfishing and industrial pollution. This study aims to determine the crab community composition at different sites of the lagoon in relation to vegetation composition and sediment parameters. In addition it investigates if mangrove crabs can be used as bioindicators to describe the environmental state of mangrove forests (tree diversity, degree of logging). It was assumed to find a low crab diversity and species richness and a strong dominance of a single species at highly disturbed forest sites compared to moderately disturbed sites. A stratified, hierarchical design was used to sample the crab fauna at 13 stations distributed over the entire lagoon. Additionally, abiotic parameters and vegetation composition were recorded. In total 6463 crabs were caught belonging to 49 species, 5 superfamilies and 10 families, with Ocypodidae and Sesarmidae being the families of most note. Mean density of adult crabs was 27.7 individuals*m -2 and mean biomass was 12.8 g wet mass*m -2 or 1.3 g ash free dry mass*m -2. Density and biomass varied strongly within and between stations but they where within the range reported for other mangrove forests of the Indo-West-Pacific. Species composition was significantly different between stations. The distribution of facultatively leaf-feeding grapsid crabs was related to vegetation parameters (tree, seedling and undergrowth density), but the occurrence of single crab and tree species was not correlated. The distribution of ocypodid crabs, feeding on detritus and microphytobenthos, correlated with sediment characteristics like median grain size and organic content. The crab community was strongly dominated by one species at six stations, however, this was not correlated to the degree of logging. Leaf-feeding crab and mangrove tree diversity was correlated at areas of one hectare (stations), but not at a lower spatial scale (areas of 100 m 2, "" zone"" ). Species richness of leaf-feeding crabs was not linked to forest diversity. Hence a functional relation between leaf-feeding crab and tree species diversity could not be proven. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.",1,0,0.0019041217,positives

We compiled 1808 time series from 71 threatened and near‐threatened terrestrial and volant mammal species and subspecies in Australia (48% of all threatened mammal taxa) to compare relative trends of populations subject to different management strategies. We adapted the Living Planet Index to develop the Threatened Species Index for Australian Mammals and track aggregate trends for all sampled threatened mammal populations and for small (&lt;35 g), medium (35–5500 g), and large mammals (&gt;5500 g) from 2000 to 2017. Unmanaged populations (42 taxa) declined by 63% on average; unmanaged small mammals exhibited the greatest declines (96%). Populations of 17 taxa in havens (islands and fenced areas that excluded or eliminated introduced red foxes [ Vulpes vulpes ] and domestic cats [ Felis catus ]) increased by 680%. Outside havens, populations undergoing sustained predator baiting initially declined by 75% but subsequently increased to 47% of their abundance in 2000. At sites where predators were not excluded or baited but other actions (e.g., fire management, introduced herbivore control) occurred, populations of small and medium mammals declined faster, but large mammals declined more slowly, than unmanaged populations. Only 13% of taxa had data for both unmanaged and managed populations; index comparisons for this subset showed that taxa with populations increasing inside havens declined outside havens but taxa with populations subject to predator baiting outside havens declined more slowly than populations with no management and then increased, whereas unmanaged populations continued to decline. More comprehensive and improved monitoring (particularly encompassing poorly represented management actions and taxonomic groups like bats and small mammals) is required to understand whether and where management has worked. Improved implementation of management for threats other than predation is critical to recover Australia's threatened mammals.",1,0,0.020279918,openalex

Island is a special terrestrial ecosystem, on which the communities and environmental conditions are similar to that of the mainland, but its ecological structure is relatively simple, and the species richness is lower than that of the mainland. Island ecosystems still has strong ability of carbon storage, carbon fixation and plays an important role in the global carbon cycle. This work discusses carbon sequestration estimates in the island terrestrial ecosystems. Island regions are especially vulnerable to projected changes in eustatic sea level, storm impacts, and habitat suitability due to low-lying land and limited migration potential. The island area in the global is about 1/15 of the whole mainland, so the ecosystem of forest, shrub, and grass on islands has had an impact on the global carbon sequestration. Although the species of forest, shrub, and grass on islands is relative fewer, there is significant difference of biodiversity on the islands at different latitudes. The combining methodology of the estimate model of biomass and the inventory of sampling investigation can be selected to estimate the carbon storage of forests, shrub, and grass on islands. The estimate model of biomass is a specific type of modeling that seeks to mechanistically represent cycles of carbon at islands regional ecosystem through an integrated into account of biology and geochemistry. Using models to estimate carbon sequestration on the island, factors influencing the carbon storage assessment are considered to be identified. The factors covers the land area of the island, season, wind, slope, aspect, elevation, average temperature, rainfall, soil properties, and so on. Biodiversity also enhances the ability of ecosystems to maintain multiple functions, such as carbon storage, productivity, and the buildup of nutrient pools. If the maintenance of biodiversity is to be justified as a strategy for enhancing ecosystem services, it is essential to understand how biodiversity affects ecosystem multifunctionality. Nevertheless, the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem multifunctionality, especially carbon storage, has seldom been studied in islands. It is focused on how the richness of perennial vascular plants (hereafter ""species richness"") and a range of key abiotic factors (climate, slope, elevation, and soil texture) influence carbon storage in different typical islands ecosystems. The direct relationship between species richness and carbon storage on island can be evaluated using both ordinary least-squares (OLS) and spatial regression models. And these results will suggest that the correlation between species richness and carbon cycle may be a general pattern in nature that reflects a cause-and-effect linkage. Furthermore, a large proportion of photosynthetical fixed carbon is directed belowground to roots and associated microorganisms, potentially affecting carbon sequestration either positively or negatively. A better mechanistic understanding of how the belowground allocation of carbon affects long-term sequestration rates is crucial for predictions of how the currently large carbon stock in island soils may respond to altered climate change, elevated CO2 levels, and other environmental shifts. Fungi play important roles in island soil ecosystems, as the decomposers of organic matter and the root-associated mediators of belowground carbon transport and respiration. It will be profiled the relative abundance of major functional groups of fungi through the depth profile of island soil by use of modern gene technology. And the results will elucidate the mechanisms underpinning carbon sequestration in island soil and highlight the importance of root-associated fungi for ecosystem carbon balance.",1,0,0.16601364,positives

Indonesia is currently the country with the highest deforestation rates worldwide with potentially devastating effects on its diverse and highly endemic flora and fauna. Here we present a comprehensive assessment of the varied effects of forest conversion and land-use intensification on vascular plant diversity across the four dominant land-use systems in the lowlands of Sumatra: rainforest, jungle rubber agroforest, rubber plantations, and oil palm plantations. We conducted plot-based species inventories in Jambi Province and assessed a total of 156,006 individuals and 1382 plant species. Forest had the highest levels of alpha, beta, and gamma diversity, followed by jungle rubber. Plant communities in oil palm plantations were characterized by a high density of herbaceous weeds, but low species numbers and low beta diversity. Species numbers were comparable in oil palm and rubber plantations, but the latter showed slightly higher beta diversity. Forest had a clearly distinct floristic composition while the floristic composition of the other systems - and especially the two plantation systems - converged. Alien species were almost completely absent from forest, but the number and relative abundance of alien species increased with increasing land-use intensity and was highest in oil palm plantations where 25% of the species and 62% of the individuals belonged to alien species. Our results represent a first quantitative baseline for how forest conversion in Southeast Asia causes loss in species richness, changes in floristic composition and vegetation structure, as well as a shift from native to alien-dominated plant communities. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",1,0,0.33466172,positives

Phylogenetic analysis based on 55 adult morphological characters affirms that this endemic hydrophilid fauna is a monophyletic clade that incorporates the first well-supported transformation from an aquatic to terrestrial way of life within any lineage of the subfamily Hydrophilinae. The clade is prescribed to the genus Limnoxenus Motschulsky, where described members were previously placed. Five new species are described: L. waialeale sp.n. (Kauai), L. kauaiensis sp.n. (Kauai), L. oahuensis sp.n. (Oahu), L. punctatostriatus sp.n. (Kauai) and L. namolokama sp.n. (Kauai). Lectotypes are designated for the two previously described species L. semicylindricus (Eschscholtz) and L. nesiticus (Sharp). The Hawaiian lineage is a component of a larger clade that also includes the remaining four species of Limnoxenus from Europe, South Africa, and Australia, plus the monotypic genera Limnocyclus Balfour-Browne of New Caledonia and Hydramara Knisch of South America. The majority of the Hawaiian species exhibit vestigial wings, an extremely unusual condition in aquatic beetles. No other island-endemic members of the Hydrophilinae are known to be flightless, suggesting insularity per se is not responsible for this condition.

We explored the spatial overlaps between carbon stocks, biodiversity, projected deforestation threats, and the location of REDD+ projects in Indonesia, a tropical country at the forefront of REDD+ development. For biodiversity, we assembled data on the distribution of terrestrial vertebrates (ranges of amphibians, mammals, birds, reptiles) and plants (species distribution models for 8 families). We then investigated congruence between different measures of biodiversity richness and carbon stocks at the national and subnational scales. Finally, we mapped active REDD+ projects and investigated the carbon density and potential biodiversity richness and modeled deforestation pressures within these forests relative to protected areas and unprotected forests. There was little internal overlap among the different hotspots (richest 10% of cells) of species richness. There was also no consistent spatial congruence between carbon stocks and the biodiversity measures: a weak negative correlation at the national scale masked highly variable and nonlinear relationships island by island. Current REDD+ projects were preferentially located in areas with higher total species richness and threatened species richness but lower carbon densities than protected areas and unprotected forests. Although a quarter of the total area of these REDD+ projects is under relatively high deforestation pressure, the majority of the REDD+ area is not. In Indonesia at least, first-generation REDD+ projects are located where they are likely to deliver biodiversity benefits. However, if REDD+ is to deliver additional gains for climate and biodiversity, projects will need to focus on forests with the highest threat to deforestation, which will have cost implications for future REDD+ implementation. Los Patrones Espaciales del Carbono, la Biodiversidad, la Amenaza de Deforestación y los Proyectos REDD+ en Indonesia Actualmente hay preocupación por que las Emisiones Reducidas de la Deforestación y Degradación del Bosque (REDD+, en inglés) puedan fallar en la entrega de co–beneficios potenciales de la biodiversidad si se enfocan en áreas de alto carbono. Exploramos los traslapes espaciales entre los stocks de carbono, la biodiversidad, las amenazas proyectadas de deforestación y la ubicación de proyectos REDD+ en Indonesia, un país tropical a la vanguardia del desarrollo REDD+. Para la biodiversidad, reunimos datos sobre la distribución de vertebrados terrestres (hábitats de anfibios, mamíferos, aves y reptiles) y plantas (modelos de distribución de especies para ocho familia). Después investigamos la congruencia entre las diferentes medidas de la riqueza de la biodiversidad y los stocks de carbono en la escala nacional y sub–nacional. Finalmente mapeamos proyectos REDD+ activos e investigamos la densidad de carbono y la riqueza potencial de la biodiversidad y modelamos presiones de deforestación dentro de estos bosques en relación con áreas protegidas y no protegidas. Hubo poco traslape interno entre los diferentes hotspots (el 10% más rico de las celdas) de riqueza de especies. Tampoco hubo congruencia espacial consecuente entre los stocks de carbono y las medidas de la biodiversidad: una correlación negativa débil en la escala nacional enmascaró las relaciones altamente variables y no-lineales isla por isla. Los proyectos REDD+ actuales estuvieron ubicados preferencialmente en áreas con una riqueza total de especies y con una riqueza de especies amenazadas más altas pero con densidades de carbono más bajas que en las áreas protegidas y los bosques sin protección. Aunque un cuarto del área total de estos proyectos REDD+ está bajo una presión de deforestación relativamente alta, la mayoría del área REDD+ no lo está. Por lo menos en Indonesia, los proyectos REDD+ de primera generación están ubicados en donde tengan probabilidad de entregar beneficios para la biodiversidad. Sin embargo, si se espera que REDD+ entregue beneficios adicionales para el clima y la biodiversidad, los proyectos necesitarán enfocarse en los bosques con la mayor amenaza de deforestación, lo que tendrá implicaciones de costo para la implementación futura de REDD+. There has been a lot of interest in the potential of forest carbon sequestration projects such as those being discussed under the climate mechanism to Reduce Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation (REDD+) to deliver benefits for biodiversity. Under the proposed mechanism, REDD+ payments are intended to protect threatened tropical forests by providing economic incentives for continued forest integrity (Venter & Koh 2011). The plus in REDD+ expands the scope to include the conservation, sustainable management, and enhancement of forest carbon stocks as means to reduce emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (UNFCCC 2008). Some argue that REDD+ offers ""unprecedented"" opportunities for biodiversity (Gardner et al. 2012) and provides new funding for conservation (Venter et al. 2009), rehabilitation of critical habitat (Alexander et al. 2011), and the establishment of new protected areas (PAs) (Macdonald et al. 2011). However, many have also drawn attention to potential risks for biodiversity that are associated with preferential targeting of REDD+ projects in high carbon areas, such as displacement of land use pressure (leakage) into high biodiversity but low carbon areas (Harrison & Paoli 2012) and the diversion of funds for forest conservation away from high biodiversity low carbon areas (Phelps et al. 2012). The degree to which carbon and biodiversity services are colocated in the landscape will influence the potential for delivery of biodiversity benefit; more opportunities are expected where there is congruence between high carbon and biodiversity stocks (Strassburg et al. 2010). There are strong synergies between carbon and biodiversity at the global level (Strassburg et al. 2010). National scale analyses, particularly important for planning REDD+ as an intergovernmental mechanism (Gardner et al. 2012), have been variable in quality and provide ambiguous results. National-level analyses (Madagascar and Bolivia) with finer scale biodiversity data show little congruence between the two or between carbon and biodiversity (Wendland et al. 2010; Sangermano et al. 2012). However, the additional gains from REDD+ for carbon, biodiversity, and other ecosystem services depend on spatially specific threats of deforestation and forest degradation (Busch & Grantham 2013), few, if any, analyses have included both spatial congruence and deforestation threat. Indonesia is the third largest tropical forest country, a major contributor to global greenhouse gas emissions from deforestation, forest and peat degradation (Margono et al. 2014), and a mega-biodiversity country (Sodhi et al. 2004). Indonesia has made commitments to reduce emissions (GOI 2012) and received significant donor funding for REDD+ implementation (Brockhaus et al. 2012). We assessed the distribution of biodiversity in Indonesia, using species ranges of terrestrial vertebrates (mammals, birds, reptiles, and amphibians) and species distribution models (SDMs) covering 8 plant families which are available for Sundaland only. We explored the congruence between carbon and biodiversity based on 3 measures of richness. We then assessed the location of REDD+ projects relative to deforestation threats and spatially determined potential for these to deliver positive outcomes for carbon and biodiversity. Our biodiversity analyses were based on recently updated global species range data for the distribution of mammals, reptiles, and amphibians (IUCN 2012), birds (BirdLife International and NatureServe 2012), and SDMs for 8 major plant families (Dipterocarpaceae, Ericaceae, Fagaceae, Lauraceae, Moraceae, Myristicaceae, Sapindaceae, and Leguminosae) in Sundaland. Details on the biodiversity data sets we used are in Supporting Information. We used newly available high-resolution carbon data sets for above ground biomass (AGB) (Baccini et al. 2012) and soil organic carbon (SOC) up to 100 cm depth (Hiederer & Köchy 2012). A database of active REDD+ projects in Indonesia was developed for the purpose of this research. We contacted all known REDD+ project developers in Indonesia via email to identify active projects, their central coordinates, and the project size. We achieved a 72% response rate and filled in gaps with best guesses based on available gray literature and Web-based reports. We mapped the location of individual projects based on known project boundaries (n = 22), district boundaries for district level projects (n = 3), and circular boundaries for projects for which we did not have exact boundary information (n = 11). For the circular boundaries, we drew a circle around the project centroid on the diameter of which was based on information about project area provided by project developers. See Supporting Information for details on the REDD+ database. The PA data set for Indonesia was obtained from the newly updated World Database on PAs (IUCN & UNEP-WCMC 2013). We included PAs in categories I–VI and nationally recognized PAs without an IUCN category (280 in total). We used the econometric model OSIRIS-Indonesia developed by Busch et al. (2010) to predict deforestation in the absence of REDD+ carbon incentives. The model predicts deforestation based on estimated potential gross agricultural revenues and the cost of converting land from forest to agriculture. Data sets were analyzed at 5 km × 5 km resolution in the WGS 1984 World Mercator projection. We clipped global data sets to the Indonesian Archipelago (total terrestrial land areas), which covers 79,555 terrestrial cells. (Supporting Information for additional information on the spatial analysis methods.) Species distribution analyses were based on the polygon vector ranges of 367 amphibian, 281 reptile, 665 mammal, 1559 bird species, and SDMs of 1720 plant species. Following Wang et al. (2013), we calculated species richness as the number of species range polygons that intersect each grid cell. We used 3 measures of species richness: total species, threatened species, and restricted range species. Threatened species were those classified by the IUCN (2012) as critically endangered, endangered, and vulnerable. Restricted range species were species with a global range in the lowest quartile of their range class (Orme et al. 2005; Grenyer et al. 2006). Species richness of threatened and restricted range species was analyzed only for vertebrates. We identified the richest grid cells (hereafter hotspots [Orme et al. 2005]) for each richness measure for vertebrates and plants (total richness for Sundaland only). We explored the degree to which hotspots overlapped when defined as the richest 10% of cells and the effects of using different hotspot definitions (richest 5%, 10%, 15%, and 25%). We found that regardless of the definition used, there was no overlap between hotspots identified based on different measures of species richness. (Details in Supporting Information.) Indonesian islands differ in size, isolation, topography, climate, and geology, which results in very different island mean biodiversity and carbon values. We therefore investigated congruence at 3 levels—national and within the 5 major islands (Sumatra, Borneo, Papua, Sulawesi, and Java)—to investigate if national scale patterns are consistent within islands. We selected AGB and SOC up to 100 cm depth based on findings that when congruence was evaluated at 3 soil depths (0, 30, and 100 cm), SOC depth had a clear effect on the congruence patterns, particularly in areas identified as carbon-rich peat swamp forests (see Supporting Information). Congruence between carbon and the 3 measures of biodiversity richness were assessed using Spearman's rank correlation coefficient; the effective degrees of freedom were corrected by the level of spatial autocorrelation in the data following Dutilleul (1993). We used hexagonal binning (an esthetic mapping technique that shows differences between data-rich and data-sparse parts of the distribution) to visualize the relationship between carbon and biodiversity and fitted a generalized additive model with 95% CIs. All statistical analyses were carried out in R statistical software (R Core Team 2014). Congruence maps were developed in ArcGis 10.1 with the RGB composite band tool. We assessed the distance and overlap between REDD+ projects (centroid) and PAs (polygon) with the near function in ArcGIS 10.1. We explored the distribution of carbon and biodiversity in Indonesia for 3 categories of forested areas: REDD+ project areas, PAs, and other unprotected forest (outside REDD+ projects and PAs). We defined forest as those pixels comprising mangrove, peat swamp forest, lowland forest, lower montane forest, upper montane forest, and plantation or regrowth as in Miettinen et al. (2012). We sampled 1000 random points from all 3 forest categories and compared the means of the 3 groups with analysis of variance followed by a post hoc Tukey's honestly significant difference test to determine categories that were significantly different. The modeled deforestation data from OSIRIS-Indonesia version 1.5 showing predicted deforestation in the absence of a REDD+ mechanism (Busch et al. 2010) was exported into ArcGIS 10.1 and resampled to 25 km2 grid cells (from 9 km2). We calculated predicted deforestation per hectare for all grid cells classed as forest in 2010. We extracted predicted deforestation values (percent) for each forested cell and reclassified these into 5 deforestation threat classes (very low to very high) based on natural breaks. Using the zonal statistic function in ArcGIS, we calculated the proportion of REDD+ project area, PAs, and unprotected forests that fell into each deforestation class. Our analyses relied on available data sets, such as vertebrate vector range maps, which tend to overestimate the likelihood of species occurrence. Some species will be absent in fragments, logged forests, and recently deforested areas. We dealt with this by refining the species range maps and confining our analyses to remaining forest area-based on 2012 forest cover map, as suggested by Jenkins et al. (2013). We also assumed that most species persist in logged or secondary forests based on the large body of literature which supports this (e.g., Sitompul et al. 2013; Struebig et al. 2013; Edwards et al. 2014). Our projected deforestation threat was based on econometric modeling. The results are therefore a scenario-specific prediction of where threats are most likely to occur given the defined model assumptions. The model predicts deforestation based on the conversion of forest land to agriculture. Patterns of potential species richness were highly variable from taxon to taxon and depended strongly on the richness measure used. For total species richness, the highest potential vertebrate species richness was in Sumatra; lower potential species richness was to the East of Wallace's Line in Sulawesi and Papua (Fig. 1a). When both plant and vertebrate data were combined (possible for Sundaland only), the highest total richness shifted from lowland Sumatra to lowland Kalimantan (Fig. 1d), and the northern tip of Kalimantan had the highest total potential species richness (>1270 species in a single cell). Threatened vertebrate species richness was distributed differently. The highest potential richness was concentrated in coastal lowlands of Sumatra and submontane regions of Kalimantan (Fig. 1b), whereas Papua had the lowest potential threatened species richness. Potential restricted range species richness was mostly concentrated in the uplands (Java, Sulawesi, and Papua) and the smaller islands of Buru, Seram, and Halmahera in the Wallacea ecoregion (Fig. 1c). Richness patterns for individual taxa and measures of biodiversity are in Supporting Information. Hotspots of biodiversity richness identified based on different measures did not generally overlap, further emphasizing that the identification of areas important for biodiversity depended on the measure used (Fig. 1). For example, when hotspots were defined as the richest 10% of cells, no cells were identified as hotspots for all 3 measures of total species richness (vertebrates and plants). Supporting Information contains additional information on the effects of using different hotspot definitions (5%, 10%, 15%, and 25%). At the national scale, there was some evidence of a negative relationship between organic carbon stock and all 3 measures of terrestrial vertebrate richness (Table 1, Fig. 2). This negative relationship was significant at the 5% level for threatened species richness and restricted range species richness but was not significant for total species richness. However, this relationship did not hold when analyzed for islands independently (Table 1, Fig. 2). The relationship between carbon density and total species richness was either not significant or only weakly correlated for each of the major islands. With the inclusion of plants, results showed a strong negative relationship between carbon and overall species richness in Kalimantan (rs = −0.306, p < 0.001), and Sumatra (rs = −0.516, p < 0.001) (Table 1, Fig. 2d). This result reflected the fact that peat swamp forests store very large amounts of carbon but do not have particularly high overall plant species richness. The relationship between carbon density and threatened species richness was neither strong nor monotonic in any of the 4 major islands (Table 1, Fig. 2b). The relationship was strongest in Java, where the correlation was broadly positive (rs = 0.29, p < 0.001). Montane regions of Kalimantan and Papua coincided with the highest concentrations of restricted range vertebrate species (Fig 2c); however, these regions have relatively low carbon densities. Thus, a generally negative relationship between carbon and restricted range species richness was evident in Kalimantan (rs = −0.075, p = 0.016) and Papua (rs = −0.222, p < 0.001) (Table 2, Fig. 2c). The opposite trend was evident on Java (rs = 0.61, p < 0.001), where there was a nearly monotonic positive relationship between carbon and restricted range vertebrate species (Table 2, Fig. 2c), both of which are confined to remaining upland forests. The relationship between each measure of species richness and carbon was also greatly influenced by which taxa were included in the analyses; for example, restricted range birds (rs = 0.636, p < 0.001) and mammals (rs = 0.49, p < 0.001) in Java had strong positive correlation with carbon, whereas plants had a strong negative correlation with carbon in Sumatra (Supporting Information). We identified 36 active REDD+ projects in 15 provinces of Indonesia (25 projects reported as no longer active). Projects varied in size from site-level activities to those operating at the district or subprovince level. Over half (53%) of the project developers were conservation nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), 33% were private for-profit organizations, and 17% were projects established in collaboration with the Indonesian government or bilateral agencies. At least 25% of REDD+ project centroids overlapped with the boundaries of PAs (Supporting Information). The REDD+ forests tended to have, on average, lower carbon densities (mean = 433.5 t CO2/ha) than PAs (mean = 493.2 t CO2/ha) and unprotected forests in Indonesia (mean = 447.6 t CO2/ha) (Fig. 3a). Mean carbon density did not differ significantly between REDD+ projects and unprotected forests (F = 17.39 on 2877 df, p = 3.1 × 10−8) (Supporting Information). The REDD+ projects had significantly higher potential total vertebrate species richness (F = 130.2 on 2966 df, p = 2 × 10−16) and threatened species richness (F = 152.2 on 2930 df, p = 2 × 10−16) (Figs. 3b & 3c and Supporting Information). This relationship held true when plants were included in the measures of potential species richness (F = 16.35 on 2730 df, p = 8.77 × 10−8) (Supporting Information). Restricted range species showed a very different pattern; REDD+ projects and unprotected forests had on average lower potential species richness per cell than PAs (F = 17.2 on 1631 df, p = 4.07 × 10−8) (Fig. 3d) (Supporting Information). At least 23% (or 2.9 million ha) of the area of REDD+ projects was located in forests that had medium to high predicted deforestation threat, whereas 11% (or 2 million ha) of PA and 21% (or 20 million ha) of unprotected forest were under this level of threat. Forests currently not protected by REDD+ or PAs had a much larger area exposed to high deforestation threats; 1 million ha were predicted to be under very high deforestation threat (10–36% deforestation/ha) (Table 2). We found that patterns of biodiversity identified depended on the measure of biodiversity used; therefore, the protection of forests with the highest species richness (in Sumatra) may not protect forests with the highest number of threatened species (Kalimantan and coastal Sumatra) or restricted range species (highlands and small islands). Patterns of species richness were also highly variable between taxa, as has been demonstrated globally (Grenyer et al. 2006; Jenkins et al. 2013). Therefore, it is not possible for REDD+ projects to be located in such a way as to be good for all measures of biodiversity simultaneously. We found no clear and consistent relationship between carbon and any of our proxy measures of biodiversity in Indonesia, there was a weak negative relationship at the national scale, but relationships within islands were sometimes weakly positive, sometimes nonexistent, and sometimes strongly negative. The lack of a clear relationship between carbon and species richness has also been found in South Africa (Egoh et al. 2009) and Madagascar (Wendland et al. 2010). This is perhaps not surprising because of the fundamental ecological differences (definition and substitutability) between carbon and biodiversity (Potts et al. 2013). There are concerns that a lack of congruence between carbon and biodiversity could result in REDD+ investments focusing on high carbon areas which will put biodiversity at risk (Venter et al. 2009; Harrison & Paoli 2012). Although we did not find congruence between carbon stock densities and biodiversity richness in Indonesia, we also did not find REDD+ projects targeting areas with the highest carbon stocks. Instead, they seemed well positioned to deliver biodiversity gains because they tended to be located in areas with higher potential species richness (of total and threatened species). One factor which may explain why REDD+ projects in Indonesia tended to be located in areas important for biodiversity is that REDD+ development in Indonesia has been spearheaded by conservation NGOs. Such project developers may be seeing REDD+ as a novel funding stream for conservation rather than simply seeking to maximize potential carbon revenues. Our results for Indonesia are consistent with findings from studies in Tanzania (Lin et al. 2014) and Brazil (De Barros et al. 2014), which show evidence of REDD+ initiatives spatially targeting high biodiversity areas. The REDD+ project areas may tend to have lower than average carbon stock because remaining forests outside PAs have mostly been logged (Margono et al. 2014). We also found that many REDD+ projects in our sample are pursuing reforestation and forest restoration as their key project activities, we expect such projects with aims to enhance forest carbon stock to be located in degraded or secondary forests, with perhaps lower than average carbon content. Implementing REDD+ in PAs has been criticized as not being ""additional"" (Macdonald et al. 2011) because supposedly PAs are already conserved. However, given the underfunding of many PAs worldwide, it could be argued that improved funding could result in additional gains (Macdonald et al. 2011). Despite their protected status, many PAs in Indonesia are under continuing threat; over 12% of primary forest loss in Indonesia (2000–2012) is located in PAs (Margono et al. 2014), and enforcement is lax (Gaveau et al. 2012). Similarly, we found that PAs were not completely spared from the threat of deforestation; at least 11% (or >2 million ha) of PA area was in areas predicted to have medium to high deforestation threat. We found evidence that REDD+ is indeed being used to support conservation in Indonesia's PAs; at least 25% of REDD+ project boundaries overlapped with PAs (Supporting Information). If REDD+ funding could be used to increase the effectiveness of PAs, the benefits for biodiversity could be large. The REDD+ projects located adjacent to current PAs could also play an important role in softening the matrix, which would reduce the effective isolation of species in the PAs and improve population viability (Jantz et al. 2014). Peat swamp forests in Indonesia have global importance in climate mitigation and they are highly threatened because they represent the last frontiers for production of food, pulp, and biofuels (Posa et al. 2011). Recent findings show that 43% (2.6 million ha) of primary forest loss in Indonesia (2000–2012) took place in peatlands, which have an overall increasing rate of loss greater than lowland primary forests (Margono et al. 2014). A large number of REDD+ projects are located in carbon-rich peat swamp forests (Harrison & Paoli 2012). We also found this to be true; however, the total area covered by these projects was much smaller than the area covered by projects on mineral soils (Supporting Information). Highly threatened lowland forests, such as those in the lowlands of Borneo and Sumatra, should remain a priority for future REDD+ planning despite having below-average carbon content. Large expanses of selectively logged forests in Indonesia are now degraded and under high threat of conversion because these are prime agriculture lands where the Indonesian government intends to locate future palm-oil plantations in an attempt to divert palm-oil development away from carbon-rich peat swamp forests and pristine mineral soil forests (Gingold 2010). Margono et al. (2014) found that from 2000 to 2012, 98% (15.8 million ha) of forest loss took place in degraded forests. However, even heavily logged forests can be of high conservation value (Struebig et al. 2013). Meijaard and Sheil (2007) estimate that about 75% of Bornean orangutans (Pongo pygmaeus) live in logging concessions, and Sitompul et al. (2013) found that at least 1.6 million ha of Sumatran elephant (Elephas maximus sumatranus) habitat is in active logging concessions or in previously logged areas. These forests contain important biodiversity that would be reduced if they were logged again or cleared for oil palm or pulpwood plantations (Edwards et al. 2012). Opportunities for biodiversity in the REDD+ mechanism do not rely on the spatial congruence between carbon and biodiversity alone. The REDD+ policies are important if biodiversity conservation is to be integrated into the national REDD+ architecture (Phelps et al. 2012). Biodiversity-specific management will need to be incorporated in the planning, design, and implementation of REDD+ on the ground (Martin et al. 2013) because protecting existing forest carbon stocks alone will not automatically protect other forest values (Huettner 2012). Our results show that first-generation REDD+ projects in Indonesia are not necessarily located in the highest threat areas. This is consistent with the findings of Cerbu et al. (2011), who showed that predicted future deforestation appeared to be less of a criteria among first-generation developers for the location of REDD+ projects than the interests of NGOs or government agencies. Early REDD+ projects have built on prior forest management approaches, such as integrated conservation and development projects, as a springboard for REDD+ (Minang & van Noordwijk 2013) and a testing ground for proof of concept (Murdiyarso et al. 2012). The REDD+ projects in our study are in the early stages of development and are operating largely from bilateral REDD+ funding. As the REDD+ mechanism develops, the conditions under which project location is selected will differ; the non-colocation of carbon and biodiversity priority areas in Indonesia highlights an important structural feature which will affect the cost of delivering biodiversity cobenefits in future REDD+ projects. It can be assumed, based on our findings, that REDD+ projects located in forests most important for biodiversity will cost more per unit of carbon delivered than those located in high carbon forests because forests with the highest biodiversity tend to have low carbon densities but high threat to future deforestation due to high agriculture rent (Busch et al. 2010). Our results show that expanding REDD+ in forest with the lowest deforestation threat (generally on cheaper land) will have low incremental benefits for both biodiversity and carbon. We recommend that future research explicitly assess the costs associated with locating REDD+ projects in forests most important for biodiversity conservation, in light of the limited colocation between carbon and biodiversity we found. A future regulatory mechanism is likely to focus on cost-effective delivery of carbon benefits and not the large-scale delivery of noncarbon benefits (Busch 2013). Biodiversity conservation in the context of REDD+ is therefore likely to require additional investment (Phelps et al. 2012). Options include the introduction of premiums for the delivery of biodiversity benefits (Dinerstein et al. 2013), to allow REDD+ credits to protect forests that are carbon priorities, and use of supplementary funds to protect biodiversity priority areas even when they exhibit low carbon content (Venter et al. 2013). It is an empirical question which of these strategies would be more cost-effective under different contextual preconditions. We found that patterns of biodiversity varied strongly among taxa and depended on the measure of biodiversity. It would therefore not be possible to place REDD+ projects in areas which are universally good for all measures of biodiversity. In Indonesia carbon stocks correlate poorly with all measures of biodiversity both at the national level and within major islands. However, REDD+ projects under development in Indonesia were located in areas with below-average carbon stock but relatively high biodiversity (according to most measures we used), possibly reflecting the prominent role of conservation NGOs in the development of these first-generation REDD+ projects. Although nearly one-quarter of REDD+ project area was located where deforestation threat was predicted to be relatively high, the majority of REDD+ project area was not in highly threatened forests. This limits the opportunity to achieve the greatest benefits for both emissions reductions and biodiversity conservation. The patterns of biodiversity, threat, and locations of REDD+ projects in Indonesia suggest that biodiversity cobenefits could be achieved through REDD+ in Indonesia, especially if future expansion focused on areas under high deforestation threat. As the world looks toward a global mechanism to address climate change to be agreed upon at the 21st Conference of Parties in Paris at the end of 2015, our findings make an important contribution to debates surrounding the design of REDD+ to maximize the potential for cobenefits. The realized benefits of any REDD+ network will, of course, depend not only on the design and spatial planning but also on the effectiveness of interventions on the ground. We acknowledge G. S.

Amphibians and reptiles are recognized as sensitive indicators of ecosystem “health,” related to beneficial services (provisional, regulating, cultural, structural, functional) human societies receive from terrestrial watersheds. The Taguibo Watershed supplies fresh drinking water to Butuan City in the Caraga Region of northeast Mindanao Island. However, very little is known about the herpetofauna of the area. Here, we synthesize biodiversity data from historical (1971, 1979) and recent (2013, 2017) herpetological surveys from the region. We utilize specimen-associated occurrence records and natural history information to produce a species inventory, analyze their habitat utilization, and characterize diversity metrics to describe herpetological communities of the watershed – resulting in 44 species (27 new records). A number of historically-documented species persist, having partitioned riparian and terrestrial habitat types in dipterocarp and secondary-growth forests of Taguibo. Reptiles exhibit little overlap in the use of microhabitats – in contrast to amphibians, which exhibit either unique or frequently shared microhabitat substrates. In terrestrial microhabitats (not immediately associated with water), many newly-recorded reptiles and amphibians (particularly, of the genus Platymantis) partition space predictably – either occupying a single microhabitat or, in one species (a pit viper, Tropidolaemus subannulatus), two microhabitats. We anticipate that our initial characterization of Taguibo’s herpetofauna may serve as a baseline to promote further research and facilitate conservation initiatives. We emphasize the importance of primary sources – field-based surveys and re-surveys – and open-access biodiversity data served via online platforms that provide live, transparent access to original, unaltered data. Anthropogenic threats involving economic-driven activities present a need for field-based research in support of watershed management. Periodic, survey, and re-survey studies – continuously updating earlier work – are the most reliable, repeatable, and publicly-transparent use of biodiversity survey data in support of societal benefits and ecosystem services.",1,0,0.015949555,openalex

The key to understanding these dynamics is to consider patterns of environmental heterogeneity, including patterns produced by natural and anthropogenic disturbance. We studied how spatial variation in three aspects of biodiversity of terrestrial gastropods (species richness, species diversity, and nestedness) on the 16-ha Luquillo Forest Dynamics Plot (LFDP) in a tropical forest of Puerto Rico was affected by disturbance caused by Hurricanes Hugo and Georges, as well as by patterns of historic land use. Hurricane-induced changes in spatial organization of species richness differed from those for species diversity. The gamma components of species richness changed after the hurricanes and were significantly different between Hurricanes Hugo and Georges. Alpha and two beta components of species richness, one related to turnover among sites within areas of similar land use and one related to variation among areas of different land use, varied randomly over time after both hurricanes. In contrast, gamma components of species diversity decreased in indistinguishable manners after both hurricanes, whereas the rates of change in the alpha component of species diversity differed between hurricanes. Beta components of diversity related to turnover among sites declined after both hurricanes in a consistent fashion. Those related to turnover among areas with different historic land uses varied stochastically. The immediate effect of hurricanes was to reduce nestedness of gastropod assemblages. Thereafter, nestedness increased during post-hurricane secondary succession, and did so in the same way, regardless of patterns of historic land use. The rates of change in degree of nestedness during secondary succession were different after each hurricane as a result of differences in the severity and extent of the hurricane-induced damage. Our analyses quantified temporal changes in the spatial organization of biodiversity of gastropod assemblages during forest recovery from hurricane-induced damage in areas that had experienced different patterns of historic human land use, and documented the dependence of biodiversity on spatial scale. We hypothesize that cross-scale interactions, likely those between the local demographics of species at the fine scale and the landscape configuration of patches at the broad scale, play a dominant role in affecting critical transfer processes, such as dispersal, and its interrelationship with aspects of biodiversity. Cross-scale interactions have significant implications for the conservation of biodiversity, as the greatest threats to biodiversity arise from habitat modification and fragmentation associated with disturbance arising from human activities. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",1,0,0.013905981,positives

Common eiders (Somateria mollissima (L. 1758)) nest on coastal islands and forage in intertidal and shallow subtidal waters. We considered several biotic and abiotic factors, their interactions, and how these might influence the distribution of eider colonies at several spatial scales in Labrador, Canada. At the island level, nest abundance was not related to intertidal prey density. At the 104 km2 grid scale, eider nest abundance and the coefficient of dispersion (CD; the variance to mean ratio of colony size or grid cell, where CD indicates population dispersion) were negatively related to the number of islands. Spring ice cover was positively related to the number of islands but was negatively related to eider nest abundance and to CD. Ice cover – abundance and ice cover – CD were significant at two spatial scales (104 and 455 km2, respectively), but other relationships were weaker at the larger spatial scale. We hypothesize that during the spring, archipelagos with many islands trap ice, providing terrestrial predators access to nesting islands by acting as bridges and that increased predation reduces habitat quality causing nesting eiders to disperse. Our findings suggest that eiders respond to landscape features, including ice cover, a feature that is being influenced by climate change.",1,0,0.015857106,openalex

The hydrologic connectivity between landscape elements and streams means that fragmentation of terrestrial habitats could affect the distribution of stream faunas at multiple spatial scales. We investigated how catchment- and site-scale influences, including proportion and position of forest cover within a catchment, and presence of riparian forest cover affected the distribution of a diadromous fish.
 
 2. The occurrence of koaro (Galaxias brevipinnis) in 50-m stream reaches with either forested or non-forested riparian margins at 172 sites in 24 catchments on Banks Peninsula, South Island, New Zealand was analysed. Proportions of catchments forested and the dominant position (upland or lowland) of forest within catchments were determined using geographical information system spatial analysis tools.
 
 3. Multivariate analysis of variance indicated forest position and proportion forested at the catchment accounted for the majority of the variation in the overall proportion of sites in a catchment with koaro.
 
 4. Where forest was predominantly in the lower part of the catchments, the presence of riparian cover was important in explaining the proportion of sites with koaro. However, where forest was predominantly in the upper part of the catchment, the effect of riparian forest was not as strong. In the absence of riparian forest cover, no patterns of koaro distribution with respect to catchment forest cover or forest position were detected.
 
 5.

Marine taxa inhabiting the archipelago might be expected to be an exception, because of their utilization of pelagic habitats-the dispersal barrier for terrestrial taxa-as foraging grounds. Magnificent frigatebirds (Fregata magnificens) have a highly vagile lifestyle and wide geographical distribution around the South and Central American coasts. Given the potentially high levels of gene flow among populations, the species provides a good test of the effectiveness of the Galapagos ecosystem in isolating populations of highly dispersive marine species. We studied patterns of genetic (mitochondrial DNA, microsatellites and nuclear introns) and morphological variation across the distribution of magnificent frigatebirds. Concordant with predictions from life-history traits, we found signatures of extensive gene flow over most of the range, even across the Isthmus of Panama, which is a major barrier to gene flow in other tropical seabirds. In contrast, individuals from the Galapagos were strongly differentiated from all conspecifics, and have probably been isolated for several hundred thousand years. Our finding is a powerful testimony to the evolutionary uniqueness of the taxa inhabiting the Galapagos archipelago and its associated marine ecosystems.",1,0,0.118527845,openalex

We examined the use of sandy beach resources by the threatened island fox (Urocyon littoralis) on the California Channel Islands using scat analysis, surveys of potential prey, beach habitat attributes, and stable isotope analysis. Consumption of beach invertebrates, primarily intertidal talitrid amphipods (Megalorchestia spp.) by island fox varied with abundance of these prey across sites. Distance-based linear modeling revealed that abundance of giant kelp (Macrocystis pyrifera) wrack, rather than beach physical attributes, explained the largest amount of variation in talitrid amphipod abundance and biomass across beaches. δ13C and δ15N values of fox whisker (vibrissae) segments suggested individualism in diet, with generally low δ13C and δ15N values of some foxes consistent with specializing on primarily terrestrial foods, contrasting with the higher isotope values of other individuals that suggested a sustained use of sandy beach resources, the importance of which varied over time.

Caribou are a key component of the arctic food web and the bioaccumulation of toxic contaminants, such as mercury (Hg), needs to be monitored to establish a baseline as the arctic environment is impacted by both climate change and future industrial development. A changing climate in Alaska is influencing plant species composition, fire regime, melting and flooding events, and thus, impacting Hg bioavailability in the food chain. Industrial development in Asia is also projected to increase the atmospheric global pool of Hg from increased coal combustion. Reindeer, a domesticated representative of caribou, can be used as a terrestrial biomonitor for metal exposure. In this study total mercury concentrations were measured in lichens and in hair of grazing reindeer on defined ranges across Alaska to establish a baseline for future hypothesis development and testing regarding Hg deposition. The Hg mean level for Seward Peninsula lichens on the Davis Range was 37.4 ng g−1, on the Gray Range 47.1 ng g−1, on the Kakaruk Range 42.2 ng g−1, and 41.7 ng g−1 on the Noyakuk Range. Lichen Hg levels on St. Lawrence Island was 46.6 ng g−1. Methyl mercury levels in lichens were found to be below detection levels. Reindeer grazing on these ranges had mean Hg hair levels of 14.6 ng g−1 (Davis herd), 83.4 ng g−1 (Gray herd), and 40.3 ng g−1 (Noyakuk herd). Two reindeer on St. Lawrence Island had an average of Hg of 43.0 ng g−1. Sample sizes ranged from n = 2 to n = 11. Hg mean levels in lichen on Seward Peninsula were higher than Hg means of two ranges in northern Mongolia. The Hg levels observed in this study indicate that Hg levels in Alaska are low at this time and pose no risk to the health of reindeer or human subsistence harvesters. A significant relationship between Hg in lichens on the ranges and the Hg in reindeer on those ranges has not been established. There are insufficient data on Hg levels in many areas of the north and more information is needed on location specific and time trends in Hg concentrations.

Professor Richard West has been at the forefront of the development of Quaternary science in the UK for some four decades or so. During this period, he has focused his attention on the investigation of a number of important Pleistocene sections and boreholes located throughout East Anglia and neighbouring districts, initially under the leadership of, but subsequently as successor to, Sir Harry Godwin at the sub-department of Quaternary Research in Cambridge. This work led to a steady stream of meticulous reports on the geology and plant history of the Pleistocene in Britain, with a number of these widely acknowledged to be classic and innovative publications. Indeed, his classification of different temperate stages of the Pleistocene, based on his analyses of pollen assemblage and plant macrofossil data published during the 1950s and 1960s, still underpins the terminology and structure of much of the stratigraphic scheme employed for the Pleistocene in the UK (Jones & Keen 1993; Bowen 1999). In view of his influential role in the development of the subject, his extensive experience of the study of exposed sediment sequences in a wide spectrum of geological contexts, and his insight into the influence of taphonomic factors on the fossil plant record, any new treatise by R.G. West on the interpretation of the Quaternary plant record surely merits close attention. This book presents a synthesis that complements West’s earlier works on the temperate-stage plant record, this time focusing on the accumulated fossil plant record from cold stage deposits in the British Isles. It is the first comprehensive treatment of its subject. West has not only scrutinized the pollen assemblage and plant macrofossil records of cold stage deposits recovered from many sites in the UK, but has also travelled extensively throughout Svalbard, the Canadian Arctic Archipelago, the Yukon, the North-west Territories and arctic Alaska to examine modern plant assemblages, in order to assess their potential as suitable analogues for understanding fossil assemblages. The book has three interwoven strands: an attempt to provide a coherent summary of the large amount of data obtained from cold stage floras from sites in the British Isles; a comprehensive, quantitative archive and classification of these data in the form of an electronic data base; and consideration of some of the general conclusions that can be drawn from this comprehensive record. This review will examine each of these strands in turn. The ‘raw’ data are the published and unpublished plant records (pollen and/or plant macrofossil assemblages) available to West up to the data-entry date of 1995. As a prelude to the interpretation of these data, Chapter 1 introduces the importance of the assembly of such a comprehensive archive. The questions posed, which such an archive can help to address, are rather fundamental ones, about the past distribution and behaviour of plant species, and about the use of the fossil plant record for reconstructing past environments, including climate conditions. Chapter 2 attempts to provide a general geological setting (stratigraphic scheme and definitions, dating of sequences, glacial limits in the British Isles), while Chapter 3 introduces the typical sedimentary environments in which the various fossil records probably accumulated, as well as the range of taphonomic problems with which the Quaternary palaeobotanist has to grapple. I suspect that the three introductory chapters will prove somewhat confusing for readers not familiar with the underlying stratigraphic terminology and concepts. On the other hand, the treatment seems too skeletal for those more expert in the field, who will nod enthusiastically at the mention of various stratigraphic or taphonomic issues, but who, like me, might feel a little frustrated with the relatively limited treatment they receive. However, I do recognize the ‘no-win dilemma’ that West must have faced in trying to satisfy both constituencies. Nevertheless, many readers will surely be discouraged by the use of such terms as ‘palaeolithoclimatic’ and ‘palaeobioclimatic’ in early passages of the book, terms that are likely to be confusing for some, while raising questions in the minds of others about their specific definition and application. The sites from which the records were obtained are introduced in Chapter 5. The geographical bias of the data from the British Isles becomes apparent immediately, with the vast majority of the records from central and eastern England. This mainly reflects the preponderance in these parts of the country of records for intervals that predate the last glacial stage. In other districts, any comparable records that existed in the past have largely been removed by advancing ice sheets, or periglacial or other processes that promoted ground surface instability. However, it also reflects the region of main interest to West. A number of important records have been omitted. For example, there are only three records listed from Scotland (including the Scottish Islands), four from Ireland, one from the south-west counties of England, and none from Wales. The records included in the data base vary markedly in the number and type of fossils represented, their age, their state of preservation, and the sedimentary context inferred for the period during which they accumulated. These and other constraints on the data are laid out clearly by West, who also discusses some of the uncertainties these constraints introduce. Chapter 4 describes the electronic archive, which is captured in a CD ROM distributed with the book (included in purchase cost). The electronic formatting and structure take a little time to get used to, as the data are presented in ASCII comma-delimited macro-files. While these can be opened and manipulated in EXCEL, I could find no explanation of the necessary procedures that would assist the novice. The tables provide quantified information for each site record on number and type of taxa recorded, the modern habitat for each taxon, modern distributions, and stratigraphic age of records, as well as bibliographic details for sources of the ‘raw’ data. They are not, however, instantly illuminating, and quite a bit of work is required on the part of the operator to establish what meaningful patterns are locked in the data. This raises the question of the usefulness of circulating the data in this manner. Most readers would, I am sure, have preferred the data to have been presented in a more digested and/or interactive format whereas those intending to use the data for research purposes could easily access them if they were made available through the internet. Chapters 6–12 range through various biogeographical parameters that can be inferred from the data, based on (inter alia) the elements of the flora represented, the frequency of occurrence of selected taxa, species variability, and aspects of growth, reproduction and dispersal. Here is where it could have been extremely useful to have been able to work in tandem between the text and the CD ROM, but I could not find a quick way of achieving this. Those more expert in the handling of data bases might have greater success, but for those less practised in the art, some pointers would have been useful. Chapters 11 and 12 present some of the West’s broad conclusions concerning the habitats represented in the data base, as well as certain phytogeographical inferences that emerge from his analysis of the full data base. The third section of the book constitutes the many valuable insights into the problems of interpreting fossil plant records from cold stage deposits. These are scattered throughout the volume, so that the reader has to work hard to find and link them together, with the result that impact is not maximized. There are interesting comments made at irregular intervals about the distinctiveness of the cold stage floras of Britain, and how they differ, sometimes quite markedly, from present-day arctic floras. For example, therophytes occur in relatively high percentages in fossil floras compared with modern arctic communities. There are intriguing questions raised, for example, about the consequences of the development of an arctic-like environment at the latitude of the British Isles, for plants and insects. Again, however, I craved some further conjecture from West as to plausible answers to these questions. The final chapters address some broader themes, such as palaeoclimate reconstructions based upon biological and other information, comparisons of plant records with contemporaneous records of other biota, and a discussion of the ‘Origin and fate of the cold stage stadial flora’. These raise a number of issues familiar to Quaternary palaeobiologists, the overarching thesis being that the biomes that developed in low-latitude regions during ‘stadial’ times were not analogous to those that can be observed in northern latitudes today. There is a cri de coeur in the book for a new terminology to describe past formations, which is independent of the terms applied to define modern formations that have strict climatic connotations. West suggests that the new definitions could be based on the inferred physiognomy of the past vegetation, the benefits of which are not immediately apparent. This may introduce as many problems as are solved. Yet again, a fuller discussion of the issue would have been welcomed. Overall, I have mixed feelings about the book. On the one hand, the data base is an extremely valuable one, and we Quaternary scientists should be grateful to West for pulling all of this information together in a condensed fashion. On the other hand, I did feel that perhaps the opportunity was not grasped to turn a worthy book into a more exciting one. As already noted, there are places where the crucial arguments are not developed enough. There are also some surprising omissions. For me, the most surprising of all is the lack of any significant reference to recently published ice-core records, and to the implications they have for the interpretation of past ‘stadial’ and ‘interstadial’. The remarkable GRIP and GISP records of the last cold stage, for example, which have evidence for up to 24 extremely abrupt and quasi-cyclic Dansgaard–Oeschger cycles (warmings of some 7 °C), raise some fundamental questions of relevance to interpretation of the terrestrial record, as do detailed marine records for the last cold stage, which provide evidence for less frequent, but equally significant, Heinrich Events. These were dramatically sudden cooling events that appear to have had global impacts (Leuschner & Sirocko, 2000). The growing evidence for frequent, very short-lived climate oscillations during cold stages calls into question traditional definitions of ‘stadial’ and ‘interstadial’ events and their associated floras. The likely responses of biota to this kind of oscillatory palaeoclimate background are very difficult to envisage, and represent a challenge to palaeobotanists for future research. Presumably the starting point for such a pursuit is the construction of rigorous archives of the fossil record of the type assembled by West, followed by close scrutiny of the data they contain. It seems quite apt, therefore, that his book closes with the following statement: The database given here (to 1995) can be expanded as new fossil assemblages are described, as taxonomy and definition improves, as dating is improved and as stratigraphy is revised. The present database and the interpretation of cold stage floras discussed here will hopefully form a sound basis for these developments. True, but it is not made clear whether this final message is an invitation to the community to participate in making this a community-shared facility. I hope it is. This book should be considered an essential addition to libraries and laboratories that aim to maintain a comprehensive coverage of publications in Quaternary stratigraphy and/or palaeobotanical research. It is also a key reference for all those embarking on research projects in Quaternary palaeobotany, and a useful reference for those on the fringe of this specialist subject. With respect to the quality of production of the volume, the cover design and fabric, paper and print, and the colour photographs are all of excellent quality. The line diagrams are generally well constructed. Sadly, some of the black-and-white photographs lack contrast, and I could not read the scales in one or two. But, on the whole, it is quite an attractive little book.",1,0,0.01931159,openalex

We developed a high-resolution surface flux inversion system based on the global Eulerian–Lagrangian coupled tracer transport model composed of the National Institute for Environmental Studies (NIES) transport model (TM; collectively NIES-TM) and the FLEXible PARTicle dispersion model (FLEXPART). The inversion system is named NTFVAR (NIES-TM–FLEXPART-variational) as it applies a variational optimization to estimate surface fluxes. We tested the system by estimating optimized corrections to natural surface CO2 fluxes to achieve the best fit to atmospheric CO2 data collected by the global in situ network as a necessary step towards the capability of estimating anthropogenic CO2 emissions. We employed the Lagrangian particle dispersion model (LPDM) FLEXPART to calculate surface flux footprints of CO2 observations at a spatial resolution of 0.1∘×0.1∘. The LPDM is coupled with a global atmospheric tracer transport model (NIES-TM). Our inversion technique uses an adjoint of the coupled transport model in an iterative optimization procedure. The flux error covariance operator was implemented via implicit diffusion. Biweekly flux corrections to prior flux fields were estimated for the years 2010–2012 from in situ CO2 data included in the Observation Package (ObsPack) data set. High-resolution prior flux fields were prepared using the Open-Data Inventory for Anthropogenic Carbon dioxide (ODIAC) for fossil fuel combustion, the Global Fire Assimilation System (GFAS) for biomass burning, the Vegetation Integrative SImulator for Trace gases (VISIT) model for terrestrial biosphere exchange, and the Ocean Tracer Transport Model (OTTM) for oceanic exchange. The terrestrial biospheric flux field was constructed using a vegetation mosaic map and a separate simulation of CO2 fluxes at a daily time step by the VISIT model for each vegetation type. The prior flux uncertainty for the terrestrial biosphere was scaled proportionally to the monthly mean gross primary production (GPP) by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) MOD17 product. The inverse system calculates flux corrections to the prior fluxes in the form of a relatively smooth field multiplied by high-resolution patterns of the prior flux uncertainties for land and ocean, following the coastlines and fine-scale vegetation productivity gradients. The resulting flux estimates improved the fit to the observations taken at continuous observation sites, reproducing both the seasonal and short-term concentration variabilities including high CO2 concentration events associated with anthropogenic emissions. The use of a high-resolution atmospheric transport in global CO2 flux inversions has the advantage of better resolving the transported mixed signals from the anthropogenic and biospheric sources in densely populated continental regions. Thus, it has the potential to achieve better separation between fluxes from terrestrial ecosystems and strong localized sources, such as anthropogenic emissions and forest fires. Further improvements in the modelling system are needed as our posterior fit was better than that of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)'s CarbonTracker for only a fraction of the monitoring sites, i.e. mostly at coastal and island locations where background and local flux signals are mixed.",1,0,0.0029271103,openalex
