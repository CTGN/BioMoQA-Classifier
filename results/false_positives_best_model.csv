Understanding how matrix dynamics, especially secondary forest regrowth, can lessen fragmentation impacts is key to understanding species persistence in modified landscapes. Here, we use a whole-ecosystem fragmentation experiment to investigate how bat assemblages are influenced by the regeneration of the secondary forest matrix. We surveyed bats in continuous forest, forest fragments and secondary forest matrix habitats, ~15 and ~30 years after forest clearance, to investigate temporal changes in the occupancy and abundance of old-growth specialist and habitat generalist species. The regeneration of the second growth matrix had overall positive effects on the occupancy and abundance of specialists across all sampled habitats. Conversely, effects on generalist species were negligible for forest fragments and negative for secondary forest. Our results show that the conservation potential of secondary forests for reverting faunal declines in fragmented tropical landscapes increases with secondary forest age and that old-growth specialists, which are often of most conservation concern, are the greatest beneficiaries of secondary forest maturation. Our findings emphasize that the transposition of patterns of biodiversity persistence in island ecosystems to fragmented terrestrial settings can be hampered by the dynamic nature of human-dominated landscapes.",0,1,0.8176377,openalex

Such an analysis will not only provide insights into the traits related to invasiveness, but also the habitat characteristics that underpin vulnerability to invasion that, taken together, will facilitate the selection of management strategies to mitigate the invader's effect. In the present study, we considered the Mediterranean basin islands as an excellent study region to test how the same invasive species perform in different habitats within a single island, and to scale up differences among islands with similar climate. We tested how the performance of three widespread plant invaders with clonal growth but contrasting life-history traits, a deciduous tree Ailanthus altissima, a succulent subshrub Carpobrotus spp., and an annual geophyte Oxalis pes-caprae, varied depending upon the species identity, habitat, and invaded island. The environmental parameters considered were habitat type, elevation, species diversity in the invaded plot, and several soil traits (% C, % N, C/N, pH, and relative humidity). The study documents that the performance of these three important and widespread plant invaders is dependent mainly on species identity, and less upon the invaded island's general features. Likewise, differences in performance among habitats were only significant in the case of Ailanthus, whereas Carpobrotus and Oxalis appear to perform equally well in different environments. Ailanthus thus appears to have a broader spectrum of invasiveness, being able to invade a larger number of habitat types. On the contrary, Carpobrotus spp. have not yet invaded habitats different from those where the species have been originally introduced and where they are still commonly spread by humans. Oxalis distribution is mainly related to agricultural activities and disturbed sites, and the total area infested by this geophyte may be more reflection of the extent of suitable habitats than of invasiveness or ecological impact. Our results confirm the potential for these species to significantly alter the functioning of ecosystems in the Mediterranean islands and highlight the risk to other islands not yet invaded. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",0,1,0.9966208,negatives

A survey of aquatic and semiaquatic Heteroptera from Cuba is provided based on literature reports and field collections. General data on species geographical distribution are given, along with altitude and collection season. Representatives of 86 species and morphospecies of the infraorders Dipsocoromorpha, Leptopodomorpha, Gerromorpha and Nepomorpha are listed, distributed in 35 genera and 16 families were found. Based on distributional data, a preference for habitats of stagnant water or slow current and lower altitudes is inferred. Fifteen species are distributed throughout the entire island. A higher species diversity was found in the Eastern sector, with 53 species (61.63%), 16 of which (18.60%) are confined to this area.

However, little is known about the effects of canyons on fish biodiversity, in particular on oceanic islands, which are imbedded in regions of low productivity. Using submersibles and high-definition video surveys, we investigated demersal fish assemblages in two submarine canyons and slope areas off the island of Moloka'i, Hawai'i, at depths ranging from 314 to 1100m. We addressed the interactions between the abundance, species richness and composition of the fish assemblage, and organic matter input and habitat heterogeneity, testing the hypotheses that heterogeneous bottom habitats and higher organic matter input in canyons enhance demersal fish abundance, and species density, richness and diversity, thereby driving differences in assemblage structure between canyons and slopes. Sediment type, substrate inclination, water-mass properties (temperature and dissolved oxygen) and organic matter input (modeled POC flux and percent detritus occurrence) were put into multivariate multiple regression models to identify potential drivers of fish assemblage structure. A total of 824 fish were recorded during ~13h of video yielding 55 putative species. Macrouridae was the most diverse family with 13 species, followed by Congridae (5), Ophidiidae (4) and Halosauridae (3). Assemblage structure changed markedly with depth, with the most abrupt change in species composition occurring between the shallowest stratum (314-480m) and intermediate and deep strata (571-719m, 946-1100m). Chlorophthalmus sp. dominated the shallow stratum, macrourids and synaphobranchid eels at intermediate depths, and halosaurs in the deepest stratum. Assemblages only differed significantly between canyon and slope habitats for the shallow stratum, and the deep stratum at one site. Dissolved oxygen explained the greatest proportion of variance in the multivariate data, followed by POC flux and percent organic-detritus occurrence. Fish abundances were generally higher in canyons but only statistically significant for the deepest stratum. Reduced fish abundances both in canyon and slope transects occurred at intermediate depths within the core of the oxygen minimum zone (OMZ). Species density, diversity and richness and abundance were usually higher in the canyons, but only statistically higher in the deepest stratum. Possible causes for increased abundance and species densities and richness in the deepest stratum in canyons include reduced disturbance at deeper depths. We conclude that submarine canyons on oceanic islands are likely to be sites of enhanced fish abundance and species richness, but that these enhancing effects are offset when oxygen concentrations fall below ~0.7mll -1 in OMZs. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.",0,1,0.90177727,negatives

Classical taxonomic approaches, complemented by molecular tools, are improving our understanding of the systematic relationships of some species, changing the nomenclature of taxa and challenging the taxonomic status of others. The springtail Friesea grisea has previously been described as the only species with a ""pan-Antarctic"" distribution. However, recent genetic comparisons have pointed to another scenario. The latest morphological study has confined F. grisea to the sub-Antarctic island of South Georgia, from which it was originally described, and resurrected F. antarctica as a congeneric species occurring on the continental mainland. Molecular data demonstrate that populations of this taxon, ostensibly occurring across Maritime and Continental Antarctica, as well as on some offshore islands, are evolutionarily isolated and divergent and cannot be included within a single species. The present study, combining morphological with molecular data, attempts to validate this hypothesis and challenges the taxonomic status of F. antarctica, suggesting that two additional new species, described here as Friesea gretae sp. nov. and Friesea propria sp. nov., are present in Continental Antarctica.",0,1,0.99670213,openalex

Five lagoonal zones based on population densities around the coast of Tahiti were identified, and within each zone a transect from the fringing reef to the barrier reef was sampled, a total of 18 stations. Only large macrofauna collected on a 2 mm sieve were considered in this study. Multivariate analysis using total biomass and environmental factors showed that the stations formed 3 main groups which were related to sediment characteristics, including percentage of silt, organic matter and phaeopigment levels. The distribution of the major feeding groups was related to the amounts of terrestrial inputs and distance from the shore. The stations on the barrier reef and those in zones adjacent to low population areas were not impacted by these terrestrial inputs. Deposit-feeding communities of capitellid polychaetes were dominant in the channel parts of the lagoon, which acted as decanting ponds. Chaetopterid polychaetes played an important role in recycling sediments of terrigenous origin in the fringing ecosystem. The patterns of diversity, density and biomass of the benthos around the lagoon revealed that some areas were impacted by moderate terrigenous inputs. It appears that the intermediate disturbance hypothesis explains the functioning of the parts of the benthic lagoonal ecosystem which are subjected to human impact. The organic enrichment by terrestrial inputs contrasts with food limitation that appears to occur in the non-disturbed areas. Despite high organic loads, the benthic communities present at the harbour station were not depauperate, as bioturbation by burrowing alpheids and callianassids prevented anoxic conditions from developing.

Supralittoral invertebrates restricted to specific coastal patchy habitats, however, have the potential for high levels of allopatric diversification. This is the case of Ligia isopods endemic to the Hawaiian Archipelago, which most likely arose from a rocky supralittoral ancestor that colonized the archipelago via rafting, and diversified into rocky supralittoral and inland lineages. A previous study on populations of this isopod from Oʻahu and Kauaʻi revealed high levels of allopatric differentiation, and suggested inter-island historical dispersal events have been rare. To gain a better understanding on the diversity and evolution of this group, we expanded prior phylogeographic work by incorporating populations from unsampled main Hawaiian Islands (Maui, Molokaʻi, Lanaʻi, and Hawaiʻi), increasing the number of gene markers (four mitochondrial and two nuclear genes), and conducting Maximum likelihood and Bayesian phylogenetic analyses. Our study revealed new lineages and expanded the distribution range of several lineages. The phylogeographic patterns of Ligia in the study area are complex, with Hawaiʻi, Oʻahu, and the Maui-Nui islands sharing major lineages, implying multiple inter-island historical dispersal events. In contrast, the oldest and most geographically distant of the major islands (Kauaʻi) shares no lineages with the other islands. Our results did not support the monophyly of all the supralittoral lineages (currently grouped into L. hawaiensis), or the monophyly of the terrestrial lineages (currently grouped into L. perkinsi), implying more than one evolutionary transition between coastal and inland forms. Geometric-morphometric analyses of three supralittoral clades revealed significant body shape differences among them. A taxonomic revision of Hawaiian Ligia is warranted. Our results are relevant for the protection of biodiversity found in an environment subject to high pressure from disturbances.",0,1,0.9926416,openalex

Low lake levels are assumed to have caused the BIA to be attached to mainland Michigan for at least 4000 years (10000 yr B.P.- 6000 yr B.P.), eventually, rising lake levels would have kept the islands isolated since 6000 yr B.P. If the island populations of a plant species in the BIA were indeed once continuous with the mainland of Michigan, then we would expect similar levels of genetic diversity in populations of such a species on the islands vs. the mainland. We compared levels of allozyme genetic diversity of 20 plots of Pinus strobus in the BIA with two mainland populations in northern Michigan. In addition, if pollen is a primary agent of gene flow across islands, a low degree of allozyme differentiation among the island populations of P. strobus in the BIA would be evident. Furthermore, since seed dispersal is more limited than pollen dispersal in P. strobus, a more pronounced spatial genetic structure (SGS) is expected in allozymes than in cpDNA markers. To gain insights on the pattern of seed and pollen dispersal among the 20 plots, we further analyzed spatial autocorrelation using Moran's I-statistics for both data sets [biparentally inherited, allozymes and paternally inherited, cpDNA microsatellites (cpDNA SSR)]. We found a similar level of allozyme variability in both the BIA (mean H e = 0.080) and the two mainland populations (mean H e = 0.078). As predicted, we observed a low but significant degree of genetic divergence among populations for allozymes (mean F ST = 0.033 across 20 plots). Our allozyme-based SGS analysis revealed significant evidence of SGS (i.e. isolation-by-distance; slope β = -0.194 from regression analysis of observed averaged Moran's I values against the logarithm of the upper bound of six distance classes). In contrast, little evidence of SGS was found in cpDNA SSR data across the BIA (β = 0.013). These results suggest that although gene flow via seed dispersal is somewhat limited, pollen flow has been sufficient to maintain genetic diversity and prevent differentiation across the island landscape over several thousand years of isolation. © 2007 Springer-Verlag.",0,1,0.9470254,negatives

Additionally, the environmental variables underpinning these patterns have not been extensively studied, nor have the relationships between squamate species richness and biome variety, a proxy for habitat heterogeneity. Here, we deconstruct the latitudinal diversity gradient of squamates and investigate lizard and snake species richness in relation to environmental gradients and biomes across continental North America. Location: North America, excluding islands. Taxon: Squamata (lizards and snakes). Methods: We collated a suite of environmental variables (n = 10) and squamate species ranges (n = 1,152) in an equal-area grid system (100 × 100 km cells) spanning continental North America. We deconstructed the latitudinal diversity gradient of squamates and examined species richness patterns for all lizards, all snakes and several individual squamate clades. We used multiple linear regressions to determine which environmental factors are most important for each squamate clade. Finally, we documented species richness within biomes and tested for correlations between species richness and biome variety. Results: Squamates exhibit a strong latitudinal diversity gradient across continental North America. Snakes are more widespread and have a stronger gradient than lizards. Our multiple linear regression results indicate strong associations between species richness and environmental variables for all individual squamate clades analysed; temperature variables are strongly positively correlated with species richness. Biome variety is more strongly correlated with lizard species richness than snake species richness. Squamates are most species-rich in tropical/subtropical forests, deserts and mangroves. Main conclusions: Most snake clades in North America exhibit strong latitudinal diversity gradients, but only two lizard clades, Dactyloidae (anoles) and Gekkota (geckos), display strong gradients and thus drive the overall lizard pattern. Squamate clades differ in their responses to environmental gradients, as reflected by their species richness patterns, with warmer climates generally harboring more species. Lizards are more strongly associated with habitat heterogeneity than snakes are, consistent with results from previous studies. Squamates in more rapidly shifting biomes (e.g. deserts, mangroves) may face a greater risk of extinction from impending climate change. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",0,1,0.9855657,negatives

We analysed the newly compiled list of casual and naturalized plant species in Taiwan (probably the only complete data set of this kind in East Asia) and found that Taiwan is relatively lightly invaded with only 8% of the flora being casual or naturalized. Moreover, the index of casual and naturalized species per log area is also moderate, in striking contrast with many other island floras where contributions of naturalized species are much higher. Casual and naturalized species have accumulated steadily and almost linearly over the past decades. Fabaceae, Asteraceae, and Poaceae are the families with the most species. However, Amaranthaceae, Convolvulaceae, and Onagraceae have the largest ratios of casual and naturalized species to their global numbers. Ipomoea, Solanum and Crotalaria have the highest numbers of casual and naturalized species. About 60% of all genera with exotic species are new to Taiwan. Perennial herbs represent one third of the casual and naturalized flora, followed by annual herbs. About 60% of exotic species were probably introduced unintentionally onto the island; many species imported intentionally have ornamental, medicinal, or forage values. The field status of 50% of these species is unknown, but ornamentals represent noticeable proportions of naturalized species, while forage species represent a relatively larger proportion of casual species. Species introduced for medicinal purposes seem to be less invasive. Most of the casual and naturalized species of Taiwan originated from the Tropical Americas, followed by Asia and Europe.",0,1,0.9962204,negatives

In Andean Patagonia, southern Argentina and Chile, many non-native animals have been introduced and are currently spreading. On Isla Victoria, Nahuel Huapi National Park, many non-native vertebrates were introduced ca. 1937. Records indicate that several native vertebrates were present before these species were introduced. We hypothesize that seven decades after the introduction of non-native species and without appropriate management to maintain native diversity, non-native vertebrates have displaced native species (given the known invasiveness and impacts of some of the introduced species). We conducted direct censuses in linear transects 500 m long (n = 10) in parallel with camera-trapping (1,253 camera-days) surveys in two regions of the island with different levels of disturbance: high (n = 4) and low (n = 6) to study the community of terrestrial mammals and birds and the relative abundances of native and non-native species. Results show that currently non-native species are dominant across all environments; 60.4% of census records and 99.7% of camera trapping records are of non-native animals. We detected no native large mammals; the assemblage of large vertebrates consisted of five non-native mammals and one non-native bird. Native species detected were one small mammal and one small bird. Species with the highest trapping rate were red and fallow deer, wild boar, silver pheasant (all four species are non-native) and chucao (a native bird).

Tourism also has direct and indirect consequences for the unique archipelago's natural habitats and for the human well-being. Describing the mechanisms that drive and affect most the tourism development in Galapagos is a preliminary condition to developing a better understanding of the interaction structure of factors that shape the Galapagos archipelago as a social-ecological complex system. In this paper, we present a first attempt to represent the touristic market in Galapagos trough an Agent Based Model (ABM) of touristic activity, focusing on touristic offers, reservations, and touristic activities. The model is based on an individual-based representation of tourists' consumption preferences and touristic accommodation offers in the Galapagos Islands. Tourist agents are created to mimic the real world by assigning average characteristics of individuals who visit the Galapagos Archipelago of Ecuador. The accommodation offers (i.e., hotels and cruises) are generated in accordance with actual conditions derived from data collected through field surveys. The model includes a market agent that can change the prices, create and delete accommodation offers following an evolutionary algorithm. We carried out preliminary simulations that show a close agreement between real world data and model outputs. Furthermore we used the model to generate three 'what if' scenarios in order to study how emergent patterns in the touristic market in Galapagos are affected by changes in the archipelago environment. In this way we illustrate how the model can be used as a useful tool to help public policy makers to explore the consequences of their decisions.",0,1,0.99495476,openalex

The author conducted a semi-comprehensive literature review directed at identifying the current state of knowledge related to the effects of feral pigs on island and mainland plant and animal communities. Also, the author describes the situation in California where feral pigs that were introduced in the late 1700s are now widespread due to hunting-related introductions and natural range extensions. Feral pigs on predator-free oceanic islands are a serious conservation problem because they attain high densities and have contributed to near-extinctions and extinctions of multiple endemic plants and vertebrates. In mainland ecosystems, however, feral pigs can have both positive and negative effects depending on the local circumstances. Rooting, for example, can have both positive and negative effects on growth and survival of some trees, soils and soil processes, and the distribution of native and exotic grasses. In general, however, the negative effects of rooting by feral pigs are amplified when population densities are high. Feral pigs may compete with native species for limited resources, but there are limited data relevant to this hypothesis. Based on observations of small amounts of animal matter in their diets, feral pigs eat terrestrial vertebrates and eggs of ground nesting birds, but the importance of predation by feral pigs on native vertebrates is poorly known. Feral pigs also may have important indirect effects in mainland ecosystems by providing a new prey base for native predators which may then increase. In areas of Europe with extant wolf (Canis lupus) populations, wild boar (Sus scrofa) are an important prey species which may be facilitating numerical and geographic recoveries of wolves. Because wild boar are important prey for endangered Amur tigers (Panthera tigris), they are considered important for recovering tiger populations. In Australia, feral pigs are potentially important prey for dingoes (Canis familiaris dingo); whereas, in the United States, endangered Florida panthers (Felis concolor coryi) consumed 23% to 59% feral pigs, and mountain lions (Felis concolor) in Texas and California consumed 5% to 38% feral pigs. Research needs for feral pigs include quantitatively assessing: 1) how acorn foraging by feral pigs limits or influences regeneration of oaks (Quercus sp.); 2) the competitive effects of feral pigs on native species; 3) whether direct predation by feral pigs suppresses small vertebrate populations; and 4) how the availability of feral pigs as prey influences native predator populations.",0,1,0.99314207,openalex

The large number of new Muelleria taxa on the (sub)-Antarctic locations is not surprising. Species in Muelleria occur rarely in collections; in many habitats, it is unusual to find more than 1–2 valves in any slide preparation. As a result, records are scarce. The practice of ""force-fitting"" (shoehorning) specimens into descriptions from common taxonomic keys (and species drift) results in European species, such as M. gibbula and M. linearis, being applied to Antarctic forms in ecological studies. Finally, the typical terrestrial habitats of soils, mosses and ephemeral water bodies of most of these taxa have been poorly studied in the past.",0,1,0.9921475,openalex

Little is known about the C, N and P stoichiometric ratios that exist in the soils and plants of Chenier Island in the Yellow River Delta (YRD). We examined the distribution patterns and relationships of C, N and P stoichiometry in the soils and plants of Chenier Island, as well as the potential influences of the island's micro-geomorphology. Based on a study of four soil profile categories and Phragmites australis and Suaeda heteroptera plant tissues, our results showed that micro-geomorphology could leave a distinct imprint on the soil and plant elemental stoichiometry of Chenier Island; significant variation in the atomic C:N:P ratios (RCNP) existed in soils and plants, indicating that the RCNP values in both the soil and plants are not well constrained at the Chenier Island scale. RCN and RCP in Chenier Island soils were high, whereas the RNP values were comparatively low, indicating that the ecosystems of Chenier Island are nutrient-limited by N and P. However, the RNP values in P. australis and S. heteroptera plant tissues were high, suggesting that the plants of Chenier Island are nutrient-limited by P. Finally, we suggest that soil and plant N:P ratios may be good indicators of the soil and plant nutrient status during soil development and plant growth, which could be a useful reference for restoring the degraded soils of Chenier Island.",0,1,0.99128526,openalex

Battery energy storage systems provide power during peak times, alleviating grid stress and reducing the necessity for grid upgrades. By 2030, one of the proposed capacity development scenarios on the island involves deploying large-scale lithium-ion batteries to better manage the integration of solar generation. This paper focuses on the life cycle assessment and life cycle costing of a lithium iron phosphate large-scale battery energy storage system in Lombok to evaluate the environmental and economic impacts of this battery development scenario. This analysis considers a cradle-to-grave model and defines 10 environmental and 4 economic midpoint indicators to assess the impact of battery energy storage system integration with Lombok’s grid across manufacturing, operation, and recycling processes. From a life cycle assessment perspective, the operation subsystem contributes most significantly to global warming, while battery manufacturing is responsible for acidification, photochemical ozone formation, human toxicity, and impacts on marine and terrestrial ecosystems. Recycling processes notably affect freshwater due to their release of 4.69 × 10−4 kg of lithium. The life cycle costing results indicate that over 85% of total costs are associated with annualized capital costs at a 5% discount rate. The levelized cost of lithium iron phosphate batteries for Lombok is approximately 0.0066, demonstrating that lithium-ion batteries are an economically viable option for Lombok’s 2030 capacity development scenario. A sensitivity analysis of input data and electricity price fluctuations confirms the reliability of our results within a 20% margin of error. Moreover, increasing electricity prices for battery energy storage systems in Lombok can reduce the payback period to 3.5 years.",0,1,0.9944733,openalex

Collected data were used for model-based abundance estimates of fin whales in 2 strata. The minimum average (± SE) density of fin whales was estimated at 0.0268 ± 0.0183 ind. km-2 in a 19750 km2 area around Elephant Island, resulting in a minimum abundance estimate of 528 ± 362 fin whales. In a 13550 km2 area around the South Orkney Islands, we estimated a minimum density of 0.0588 ± 0.0381 ind. km-2 and a minimum abundance of 796 ± 516 ind. The results of this study confirm a westerly extension of a recently described high-density area for fin whales in the West Antarctic Peninsula region. In the light of increasing krill fisheries in the local region, we suggest this area for further studies to assess the potential for conflict between recovering whale populations and emerging industrial interests.

Four of them are extirpated and one is extinct. Of the 86 remaining species 51 are terrestrial (46 native, 5 introduced). The terrestrial mammals include 9 species of Insectivora, 6 (+ one tentative) of Chiroptera, one Primate, 12 Carnivora, 1 Perrissodactyla, 3 Artiodactyla, 19 Rodentia and 1 Lagomorpha. Native species include Boreal, Transition Zone and Austral elements, the result of Nova Scotia’s mid-latitude position on the continental coast.The 32 recorded marine species include 6 Carnivora (5 seals, walrus) and 26 Cetacea: Delphinidae (10 species), Phocoenidae (1), Monodontidae (1), Kogiidae (2), Physeteridae (1), Ziphiidae (4), Eschrichtiidae (1, extirpated), Balaenopteridae (5) and Balaenidae (1).Since 1971 four small mammal species (Sorex gaspensis, S. dispar, Glaucomys volans and Microtus chrotorrhinus) have been added to the provincial fauna, as a result of the first systematic and intensive sampling ever done in Nova Scotia. All are disjunct and three of them are restricted to forested talus habitats in the Cobequid Mts. or the Cape Breton Highlands. With the two disjunct species already known (Sorex arcticus maritimensis and Peromyscus leucopus caudatus), there are 6 disjunct mammals in the province, comprising 14.3 % of native non-volant terrestrial mammals, 33 % of insectivores and 18.8 % of native rodents. Two of them (Sorex gaspensis and Microtus chrotorrhinus) occur only on Cape Breton Island. No other area of similar size north of Mexico has a comparable proportion of disjunct mammals.Cape Breton Island historically has had a depauperate mammal fauna, lacking 8 species that were present on the adjacent mainland. The building of the connecting Canso Causeway in 1953-55 had a major zoogeographic impact, as it caused the western third of the strait to freeze over in winter and allowed the invasion and establishment of four large mammal species (Canis latrans, Procyon lotor, Mephitis mephitis and Lynx rufus).Le document présente l’information la plus récente sur la taxonomie, la répartition, l’habitat et la situation de 91 espèces de mammifères marins et terrestres qui vivent actuellement ou ont déjà vécu en Nouvelle-Écosse. Quatre d’entre elles ont disparu et une est éteinte. Sur les 86 autres espèces, 51 sont terrestres (46 espèces indigènes et 5 espèces introduites). Les mammifères terrestres comprennent 9 Insectivora, 6 (+ une espèce provisoire) Chiroptera, un Primate, 12 Carnivora, un Perrissodactyla, 3 Artiodactyla, 19 Rodentia et un Lagomorpha. La Nouvelle-Écosse étant située à une latitude moyenne sur la côte continentale, les espèces indigènes qui y vivent sont des éléments de la zone boréale, de la zone de transition et de la zone australe.Parmi les 32 espèces marines signalées, on compte 6 Carnivora important a (5 phoques et le morse) et 26 Cetacea: Delphinidae (10 espèces), Phocoenidae (1), Monodontidae (1), Kogiidae (2), Physeteridae (1), Ziphiidae (4), Eschrichtiidae (1, disparue), Balaenopteridae (5) et Balaenidae (1).Depuis 1971, à la suite du premier échantillonnage systématique et intensif mené en Nouvelle-Écosse, quatre espèces de petits mammifères (Sorex gaspensis, S. dispar, Glaucomys volans et Microtus chrotorrhinus) se sont ajoutées aux espèces fauniques de la province. Ce sont toutes des espèces disjointes, et trois d’entre elles sont confinées aux talus d’éboulis boisés des monts Cobequid ou des hautes-terres du Cap-Breton. Si on inclut les deux espèces disjointes déjà connues (Sorex arcticus maritimensis et Peromyscus leucopus caudatus), il existe 6 espèces disjointes de mammifères dans la province, qui représentent 14,3 % des mammifères terrestres indigènes qui ne volent pas, 33 % des Insectivores et 18,8 % des Rongeurs indigènes. Deux d’entre elles (Sorex gaspensis et Microtus chrotorrhinus) ne sont présentes que dans l’île du Cap-Breton. Au nord du Mexique, aucune autre région de taille semblable n’a une telle proportion d’espèces disjointes de mammifères.Dans le passé, l’île du Cap-Breton renfermait relativement peu de mammifères : on y trouvait 8 espèces de moins que dans la partie continentale de la Nouvelle-Écosse. La construction de la levée de Canso en 1953-1955 a eu un impact important zoogéographique du fait que, depuis, le tiers ouest du détroit gèle durant l’hiver, ce qui a permis à quatre espèces de gros mammifères (Canis latrans, Procyon lotor, Mephitis mephitis et Lynx rufus) de gagner l’île et de s’y établir.",0,1,0.99408853,openalex

They include Bipalium kewense and Dolichoplana striata that are largely restricted to hothouses and may be regarded as non-invasive species. In addition there are species from the southern hemisphere such as the invasive New Zealand flatworm Arthurdendyus triangulatus in the United Kingdom, Eire and the Faroe Islands, the Australian flatworm Australoplana sanguinea alba in Eire and the United Kingdom, and the Australian Blue Garden flatworm Caenoplana coerulea in France, Menorca and the United Kingdom. The United Kingdom has some twelve or more non-indigenous species most of which are Australian and New Zealand species. These species may move to an invasive stage when optimum environmental and other conditions occur, and the flatworms then have the potential to cause economic or environmental harm. In this paper, we report the identification (from morphology and molecular analysis of COI sequences) of non-indigenous terrestrial flatworms found in a hothouse in Caen (France) as the New Guinea flatworm Platydemus manokwari de Beauchamp, 1963 (Platyhelminthes, Continenticola, Geoplanidae, Rhynchodeminae). Platydemus manokwari is among the ""100 World's Worst Invader Alien Species"". Lists of World geographic records, prey in the field and prey in laboratories of P. manokwari are provided. This species is considered a threat to native snails wherever it is introduced. The recent discovery of P. manokwari in France represents a significant extension of distribution of this Invasive Alien Species from the Indo-Pacific region to Europe. If it escaped the hothouse, the flatworm might survive winters and become established in temperate countries. The existence of this species in France requires an early warning of this incursion to State and European Union authorities, followed by the eradication of the flatworm in its locality, tightening of internal quarantine measures to prevent further spread of the flatworm to and from this site, identifying if possible the likely primary source of the flatworm, and tracing other possible incursions that may have resulted from accidental dispersal of plants and soil from the site.",0,1,0.9935627,openalex

Location: The Galapagos archipelago is located 1000 km off the western coast of Ecuador. It is formed by 13 large islands (greater than 10 km 2), six smaller islands and over 40 islets that have official names. Other small rocks and islets remain unnamed. The archipelago straddles the equator at the 90th meridian west. Methods: Lists of the living reptilian, land bird species and genera and Scalesia land plant species were compiled from various published and online works. Parsimony Analysis of Endemicity (PAE) was used to find the most parsimonious cladograms depicting the biogeographic relationships of Galapagos to the American continents and the intra-archipelago ones. Analyses of species richness vs. island extents, species sharing vs. distance between islands, and species sharing vs. island extents were performed to assess the distribution patterns of the analysed vertebrates. Results: Genus distribution-based PAE results suggest that Galapagos archipelago was settled by South American reptiles. The Galapagos islands cluster with Ecuador, Chile and Peru. A large American clade including Meso-America, USA, Mexico and Colombia is supported by this work too. Sister group relationships between the Galapagos-western South American clade and the large American clade are not defined. Species distribution-based PAE results are not able to place the Galapagos into any clade. PAE intraarchipelago output shows that large islands cluster together, very small islands are placed with lesser confidence because of ecological noise explained by the analyses of species richness vs. extent, shared species vs. distance between islands, and shared species vs. extent relationships. This distribution-based work supports previously published phylogeny-based biogeographic analyses and corroborates them with an independent evidence.

Despite being an evidence-based discipline, to date there has been no comprehensive review of the outcomes of systematic conservation plans and assessments of the relative effectiveness of applications in different contexts. To address this fundamental gap in knowledge, our primary research question was: what is the extent, distribution and robustness of evidence on conservation outcomes of systematic conservation planning around the globe? Methods A systematic mapping exercise was undertaken using standardised search terms across 29 sources, including publication databases, online repositories and a wide range of grey literature sources. The review team screened articles recursively, first by title only, then abstract and finally by full-text, using inclusion criteria related to systematic conservation plans conducted at sub-global scales and reported on since 1983. We sought studies that reported outcomes relating to natural, human, social, financial or institutional outcomes and which employed robust evaluation study designs. The following information was extracted from included studies: bibliographic details, background information including location of study and broad objectives of the plan, study design, reported outcomes and context. Results Of the approximately 10,000 unique articles returned through our searches, 1209 were included for full-text screening and 43 studies reported outcomes of conservation planning interventions. However, only three studies involved the use of evaluation study designs which are suitably rigorous for inclusion, according to best-practice guidelines. The three included studies were undertaken in the Gulf of California (Mexico), Réunion Island, and The Nature Conservancy’s landholdings across the USA. The studies varied widely in context, purpose and outcomes. Study designs were non-experimental or qualitative, and involved use of spatial landholdings over time, stakeholder surveys and modelling of alternative planning scenarios. Conclusion Rigorous evaluations of systematic conservation plans are currently not published in academic journals or made publicly available elsewhere. Despite frequent claims relating to positive implications and outcomes of these planning activities, we show that evaluations are probably rarely conducted. This finding does not imply systematic conservation planning is not effective but highlights a significant gap in our understanding of how, when and why it may or may not be effective. Our results also corroborate claims that the literature on systematic conservation planning is dominated by methodological studies, rather than those that focus on implementation and outcomes, and support the case that this is a problematic imbalance in the literature. We emphasise the need for academics and practitioners to publish the outcomes of systematic conservation planning exercises and to consider employing robust evaluation methodologies when reporting project outcomes. Adequate reporting of outcomes will in turn enable transparency and accountability between institutions and funding bodies as well as improving the science and practice of conservation planning.",0,1,0.8906916,openalex

However, pure covers are hard to obtain without substantial management, and mixed covers—wherein some spontaneous species coexist with sown cover crops—seem to be a good alternative. Greater insight into factors influencing the composition and density of the spontaneous plant community is needed to achieve relatively good control of the performances of this mixed cover. Here we addressed two questions: 1) How does the functional structure of communities with a highly competitive sown cover crop and/or high initial species diversity differ from the functional structure of communities with the opposite characteristics? 2) Can aboveground species traits explain interactions between cover crops and spontaneous species present in the same community? In a fallowed field in Guadeloupe (West French Indies), we studied communities composed of one sown cover crop species and spontaneous species growing simultaneously in the plot. The study was conducted along two unrelated experimentally-devised gradients resulting from cropping practices: a competitivity gradient of a sown cover crop species and an initial species diversity gradient resulting from an initial soil perturbation induced by the false seedbed technique. These factors (soil tillage modality before cover crop sowing and cover crop species identity) were combined in a split-plot design. Seven and twelve months after cover crop sowing, community species densities and biomasses were assessed. Leaf trait values of the 12 most present species were measured at flowering to describe the functional structure of the community using the community weighted trait means and variances, and a functional diversity index. Our results showed high functional divergence in communities with highly competitive cover crops, which suggests differentiation of functional niches between species, but no clear differences in communities with high and low initial species diversity. We also showed that the studied species were positioned along a gradient from acquisitive to conservative strategies of resource capture and use according to their leaf trait values, regardless of their type (cover crops or spontaneous species), and that cover crop species had higher trait values related to size than spontaneous species. Finally, we demonstrated that interactions between cover crops and spontaneous species could be better explained by the cover crop dynamic height or community biomasses than by the measured aboveground functional traits and that the plant growth habit had a central role. This study shed light on interactions between sown cover crops and spontaneous species, which are pivotal to the design of diversified cropping systems. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.",0,1,0.84545296,negatives

We investigated the fauna of 8 historical shipwrecks off the US east coast to assess whether species distribution patterns on the shipwrecks fit models from classical island theory. Invertebrates on the shipwrecks included both sessile (sponges, anemones, hydroids) and motile (crustaceans, echinoderms) species. Invertebrate communities were significantly different among wrecks. The size and distance between wrecks influenced the biotic communities, much like on terrestrial islands. However, while wreck size influenced species richness (alpha diversity), distance to the nearest wreck influenced community composition (beta diversity). Alpha and beta diversity on the shipwrecks were thus influenced by different abiotic factors. We found no evidence of either nested patterns or non-random co-occurrence of morphotypes, suggesting that the taxa on a given shipwreck were randomly selected from the available taxon pool. Species present on the shipwrecks generally had 1 of 2 reproductive modes: most motile or solitary sessile species had long-duration planktotrophic larvae, while most encrusting or colonial sessile species had short-duration lecithotrophic larvae and underwent asexual reproduction by budding as adults. Short-duration larvae may recruit to their natal shipwreck, allowing them to build up dense populations and dominate the wreck surfaces. A high degree of dominance was indeed observed on the wrecks, with up to 80% of the fauna being accounted for by the most common species alone. By comparing the shipwreck communities to known patterns of succession in shallow water, we hypothesize that the shipwrecks are in a stage of mid-succession.

Despite global efforts to address this challenge, the documented number of alien species is rapidly increasing worldwide. However, the magnitude of the impact of alien species may vary significantly across habitats. For example, some habitats are naturally less prone to biological invasions due to stringent abiotic and biotic characteristics, selecting for a limited number of introduced species possessing traits closely related to the native organisms. Subterranean ecosystems are quintessential examples of habitats with strong environmental filters (e.g. lack of light and scarcity of food), driving convergent adaptations in species that have successfully adapted to life in darkness. Despite these stringent environmental constraints, the number of records of alien species in subterranean ecosystems has increased in recent decades, but the relevant literature remains largely fragmented and mostly anecdotal. Therefore, even though caves are generally considered very fragile ecosystems, their susceptibility to impacts by alien species remains untested other than for some very specific cases. We provide the first systematic literature survey to synthesise available knowledge on alien species in subterranean ecosystems globally. This review is supported by a database summarising the available literature, aiming to identify gaps in the distribution and spread of alien invertebrate species in subterranean habitats, and laying the foundations for future management practices and interventions. First, we quantitatively assessed the current knowledge of alien species in subterranean ecosystems to shed light on broader questions about taxonomic biases, geographical patterns, modes of dispersal, pathways for introductions and potential impacts. Secondly, we collected species-specific traits for each recorded alien species and tested whether subterranean habitats act as ecological filters for their establishment, favouring organisms with pre-adaptive traits suitable for subterranean life. We found information on the presence of 246 subterranean alien species belonging to 18 different classes. The dominant alien species were invertebrates, especially insects and arachnids. Most species were reported in terrestrial subterranean habitats from all continents except Antarctica. Palaearctic and Nearctic biogeographic regions represented the main source of alien species. The main routes of introductions into the recipient country are linked to commercial activities (84.3% of cases for which there was information available). Negative impacts have been documented for a small number of case studies (22.7%), mostly related to increased competition with native species. For a limited number of case studies (6.1%), management strategies were reported but the effectiveness of these interventions has rarely been quantified. Accordingly, information on costs is very limited. Approximately half of the species in our database can be considered established in subterranean habitats. According to our results, the presence of suitable traits grants access to the stringent environmental filter posed by subterranean environments, facilitating establishment in the new habitat. We recommend that future studies deepen the understanding of invasiveness into subterranean habitats, raising public and scientific community awareness of preserving these fragile ecosystems.",0,1,0.9483886,negatives

Here, we explore an extension of that concept to biological invasions. We compare biogeographical patterns in native and non-native beetle (Coleoptera) assemblages from around the world to test whether beetle invasions represent a random sample of species or whether some families are more prone to invade than others. Location: Global. Methods: Numbers of non-native beetle species established in ten regions worldwide were compared with the land area of each region. The distribution of species among families was compared with the distribution among families for all species native to the same region and with the distribution among families for the global pool of all known beetle species. Ordination analysis was used to characterize differences among native and non-native assemblages based upon the distribution of species among families. Results: We report a total of 1,967 non-native beetle species across all ten regions, and a classic log–log relationship between numbers of species per region and land area though relationships are generally stronger for native assemblages. Some families (e.g., Dermestidae and Bostrichidae) are over-represented and others (e.g., Carabidae, Scarabaeidae and Buprestidae) are under-represented in non-native assemblages. The distribution of species among families is generally similar among native assemblages with greatest similarities among nearby regions. In contrast, non-native species assemblages are more similar to each other than to native species assemblages. Main conclusions: Certain families are over-represented, and others are under-represented in non-native beetle assemblages compared to native assemblages, indicating “invasion disharmony” in the global representation of beetle families. Similarities in composition among non-native assemblages may reflect unobserved associations with invasion pathways and life-history traits that shape invasion success of different insect groups. © 2021 Her Majesty the Queen in Right of Canada.

The most abundant elements generally have the largest numbers of mineral species, as modeled by relationships for Earth's upper continental crust (E) and the Moon (M), respectively: Log(NE) = 0:22 Log(CE) + 1:70 (R2 = 0:34)(4861 minerals; 72 elements) Log(NM) = 0:19 Log(CM) + 0:23 (R2 = 0:68)(63 minerals; 24 elements); where C is an element's abundance in ppm and N is the number of mineral species in which that element is essential. Several elements that plot significantly below the trend for Earth's upper continental crust (e.g., Ga, Hf, and Rb) mimic other more abundant elements and thus are less likely to form their own species. Other elements (e.g., Ag, As, Cu, Pb, S, and U) plot significantly above the trend, which we attribute to their unique crystal chemical affinities, multiple coordination and oxidation states, their extreme concentration in some ore-forming fluids, and/or frequent occurrence with a variety of other rare elements-all factors that increase the diversity of mineral species incorporating these elements. The corresponding diagram for the Moon shows a tighter fit, most likely because none of these elements, except Cu and S, are essential constituents in lunar minerals. Given the similar slopes for Earth and the Moon, we suggest that the increase in mineral diversity with element abundance is a deterministic aspect of planetary mineral diversity. Though based on a limited number of collecting sites, the Moon's observed mineralogical diversity could be close to the minimum for a rocky planet or moon comparable in size - A baseline against which diversity of other terrestrial planets and moons having radii in the same range as Earth and its Moon can be measured. Mineral-forming processes on the Moon are limited to igneous activity, meteor impacts, and the solar wind-processes that could affect any planet or moon. By contrast, other terrestrial planets and moons have been subjected to more varied physical, chemical, and (in the case of Earth) biological processes that can increase mineral diversity in both deterministic and stochastic ways. Total mineral diversity for different elements is not appreciably influenced by the relative stabilities of individual phases, e.g., the broad pressure-temperature-composition stability ranges of cinnabar (HgS) and zircon (ZrSiO4) do not significantly diminish the diversity of Hg or Zr minerals. Moreover, the significant expansion of near-surface redox conditions on Earth through the evolution of microbial oxygenic photosynthesis tripled the available composition space of Earth's near-surface environment, and resulted in a corresponding tripling of mineral diversity subsequent to atmospheric oxidation. Of 4933 approved mineral species, 34% are known from only one or two localities, and more than half are known from five or fewer localities. Statistical analysis of this frequency distribution suggests that thousands of other plausible rare mineral species await discovery or could have occurred at some point in Earth's history, only to be subsequently lost by burial, erosion, or subduction-i.e., much of Earth's mineral diversity associated with rare species results from stochastic processes. Measurements of stellar stoichiometry reveal that stars can differ significantly from the Sun in relative abundances of rock-forming elements, which implies that bulk compositions of some extrasolar Earth-like planets likely differ significantly from those of Earth, particularly if the fractionation processes in evolving stellar nebulas and planetary differentiation are factored in. Comparison of Earth's upper continental crust and the Moon shows that differences in element ratios are reflected in ratios of mineral species containing these elements. In summary, although deterministic factors control the distribution of the most common rock-forming minerals in Earth's upper continental crust and on the Moon, stochastic processes play a significant role in the diversity of less common minerals. Were Earth's history to be replayed, and thousands of mineral species discovered and characterized anew, it is probable that many of those minerals would differ from species known today.",0,1,0.79751855,negatives

Temporal patterns of endemic and widespread species descriptions in the European fauna,"Aim To analyse if the historical species description process in 10 animal groups differed among widespread and endemic species and to evaluate whether our current knowledge about the diversity of these groups is complete. Location Sixty-nine terrestrial regions (countries, large islands, archipelagos) covering all of Europe. Methods Based on data from the Fauna Europaea project, we reconstructed the description histories of four vertebrate groups (amphibians, fish, mammals, reptiles) and six well-studied invertebrate groups (butterflies, grasshoppers, ground beetles, snails, spiders, true bugs) living in terrestrial and freshwater environments. We used accelerated failure time models to test for a possible delay of endemic species detection and to provide conservative estimates of the as yet undescribed proportions of the existing diversity. Results Our data set includes 24,092 species, of which 7202 (30%) are endemic to one Fauna Europaea region. Species descriptions over time follow different trajectories for endemic and widespread species, with endemic species being described 79 years later than widespread ones, on average. Rates of widespread species descriptions have been low throughout the 20th century despite increasing numbers of active taxonomists, and models indicate that only a minor fraction of extant species is unknown (0.43%). By contrast, endemic species accumulation curves do not seem to have levelled off yet. Conservative model predictions suggest that up to 19% of the existing endemic diversity still awaits description in some taxonomic groups. Conclusions Our results suggest that even for well-studied groups in the world's biogeographically best-known continent, scientific knowledge of species richness is far from complete and is biased towards widespread species. Research and conservation priorities may thus be misdirected, as, for example, regions with high numbers of as yet unrecognized endemics may not be adequately considered when setting conservation priorities. This is particularly problematic as their mostly small populations make endemic species especially vulnerable to human-induced pressures.",0,1,0.99632686,negatives

Isolation by the circumpolar Southern Ocean restricts propagules to three main groups: 1) those capable of prolonged survival in the air, 2) those carried by animal vectors, especially Man, and 3) those of marine origin. Diverse ice-free areas available for colonization include: isolated islands with receding ice sheets (e.g., Signy Island), maritime geothermal areas (e.g., Deception Island), and high altitude gcothermal areas on continental volcanoes (e.g., Mt. Erebus). Propagule abundance and diversity are low in Antarctica. Chance affects colonization success because the potential and viability of a propagule must match a favourable habitat for settlement, with adequate time for establishment before conditions become unfavourable. Aerobiological studies of the whole Antarctic region require international co-operation. The Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research (SCAR) Biological Investigations of Terrestrial Antarctic Systems (BIOTAS) research network has identified aerobiology as a major component of its International Research Programme. Aerobiology will be ground-, ship- and aircraft-based. To meet the requirements of an intrinsically sparse, diverse Antarctic aerobiota, the British Antarctic Survey is developing a new particle sampler for remote field use.",0,1,0.7685546,openalex

Across the Amazon Basin, forest-dwelling non-volant mammals play crucial roles in maintaining the integrity of forest functionality, yet have been poorly studied in fluvial island forests. Mammal assemblages may be affected by edaphic characteristics that operate indirectly via food nutritional quality, by patch attributes, and/or can be modulated by anthropogenic disturbances. Here, we conducted systematic and quantitative mammal surveys across fluvial islands of an Amazonian archipelago, to assess the influence of edaphic factors (soil fertility), island attributes (island area and degree of isolation) and anthropogenic characteristics (distance from human settlement and logging) on the patterns of mammal species composition and richness. On 28 islands, we conducted spoor surveys and deployed 49 camera traps (total effort of 2940 camera trap-days). Subsequently, we performed multiple regression analysis to investigate the influence of environmental and anthropogenic predictors on mammal species richness, while dbRDA (distance-based redundancy analysis) was used for species composition. We found that mammal species richness was positively correlated with soil fertility, and in combination with anthropogenic characteristics, both variables affected the species assemblage composition. In particular, smaller species were found across a variety of levels of soil fertility and anthropogenic disturbances, while larger mammals were mostly recorded at sites with higher soil fertility and low levels of anthropogenic disturbances. Understanding the contribution of environmental and anthropogenic characteristics to the observed mammalian species richness and assemblage composition patterns will help optimise management and conservation efforts on Amazonian fluvial islands. In particular, we suggest enforcing hunting and logging restrictions within fluvial islands through surveillance activities, especially in more fertile islands. © 2021 Ecological Society of Australia",0,1,0.9939545,negatives

Inherent characteristics of island species and ecosystems (e.g. small population sizes, low habitat availability, isolated evolution, low functional redundancy) cause a particular vulnerability. Strong local anthropogenic pressures interact with climate change impacts and increase threats. Owing to the high degree of endemism in their floras, a disproportionally high potential for global biodiversity loss originates from climate change impacts on oceanic islands, We reviewed a growing body of research, finding evidence of emerging climate change influences as well as high potentials of future impacts on insular species and ecosystems. Threats from global climate change are not evenly distributed among the world's oceanic islands but rather vary with intrinsic (e.g. island area, structure, age and ecological complexity) and extrinsic factors (regional character, magnitude and rate of climatic alterations, local human influences). The greatest flora vulnerabilities to climate change impacts can be expected on islands of small area, low elevation and homogeneous topography. Islands of low functional redundancies will particularly suffer from high rates of co-modifications and co-extinctions due to climate-change-driven disruptions of ecological interactions. High threat potentials come from synergistic interactions between different factors, especially between climatic changes and local anthropogenic encroachments on native species and ecosystems. In addition, human responses to climate change can cause strong indirect impacts on island floras, making highly populated islands very vulnerable to secondary (derivative) effects. We provide an integrated overview of climate change-driven processes affecting oceanic island plants and depict knowledge gaps and uncertainties. The suitability of oceanic islands and their ecosystems for potential research on the field of climate change ecology is highlighted and implications for adequate research approaches are given.

This is a common trend in cultural landscapes around the world. Cultural landscapes have great social-ecological significance, including cultural safeguarding and renewal, as well as maintenance of biodiversity, ecosystem functions and services, making them objects of special attention in conservation and restoration efforts. This study investigates the relationship between the Lekwungen people and heavily altered ecosystems in the context of ecological restoration for the cultural landscapes of Tl'chés. In order to thoroughly explore the ecological, social and cultural aspects and processes involved in the restoration of Tl'chés, this study combined different environmental sciences methodologies, including historical and archival research, semi-structured interviews and participatory observation with Lekwungen participants, as well as ecological field assessments and an innovative mapping approach termed Terrestrial Cultural Ecosystem Mapping (TCEM). This study generated historical and spatial references for ecosystem and land use change in West Chatham Island, as well as cultural and ecological understandings to support restoration. Although important native species such as Camassia spp. are still thriving, present-day ecosystems on this island are heavily altered from the natural Garry oak ecosystem reference sites and are largely dominated by exotic invasive shrubs and graminoid species. This investigation indicates that the Lekwungen value both the historical ecological conditions of the island and particular types of the present-day novel or hybrid ecological states, such as the overgrown heritage orchard and nonnative berries found on the islands. Present-day ecosystems of Tl'chés are a result of a hybrid management system (traditional and conventional), coupled with land abandonment for many decades. Restoration of Tl'chés must involve both ecological and cultural components. Therefore, intervention strategies should consider the incorporation of novel and hybrid ecosystems (i.e. naturalized exotic species) into a restoration plan for ecological, cultural, historical, and subsistence values.",0,1,0.9922637,openalex

Owing to its voracious appetite, wide environmental adaptability, high growth rate, and reproductive capacity, it has become an invasive species across the world, mainly in Southeast Asia, Japan, the western Pacific islands, and China. This pest can damage agricultural crops and is an intermediate host of many parasites that can threaten human health. However, genomic information of A. fulica remains limited, hindering genetic and genomic studies for invasion control and management of the species. Findings Using a k-mer–based method, we estimated the A. fulica genome size to be 2.12 Gb, with a high repeat content up to 71%. Roughly 101.6 Gb genomic long-read data of A. fulica were generated from the Pacific Biosciences sequencing platform and assembled to produce a first A. fulica genome of 1.85 Gb with a contig N50 length of 726 kb. Using contact information from the Hi-C sequencing data, we successfully anchored 99.32% contig sequences into 31 chromosomes, leading to the final contig and scaffold N50 length of 721 kb and 59.6 Mb, respectively. The continuity, completeness, and accuracy were evaluated by genome comparison with other mollusk genomes, BUSCO assessment, and genomic read mapping. A total of 23,726 protein-coding genes were predicted from the assembled genome, among which 96.34% of the genes were functionally annotated. The phylogenetic analysis using whole-genome protein-coding genes revealed that A. fulica separated from a common ancestor with Biomphalaria glabrata ~182 million years ago. Conclusion To our knowledge, the A. fulica genome is the first terrestrial mollusk genome published to date. The chromosome sequence of A. fulica will provide the research community with a valuable resource for population genetics and environmental adaptation studies for the species, as well as investigations of the chromosome-level of evolution within mollusks.",0,1,0.99025375,openalex

Rachel Atkinson and colleagues review eradication as a tool for invasive species management in Galápagos. They report on the history of species introductions in Galápagos and show that the rate of introductions steadily increased since the 1830s, rising most rapidly during the last 50 years. In 2008, the tally of introduced terrestrial species was 1, 445 including 870 plants, 536 invertebrates, 30 vertebrates and ten diseases. Of these introduced species, many have invaded native ecosystems. Vertebrate invasions were the first to cause impact and alarm in the latter half of the twentieth century. These have been followed by plant and invertebrate invasions that now cover huge areas, particularly in the highland regions of the inhabited islands, and further invasions are expected in future. The authors encourage the reader to consider potentially positive and negative impacts of eradication programs to the whole ecosystem, not just iconic species. They consider four main criteria before deciding to attempt eradication: (1) strategic-operational; (2) biological; (3) economic; and (4) socio-political. They list the following important considerations: (1) an eradication operation should not be attempted if reintroduction cannot be prevented; (2) the rate of removal must exceed the rate of population increase; (3) species with limited distributions, that are easily detectable, with a short-lived dormant stage (e.g. a seed or egg bank), and that have a known control method for reproductive individuals, are prime candidates for eradication; (4) eradications, especially when carried out at the early stages of invasion, are cost-effective and theoretically neat solutions to prevent the future or current impact of invasive species. Additionally, eradications should not be started if there is insufficient funding to address unforeseen consequences of the operation on ecosystem dynamics. Another frequently overlooked requirement is the need for governmental and public support for all aspects of the project from the start in order to ensure that there are no barriers to the program from beginning to end. The tool of eradication is attractive to both donors and managers alike, as there is a measurable outcome and a definite endpoint to the project. However, there are limits to the use of eradication as a tool for conservation. The authors discuss these limits, analyzing 57 eradication projects of vertebrates, invertebrates and vascular plants from 1961 to present. Of these, 27 have been successful, 20 unsuccessful and ten are ongoing. The majority of successes were of large vertebrates, whereas most plant and invertebrate eradication attempts were unsuccessful. They found common trends in project successes and failures with operational, biological, economic and social criteria all contributing. They discuss the future of eradications and the alternatives in Galápagos. Matthias Wolff and coworkers use a trophic modeling approach to integrate ecological and fisheries data for a holistic description of the Galápagos Marine Reserve (GMR) ecosystem and to evaluate the effect of the banning of industrial fishing in the GMR in 1998 and the coinciding El Niño event. For the construction of their baseline flow model they used data from the late 1990s when industrial fishery was still in place. Estimated pre-1998 catch volumes in the GMR were in the realms of average catches in other oceanic and shelf systems, hence, the model was considered to be realistic. Top order predators were the warmblooded toothed whales, but large pelagic fish and cephalopods also played a prominent role. Simulations suggest that the GMR has undergone a substantial recovery process of large pelagic fish and sharks since industrial fishery was banned 12 years ago. According to the model simulations, most large pelagic fish would have - under normal environmental conditions - attained 10-20% stock increase after only two years after the fishery ban, concordant with literature findings showing that marine reserve closure is almost immediately effective in less than two years. Nevertheless, the El Niño event suppressed this rapid response for a further two to three years, suggesting that the bottom-up effect on the system of reduced primary productivity was stronger than the top-down effect from the release in fishing pressure. The first species predicted to surpass the pre-El Niño reference level was the yellowfin tuna, followed by wahoo, dolphin fish and sailfish. Owing to their slow population turnover rates, sharks followed later. Juvenile sharks are predicted to maintain reduced biomass throughout the time due to strong control by increased levels of top predators. Sea lions, cormorants, penguins and sea turtles needed the whole 12-year period to rebuild their populations. The authors emphasize that the disruption of the system by the El Niño impacted in the medium term (three to nine years), leading to higher biomasses of large pelagic fish predators than under the same fishery conditions without the El Niño impact. This suggests that, since predator biomass is reduced during the El Niño, prey populations find an “open loophole” to proliferate first and are then followed by their predators in a Lotka-Volterra fashion. It then takes several years for the system to normalize. Long-term monitoring data for marine mammals, birds and sea turtles confirmed the El Niño driven population reductions simulated by the model. Marjan van den Belt presents mediated modeling (MM) as a computer-based tool that can facilitate the participation of diverse stakeholders in the identification and valuation of ecosystem services from a conservation and human perspective. Systems thinking (the use of causal diagrams) and system dynamics (quantitative representations of feedback loops and time lags to understand systems) provide the underlying modeling philosophy. MM is presented as a decision support tool that can feed into all phases of adaptive management: envisioning; assessment; planning; implementation; and monitoring. The discussion between the stakeholders involved is interpreted by a mediated modeler and reflected back into the dialogue for all participants in real time. The integration of ecology, economics and social issues for sustainable development is often considered a normative objective in a MM process. In her contribution, Marjan uses a first pass example of how MM - based on a model produced using the STELLA software - could work in Galápagos to demonstrate how this tool could promote stakeholder dialogue. © 2012 selection and editorial material, Matthias Wolff and Mark Gardener; individual chapters, the contributors.",0,1,0.997997,negatives

This study aimed to survey the spatial–temporal land degradation patterns and explore its driving mechanism based on a geographical detector in Hainan Island from 2000 to 2020. First, the areas of forest, cultivated land, and construction land were analysed, and their mutation year was determined through the Mann-Kendall abrupt test. Then, change vector analysis was used to create a double-evaluation system by combining the normalized difference vegetation index and net primary productivity. Finally, the geographical detector was used to identify the driving mechanism of different land-use types. The results show that 2013 was the mutation year of the three land-use types. From 2000 to 2013 (Stage 1), the land degradation areas of forest, cultivated land, construction land, grassland, and unutilised land reached 1977.13, 613.25, 165.81, 261.06, and 4.25 km2, respectively. From 2013 to 2020 (Stage 2), the degraded land area accounted for only 0.91 % of the island's total area. From the single factor perspective, the elevation (DEM), least distance to residential area (LDP), and variety of mean annual temperature (VTem) were found to be the dominant factors of land degradation of cultivated land and grassland, forest, construction land in Stage 1. On the other hand, in Stage 2, the main factor of land degradation was the variety of the density of GDP (VGDP) in cultivated land, grassland, and construction land, while it was the variety of mean annual precipitation (VPre) in the forest. Moreover, all pair-factors provided a higher determinant power for degraded land areas than a single factor. From the interaction effect perspective in Stage 1, VPOP ∩ LDR (i.e. the variety of the density of population density and least distance to roads or railways), LDP ∩ LDR, and VTem ∩ LDR were the most significant pair-factors of the interaction effect on land degradation of cultivated land, forest and grassland, and construction land. In Stage 2, the most significant pair-factors of the interaction effect in different land-use types were DEM ∩ VPOP and VPre ∩ POP in degraded cultivated land, VPre ∩ DEM and VPre ∩ LDR in degraded forest land, DEM ∩ VTem in degraded grassland, and VGDP ∩ LDR in degraded construction land. Given the time-lag effects of factors and the attribution analysis of land degradation, we suggest limiting the construction of roads and residential areas, increasing biodiversity, and sheltering forests to protect terrestrial ecosystems in the future.",0,1,0.9970489,openalex

We studied the frequency of endozoochory by shorebirds in different parts of Europe covering a broad latitudinal range and different seasons. We assessed whether plants dispersed conformed to morphological dispersal syndromes. A total of 409 excreta samples (271 faeces and 138 pellets) were collected from redshank Tringa totanus , black‐winged stilt Himantopus himantopus , pied avocet Recurvirostra avosetta , northern lapwing Vanellus vanellus , Eurasian curlew Numenius arquata and black‐tailed godwit Limosa limosa in south‐west Spain, north‐west England, southern Ireland and Iceland in 2005 and 2016, and intact seeds were extracted and identified. Godwits were sampled just before or after migratory movements between England and Iceland. The germinability of seeds was tested. Intact diaspores were recovered from all bird species and study areas, and were present in 13% of samples overall. Thirteen plant families were represented, including Charophyceae and 26 angiosperm taxa. Only four species had an ‘endozoochory syndrome’. Four alien species were recorded. Ellenberg values classified three species as aquatic and 20 as terrestrial. Overall, 89% of seeds were from terrestrial plants, and 11% from aquatic plants. Average seed length was higher in redshank pellets than in their faeces. Six species were germinated, none of which had an endozoochory syndrome. Seeds were recorded during spring and autumn migration. Plant species recorded have broad latitudinal ranges consistent with LDD via shorebirds. Crucially, morphological syndromes do not adequately predict LDD potential, and more empirical work is required to identify which plants are dispersed by shorebirds.

 LocationNew Caledonia (SW Pacific).; MethodsWe re-analysed data from the New Caledonian Plant Inventory and Permanent Plot Network (NC-PIPPN). In this plot network, all trees (DBH5cm) were inventoried from 201 plots measuring 20x20m and located between 5 and 1292m a.s.l. We tested whether the number of trees inventoried in these plots affected the elevational richness pattern, and if so, whether plots with large trees have a low species density because of a low number of inventoried trees. This was done by applying individual-based and coverage-based rarefaction procedures with different cut-off threshold values and re-testing the relationship between estimated species richness and elevation.; ResultsAbout 40% of the variability in species density is explained by variation in the density of trees, which in turn had no obvious pattern with elevation. Plots with large trees (high quadratic mean DBH) contained fewer individuals and thus fewer species. Applying rarefaction changed the observed elevational pattern from a peak in species richness approximately in the middle of the studied elevational gradient to a peak at lower elevations. Both the choice of the rarefaction procedure and the cut-off threshold value used to estimate species richness may dramatically change the elevational pattern.; ConclusionsWhen the local species pool is large, the use of small plots relative to tree size induces a high correlation between species richness and the number of trees inventoried per plot. To analyse appropriately an elevational pattern for such small plot sizes, species richness should be rarefied to provide additional perspectives. We show that rarefaction changes the elevation at which species richness is expected to be maximal and that increasing the cut-off threshold value sharpens the observed humped pattern.",0,1,0.99840826,negatives

Location: Data were collected from 35 islands within Massasauga Provincial Park on the eastern shores of the Georgian Bay, Ontario, Canada. Methods: Sampled islands were located using stratified random selection based on location and size variation. The number of species was recorded along stratified random transects. Island isolation variables included distance to the mainland, distance to the nearest island, largest gap in a stepping-stone sequence, distance to the closest upwind point of land, and a landscape measure of island isolation. The landscape measure of isolation was quantified as the percentage of the land area within 100, 250, 500, 1000, 1500 and 2000 m of each island's perimeter. The isolation variables were calculated within a geographical information system (GIS). Dependent variables in the regression analyses included species richness, the logarithm of species richness and residuals of the species-area relationship. Independent variables included island isolation variables and their logarithmic transformations. Results: Isolation plays a role, albeit small, in explaining species richness in the study area. In the regression analyses, the landscape measure of isolation provided a better fit than conventional measures of island isolation. Islands with less land than water within a 250-m buffer were more effectively isolated and had fewer species present than islands surrounded by a greater proportion of water. Main conclusions: Consistent with the species-isolation relationship, fewer species were present on more isolated islands within the Massasauga study area, as elucidated using a series of island buffers in a GIS. Applying a landscape measure of isolation to similar dense, freshwater archipelagos may elucidate species-isolation patterns not evident through conventional, straight-line distance measurements of island isolation. The low value of the regression coefficients as well as the isolation history and high density of the Massasauga islands suggests caution in extending the results, especially to dissimilar archipelagos. © 2007 The Author.",0,1,0.86364096,negatives

Here, we examined the relationship between functional connectivity (gene flow) and structural connectivity (area and spatial configuration of habitats) in three co‐occurring short‐range plant taxa in an ancient terrestrial island system. Location Low‐altitude mountain range south‐western Australia. Methods We analysed spatial patterns of genetic differentiation at nuclear microsatellite loci using Bayesian clustering. Circuit theory modelling was used to generate all possible pathways that connect populations as resistance distance matrices based on two surfaces for each taxon. The first surface assumes a flat terrain and tests whether genetic similarity declines only with distance—isolation by distance (IBD). The second surface is habitat suitability based on species distribution modelling (SDM), which tests whether genetic similarity is a function of connected and suitable habitat. Multiple matrix regression with randomization was used to test the significance of the resistance distance matrices at predicting two metrics of genetic differentiation ( F ST and D EST ). Variance explained was partitioned using redundancy analysis. Results Genetic structure for the insect‐pollinated taxa— Acacia adinophylla— and Tetratheca aphylla subsp. aphylla was at similar spatial scales. Unexpectedly, a higher level of genetic structure was found in the wind‐pollinated Lepidosperma bungalbin . IBD best explained the gene flow of A. adinophylla ( R 2 = 0.41–0.43) with partial support provided by habitat suitability ( R 2 = 0.04–0.07). In contrast, connectivity by habitat suitability was highest for T. aphylla subsp. aphylla ( R 2 = 0.56–0.59). Drivers of L. bungalbin connectivity were inconsistent between the two measures of genetic differentiation. Main conclusions Gene flow is facilitated by different factors for the three taxa. Habitat fragmentation would most strongly impede gene flow for T. aphylla subsp. aphylla . Geographical distance cannot be assumed as the sole or best determinant of gene flow among populations, nor can findings be generalized to coexisting taxa.",0,1,0.4749648,openalex

Endemicity is generally highest in South Island and northern North Island and low in southern North Island. A prominent landscape feature that is partly correlated with this is Cook Strait, which separates the two main islands of New Zealand and marks the southern boundary of a region that interests biogeographers and geologists alike. This region encompasses a zone of intense tectonic strain related to the transfer of plate convergence via subduction into oblique-slip and strike-slip faulting. We review geological information and provide new palaeogeographic reconstructions of the area that depict changes in the distribution of mountains, the extent to which southern North Island was under the ocean, and the history of marine straits over the last 4 million years. This information is essential for the development of testable biogeographic hypotheses. We find that the Wellington region was formerly connected to the relatively mountainous Marlborough area, and more distant than today from the northern island of the time. Significant topography in the Kaimanawa Range is probably of Early Pliocene age. However, the Ruahine-Tararua ranges and Taranaki-Taupo volcanics have formed since c. 1 Ma.

Questions concerning the identities, geographical distributions and chronologies of foraging, herding and agricultural populations — often problematically equated with the chronological labels 'Later Stone Age (LSA)', 'Neolithic' and 'Iron Age' — are still unresolved. Previous studies at the site of Kuumbi Cave in the Zanzibar Archipelago of Tanzania reported late Pleistocene Middle Stone Age (MSA) and LSA, mid-Holocene Neolithic and late Holocene Iron Age occupations (Sinclair et al. Citation2006; Chami Citation2009). Kuumbi Cave considerably extends the chronology of human occupation on the eastern African coast and findings from the site have been the basis for the somewhat contentious identification of both a coastal Neolithic culture and early chicken, a domesticate that was introduced to Africa from Asia. The site therefore warrants further investigation. Here we report on a new excavation of the Kuumbi Cave sequence that has produced a suite of 20 radiocarbon and optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) dates. Our results suggest that the cave's stratigraphy is complex, reflecting taphonomic processes that present interpretive and dating challenges. Our assessment of the stratigraphic sequence demonstrates three phases of habitation, two of which reflect terminal Pleistocene occupation and are characterised by quartz microliths, bone points and the exploitation of terrestrial and marine species, and one of which reflects later reoccupation by AD 600. In this latter phase, Kuumbi Cave was inhabited by a population with a locally distinct material culture that included idiosyncratic Tana or Triangular Incised Ware ceramics and medium-sized limestone stone tools, but with a subsistence economy similar to that of the late Pleistocene, albeit with more emphasis on marine foods and smaller terrestrial mammals. Our results suggest that Kuumbi Cave may have been unoccupied for much of the Holocene, after Zanzibar became an island.

Although over 250 Lapita sites have been found throughout the Western Pacific, human remains associated with Lapita period sites are rare. The site of Teouma, on Efate Island, Vanuatu has yielded the largest burial assemblage (n = 68 inhumations) of Lapita period humans ever discovered, providing a unique opportunity for assessing human adaptation to the environment in a colonizing population. Stable isotope ratios (δ13C, δ15N, δ34S) of human bone collagen from forty-nine Teouma adults were analyzed against a comprehensive dietary baseline to assess the paleodiet of some of Vanuatu's earliest inhabitants. The isotopic dietary baseline included both modern plants and animals (n = 98) and prehistoric fauna from the site (n = 71). The human stable isotope data showed that dietary protein at Teouma included a mixture of reef fish and inshore organisms and a variety of higher trophic marine (e.g. marine turtle) and terrestrial animals (e.g. domestic animals and fruit bats). The domestic pigs and chickens at Teouma primarily ate food from a C3 terrestrial environment but their δ15N values indicated that they were eating foods from higher trophic levels than those of plants, such as insects or human fecal matter, suggesting that animal husbandry at the site may have included free range methods. The dietary interpretations for the humans suggest that broad-spectrum foraging and the consumption of domestic animals were the most important methods for procuring dietary protein at the site.

Especially for rare or threatened species, reliable population models should adequately incorporate demographic uncertainty. Here, we focus on an important form of demographic stochasticity: variation in litter sizes. We use terrestrial carnivores as an example taxon, as they are frequently threatened or of economic importance. Since data on intraspecific litter size variation are often sparse, it is unclear what probability distribution should be used to describe the pattern of litter size variation for multiparous carnivores. Methodology/Principal Findings We used litter size data on 32 terrestrial carnivore species to test the fit of 12 probability distributions. The influence of these distributions on quasi-extinction probabilities and the probability of successful disease control was then examined for three canid species – the island fox Urocyon littoralis, the red fox Vulpes vulpes, and the African wild dog Lycaon pictus. Best fitting probability distributions differed among the carnivores examined. However, the discretised normal distribution provided the best fit for the majority of species, because variation among litter-sizes was often small. Importantly, however, the outcomes of demographic models were generally robust to the distribution used. Conclusion/Significance These results provide reassurance for those using demographic modelling for the management of less studied carnivores in which litter size variation is estimated using data from species with similar reproductive attributes.",0,1,0.9497845,openalex

The Balbina Hydroelectric Dam of Central Brazilian Amazonia inundated 312,900 ha of primary forests and created approximately 3500 variable-sized islands that still harbor vertebrate populations after nearly 3 decades after isolation. We estimated the species richness, abundance, biomass, composition, and group size of medium- to large-bodied forest vertebrates in response to patch, landscape, and habitat-quality metrics across 37 islands and 3 continuous forest sites throughout the Balbina archipelago. We conducted 1168 km of diurnal censuses and had 12,420 camera-trapping days along 81 transects with 207 camera stations. We determined the number of individuals (or groups) detected per 10 km walked and the number of independent photographs per 10 camera-trapping days, respectively, for each species. We recorded 34 species, and patch area was the most significant predictor of vertebrate population relative abundance and aggregate biomass. The maximum group size of several group-living species was consistently larger on large islands and in continuous patches than on small islands. Most vertebrate populations were extirpated after inundation. Remaining populations are unlikely to survive further ecological disruptions. If all vertebrate species were once widely distributed before inundation, we estimated that approximately 75% of all individual vertebrates were lost from all 3546 islands and 7.4% of the animals in all persisting insular populations are highly likely to be extirpated. Our results demonstrate that population abundance estimates should be factored into predictions of community disassembly on small islands to robustly predict biodiversity outcomes. Given the rapidly escalating hydropower infrastructure projects in developing counties, we suggest that faunal abundance and biomass estimates be considered in environmental impact assessments and large strictly protected reserves be established to minimize detrimental effects of dams on biodiversity. Conserving large tracts of continuous forests represents the most critical conservation measure to ensure that animal populations can persist at natural densities in Amazonian forests. © 2020 The Authors.

() has become a widely accepted theoretical framework in island biogeography. In this study, we explore whether GDM predictions hold when overall plant diversity is deconstructed into major plant families. Location: 101 islands from 14 oceanic archipelagos world-wide. Methods: Occurrence data for all species of nine large, cosmopolitan flowering plant families were used to test predictions derived from the GDM. We analysed the effects of island area and age on species richness as well as number and percentage of single-island endemic species per family using mixed-effect models. Results: Total species and endemic richness as well as the percentage of endemic species showed the predicted hump-shaped relationship with island age. The overall pattern was mainly driven by few species-rich plant families. Varying patterns were found for individual families, some of them opposing the general trend. In most cases, native and endemic species richness peaked much earlier in the island life cycle than suggested by the GDM. The contribution of area to the explained variation of all dependent variables was much higher than that of island age. Main conclusions: The results suggest that biodiversity-age relationships reported for large taxonomic groups like plants are driven by only a few species-rich clades. The way these families influence the overall patterns of species richness and endemism is related to family-specific properties, such as evolutionary history or dispersal strategies. Deviances from the GDM predictions can hence largely be explained by family characteristics and considering taxon-specific traits may help to further improve the explanatory power of the GDM. Families not following the expectations, like Orchidaceae, may be particularly valuable candidates to unveil so far neglected drivers of island biogeographical patterns. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",0,1,0.99633634,negatives

Specifically non-silicate minerals may contribute significantly to the weathering derived fluxes from silicate-dominated lithological classes. The Japanese Archipelago consists of predominantly silicate-dominated lithologies with a high proportion of volcanics. However, the spatially explicit representation of chemical weathering rates remains difficult for such a large region, because many controlling factors on chemical weathering rates are correlated with each other. Due to the spatial heterogeneity of lithology, a multi-lithological model approach to estimate spatially explicit chemical weathering rates for unmonitored areas is applied here. To achieve this, hydrochemical data of 381 catchments are used to train a set of models, recognizing the contribution of a variety of proposed factors influencing chemical silicate rock weathering rates (CSRWR: cations plus dissolved silica flux). The monitored catchments cover ~ 44% of the Japanese Archipelago. Cation chemical weathering rates (excluding Si) are linearly correlated with CSRWR and show outliers if basic volcanics or pyroclastic flows are present due to increased silica release rates. Lithology and runoff are identified as the strongest predictors for chemical weathering rates. Temperature and gradient of slope are of less relevance for the regional scale prediction while further proposed factors like soil properties or land cover are not identified as major predictors. Latter findings are partly attributed to geodata quality, low variability of parameter values as well as spatial correlations of proposed controlling factors with lithology or runoff. The calculated average CSRWR of the Archipelago is ~ 25 t km−2 a− 1 and ranges from 5.9 to 107 t km−2 a− 1 in monitored catchments. Weathering rates per lithological class as a function of runoff can be grouped into three classes: a) pyroclastic flows showing the highest chemical weathering rates; b) alluvial deposits, mixed sediments and basic to intermediate volcanics with medium rates; and c) metamorphics, siliciclastic sediments, acid volcanics, acid plutonics and unconsolidated sediments (other than alluvial deposits), showing the lowest rates. The recognition of lithogenic sulfur would add 9.7% to CSRWR of considered catchments. Results suggest that the lithological classes acid volcanics and unconsolidated sediments contribute above average to the sulfur fluxes. Possible biases of this observation are discussed. The contribution of Ca-fluxes from non-silicate calcic minerals (named Ca-excess, Ca-fluxes in addition to silicate Ca-fluxes) is about 10% of the CSRWR on average and is attributed by a wide value range. The calculated ratio ""Ca-excess to total Ca-fluxes"" from chemical weathering averages around 62%, 75%, 56%, 83% and 84% for the lithological classes acid plutonics, metamorphics, siliciclastic sediments, mixed sediments and acid volcanics, respectively. This suggests a major Ca-contribution from non-silicate calcic minerals for these lithological classes. Phosphorus release from rocks due to chemical weathering is estimated to be between 1 kg P km−2 a− 1 and 390 kg P km−2 a− 1. The P-release patterns in dependence of runoff per lithological class are different from CSRWRs due to differences of applied P-content in rocks. The identified spatial P-release patterns suggest that the consideration of dynamic and spatially resolved P-release rates by chemical weathering might improve ecosystem studies. Later findings may be of importance for analysing the influence of P-release from rocks on the climate system via ecosystem functioning on geological time scales. A first application of the P-release model to the global scale suggests an annual release of 1.6 Mt P (13.8 kg P km−1 a− 1) by chemical weathering of silicate dominated lithological classes (excluding carbonate sedimentary rocks).",0,1,0.9805195,openalex

Location All extratropical areas (&gt;25° N and 25° S latitudes), excluding islands. Time period 2000–2018. Major taxa studied Amphibians, birds and mammals. Methods We mapped three global indices of winter conditions [number of days of frozen ground (length of frozen ground winter); snow cover variability; and lack of subnivium (below‐snow refuge)] from satellite data, then used generalized additive models to examine their relationships with species richness patterns derived from range data. Results Length of frozen ground winter was the strongest predictor of species richness, with a consistent cross‐taxonomic decline in species richness occurring beyond 3 months of winter. It also often outperformed other environmental predictors of species richness patterns commonly used in biodiversity studies, including climate variables, primary productivity and elevation. In areas with ≥3 months of winter conditions, all three winter indices explained much of the deviance in amphibian, mammal and resident bird species richness. Mammals exhibited a stronger relationship with snow cover variability and lack of subnivium than the other taxa. Species richness of fully migratory species of birds peaked at c . 5.5 months of winter, coinciding with low species richness of residents. Main conclusions Our study demonstrates that winter structures latitudinal and elevational gradients of extratropical terrestrial species richness. In a rapidly warming world, tracking the seasonal dynamics of frozen ground and snow cover will be essential for predicting the consequences of climate change on species, communities and ecosystems.

In this study, we used field surveys, ethnographic interviews, and daily counts in markets to document species of terrestrial wildlife on sale in North Sulawesi markets, and to identify the hunting sites, practices, and key actors within the wildlife trade. We quantify the volume of wild meat traded and their prices, with a particular focus on the flying fox trade. Wildlife meat was routinely available for sale in 73% of the markets and supermarkets surveyed in North Sulawesi. The wildlife taxa most commonly found in these markets were flying foxes, wild pigs, rats and snakes. Wildlife hunting and trade networks extend to all provinces of the island through a well-organized, dynamic and easy to access network involving many actors. We identified 45 flying fox roosts in Sulawesi, 38 of which were under active hunting pressure. A third of the active hunting sites are located in Southeast Sulawesi, which acts as a hub for bat hunting and trade. We estimate that the number of flying foxes annually traded in Sulawesi ranges from 662,551 to more than one million individuals and conclude that current rates of flying fox harvest are unstainable. Stricter law enforcement, implementation of hunting quotas, and further research efforts are therefore urgently needed to improve the sustainability of the wildlife trade in Sulawesi.",0,1,0.99579096,openalex

However, the effect of anthropogenic habitat modifications on the distribution of insular freshwater microcrustaceans is unknown. In the present paper, we examine the consequences of human activity on the insular diversity of microcrustaceans in the context of the theories of island biogeography and intermediate disturbances. The samples were collected in Madeira Island at 38 freshwater sampling sites with different anthropopressure. Morphology-based species identification of the copepods and cladocerans was supplemented with genetic analysis (COI) in some species. To estimate the species richness of the island, rarefaction, and extrapolation methods were used. Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA) was applied to assess the influence of geospatial and environmental variables on the species distribution. A total of 20 species belonging to six families were identified, of which 16 species are new to Madeira. There was low similarity between the fauna recorded and known previously on the island. The observed species richness was higher than the predictions by the island biogeography models for Madeira. CCA revealed a strong influence of anthropogenic land use on crustaceans. Anthropogenic transformations locally led to the depletion of fauna, but on the island scale they contributed to the increase of species richness including seven putative alien species. An increase in the artificial land cover and a decrease in the forest areas could lead to a further shift in the domination of non-indigenous microcrustaceans. © 2023 European Regional Centre for Ecohydrology of the Polish Academy of Sciences",0,1,0.99522203,negatives
