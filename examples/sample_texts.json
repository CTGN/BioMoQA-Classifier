    "abstract": "This study investigates the effects of climate change on biodiversity patterns in marine ecosystems. We analyzed species composition data from coral reefs across multiple geographical locations over a 10-year period. Our findings show significant shifts in species distribution correlating with temperature increases and ocean acidification levels.",
